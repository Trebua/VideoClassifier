Music The Sound of Silence
Simon amp Garfunkel Hello voice mail my old friend Ive called for tech support again I ignored my bosss warning I called on a Monday morning Now its evening and my dinner
first grew cold and then grew mold Im still on hold Im listening to the sounds of silence I dont think you understand I think your phone lines are unmanned I punched every touch tone I was told but Ive still spent  hours on hold Its not enough your software
crashed my Mac and it constantly hangs and bombs  it erased my ROMs Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys Say your motorcycle crashes Blood comes gushing from your gashes With your fading strength you call 
and you pray for a trained MD But you get me And you listen to the sounds of silence Music Thank you Good evening and welcome to Spot the TED Presenter Who Used
to Be a Broadway Accompanist When I was offered the Times
column six years ago the deal was like this youll be sent the coolest hottest
slickest new gadgets Every week itll arrive at your door You get to try them out
play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out
before you have to send them back and youll get paid for it You can think about it if you want So Ive always been a technology nut
and I absolutely love it The job though came with one
small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address
at the end of every column And what Ive noticed is  first of all
you get an incredible amount of email If you ever are feeling lonely get a New York Times column because you will get hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of emails And the email Im getting a lot
today is about frustration People are feeling like things  Ok I just had an alarm
come up on my screen Lucky you cant see it People are feeling overwhelmed Theyre feeling like
its too much technology too fast It may be good technology but I feel like theres not enough
of a support structure Theres not enough help Theres not enough thought
put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use One time I wrote a column about my efforts
to reach Dell Technical Support and within  hours
there were  messages from readers on the feedback boards
on the Times website from users saying Me too and heres my tale of woe I call it software rage And man let me tell you whoever figures out how to make money
off of this frustration will  Oh how did that
get up there Just kidding Ok so why is the problem accelerating And part of the problem is ironically because the industry
has put so much thought into making things easier to use Ill show you what I mean This is what the computer
interface used to look like DOS Over the years its gotten easier to use This is the original Mac operating system Reagan was President
Madonna was still a brunette And the entire operating system  this is the good part  the entire
operating system fit in  k You couldnt put
the Mac OS X logo in  k So the irony is that as these
things became easier to use a less technical broader audience
was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time I once had the distinct privilege
of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day The guy had a duplicate headset
for me to listen to And the calls that 
you know how they say Your call may be recorded
for quality assurance Uhuh Your call may be recorded so that they can collect
the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD Which they do And I have a copy Its in your gift bag No no With your voices on it So some of the stories are just
so classic and yet so understandable A woman called Apple to complain
that her mouse was squeaking Making a squeaking noise And the technician said Well maam what do you mean
your mouse is squeaking She says All I can tell you
is that it squeaks louder the faster I move it across the screen And the technicians like Maam youve got the mouse
up against the screen She goes Well the message said
Click here to continue Well if you like that one 
how much time have we got Another one a guy called 
this is absolutely true  his computer had crashed
and he told the technician he couldnt restart it no matter
how many times he typed  And the technician said
What Why are you typing  He said The message says
Error Type  So we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely
at the feet of the users But why is the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerating now In the hardware world its because
we the consumers want everything to be smaller
smaller smaller So the gadgets are getting
tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially
staying the same size So it gets to be more and more
of a challenge Software is subject
to another primal force the mandate to release
more and more versions When you buy a piece of software its not like buying a vase
or a candy bar where you own it Its more like joining a club
where you pay dues every year and every year they say Weve added more features
and well sell it to you for  I know one guy whos spent 
just on Photoshop over the years And software companies make
 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox  which is that if you improve
a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it I mean Microsoft Word was last
just a word processor in you know the Eisenhower administration But whats the alternative Microsoft actually did this experiment They said Well wait a minute Everyone complains that
were adding so many features Lets create a word processor
thats just a word processor Simple pure does not do web pages
is not a database And it came out
and it was called Microsoft Write And none of you are nodding
in acknowledgment because it died It tanked No one ever bought it I call this the Sport Utility Principle People like to surround themselves
with unnecessary power right They dont need the database
and the website but theyre like Well Ill upgrade because I might
you know I might need that someday So the problem is as you add more
features where are they going to go Where are you going to stick them
You only have so many design tools You can do buttons you can do
sliders popup menus submenus But if youre not careful
about how you choose you wind up with this This is an unretouched 
this is not a joke  unretouched photo of Microsoft Word the copy that you have
with all the toolbars open Youve obviously never
opened all the toolbars but all you have to type in
is this little teeny window down here And weve arrived at the age
of interface matrices where there are so many
features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word
is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically The off switch is in there somewhere Im telling you  its there Part of the art of designing
a simple good interface is knowing when to use
which one of these features So here is the logoff
dialogue box for Windows  There are only four choices so why are they in a popup menu Its not like the rest of the screen
is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices They could have put them all out in view Heres Apples take
on the exact same dialogue box Thank you  yes I designed
the dialogue box No no Already we can see
that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent
approach to software design Microsofts approach
to simplicity tends to be lets break it down
lets just make it more steps There are these wizards everywhere And you know theres a new version
of Windows coming out this fall If they continue at this pace
theres absolutely no telling where they might wind up Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Ok Ill bite Lets click Next to continue From the dropdown menu choose
the first letter you want to type Ok So there is a limit
that we dont want to cross So what is the answer How do you pack in all these features
in a simple intelligent way I believe in consistency when possible realworld equivalents trash can folder when possible
label things mostly But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules
if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence Now what do I mean by that Im going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something
not consistent but its better If you are buying something on the web youre supposed to put in your address and youre supposed to choose
what country youre from ok There are  countries in the world We like to think of the Internet
as a global village Im sorry its not one yet Its mainly like the United States
Europe and Japan So why is United States in the Us You have to scroll like
seven screensful to get to it Now it would be inconsistent
to put United States first but it would be intelligent This ones been touched on before but why in Gods name do you
shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called Start Heres another pet one of mine
you have a printer Most of the time you want to print
one copy of your document in page order on that printer So why in Gods name do you see
this every time you print Its like a  shuttle cockpit And one of the buttons at the bottom
youll notice is not Print Now Im not saying that Apple
is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity Palm is also especially in the old days
wonderful about this I actually got to speak to Palm
when they were flying high in the s and after the talk
I met one of the employees He says Nice talk And I said
Thank you What do you do here He said Im a tap counter
Im like Youre a what He goes Well Jeff Hawkins
the CEO says If any task on the Palm Pilot
takes more than three taps of the stylus its too long
and it has to be redesigned So Im the tap counter So Im going to show you an example of a company that does not
have a tap counter This is Microsoft Word Ok when you want to create
a new blank document in Word  it could happen You go up to the File menu
and you choose New Now what happens when you choose New Do you get a new blank document You do not On the opposite side of the monitor
a task bar appears and somewhere in those links 
by the way not at the top  somewhere in those links is a button
that makes you a new document Ok so that is a company
not counting taps You know I dont want to just stand
here and make fun of Microsoft  Yes I do The Bill Gates song Piano music Ive been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS I put my software and IBM together I got profit and they got the loss I write the code
that makes the whole world run Im getting royalties from everyone Sometimes its garbage
but the press is snowed You buy the box Ill sell the code Every software company
is doing Microsofts RampD You cant keep a good idea
down these days Even Windows is a hack Were kind of based loosely on the Mac So its big so its slow
Youve got nowhere to go Im not doing this for praise I write the code
that fits the world today Big mediocrity in every way Weve entered planet domination mode Youll have no choice youll buy my code I am Bill Gates and I write the code But actually I believe
there are really two Microsofts Theres the old one responsible
for Windows and Office Theyre dying to throw the whole thing
out and start fresh but they cant Theyre locked in because so many addons
and other company stuff locks into the old  chassis But theres also a new Microsoft thats really doing good
simple interface designs I liked the Media Center PC I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch The Wireless Watch
flopped miserably in the market but it wasnt because it wasnt
simply and beautifully designed But lets put it this way would you pay  a month to have a watch that has to be recharged
every night like your cell phone and stops working
when you leave your area code So the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch
is only going to get worse So is there any hope The screens are getting smaller
people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes things are coming out at a faster pace Its funny  when Steve Jobs
came back to Apple in  after  years away
it was the MacWorld Expo  he came to the stage
in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of did this The crowd went wild
but I had just seen  Im like where have I seen this before I had just seen the movie Evita  with Madonna and Im like you know what Ive got to do one about Steve Jobs Music It wont be easy
Youll think Im strange When I try to explain why Im back after telling the press
Apples future is black You wont believe me All that you see is a kid in his teens
who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz You try rhyming with garage Dont cry for me Cupertino The truth is I never left you I know the ropes now
know what the tricks are I made a fortune over at Pixar Dont cry for me Cupertino Ive still got the drive and vision I still wear sandals in any weather Its just that these days theyre Gucci leather Thank you So Steve Jobs had always believed
in simplicity and elegance and beauty And the truth is for years I was a little depressed because Americans
obviously did not value it because the Mac had
three percent market share Windows had  percent market share  people did not think it was worth
putting a price on it So I was a little depressed And then I heard Al Gores talk and I realized I didnt know
the meaning of depressed But it turns out I was wrong right Because the iPod came out and it violated every bit
of common wisdom Other products cost less
other products had more features they had voice recorders
and FM transmitters The other products were backed
by Microsoft with an open standard not Apples propriety standard But the iPod won 
this is the one they wanted The lesson was simplicity sells And there are signs that the industry
is getting the message This is a little company thats done
very well with simplicity and elegance The Sonos thing  its catching on Ive got just a couple examples Physically a really cool
elegant thinking coming along lately When you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures
back to your computer Well you either haul around a USB cable or you buy a card reader
and haul that around Either one youre going to lose What I do is I take out the memory card and I fold it in half
revealing USB contacts I just stick it in the computer
offload the pictures put it right back in the camera I never have to lose anything Heres another example Chris youre the source of all power
Will you be my power plug Chris Anderson Oh yeah
DP Hold that and dont let go You mightve seen this
this is Apples new laptop This the power cord
It hooks on like this And Im sure every one of you has done
this at some point in your lives or one of your children You walk along  and Im
about to pull this onto the floor I dont care Its a loaner Here we go Whoa Its magnetic  it doesnt pull
the laptop onto the floor In my very last example  I do a lot of my work
using speech recognition software And Ill just 
you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous Speech recognition
software is really great for doing emails very quickly period Like I get hundreds of them
a day period And its not just what I dictate
that it writes down period I also use this feature
called voice macros period Correct dissuade Not just Ok this is not an ideal situation because its getting the echo
from the hall and stuff The point is I can respond to people
very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out
a much longer thing So if somebody
sends me a fan letter Ill say Thanks for that Thank you so much
for taking the time to write  And conversely if somebody
sends me hate mail  which happens daily  I say Piss off I admire your frankness  So thats my dirty little secret
Dont tell anyone So the point is 
this is a really interesting story This is version eight of this software and do you know what they put
in version eight No new features Its never
happened before in software The company put no new features They just said Well make
this software work right Right Because for years people had bought
this software tried it out   percent accuracy was all they got which means one in  words is wrong  and theyd put it in their drawer And the company got sick of that so they said This version
were not going to do anything but make sure its darned accurate And so thats what they did This cult of doing things right
is starting to spread So my final advice for those of you
who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesnt work
its not necessarily you ok It could be the design
of the thing youre using Be aware in life
of good design and bad design And if youre among the people
who create this stuff Easy is hard Presweat the details for your audience Count the taps Remember the hard part
is not deciding what features to add its deciding what to leave out And best of all your motivation is
simplicity sells CA Bravo DP Thank you very much CA Hear hear
