1,"Thank you so much Chris And its truly a great honor
to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice
Im extremely grateful I have been blown away by this conference and I want to thank all of you
for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night And I say that sincerely partly because Mock sob I need that Put yourselves in my position I flew on Air Force Two for eight years Now I have to take off my shoes
or boots to get on an airplane Ill tell you one quick story to illustrate what
thats been like for me Its a true story 
every bit of this is true Soon after Tipper and I left the 
Mock sob White House  we were driving from our home
in Nashville to a little farm we have  miles east of Nashville Driving ourselves I know it sounds like
a little thing to you but  I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me There was no motorcade back there Youve heard of phantom limb pain This was a rented Ford Taurus It was dinnertime and we started looking for a place to eat We were on I We got to Exit  Lebanon Tennessee We got off the exit
we found a Shoneys restaurant Lowcost family restaurant chain
for those of you who dont know it We went in and sat down at the booth
and the waitress came over made a big commotion over Tipper She took our order and then went
to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear
what she was saying And she said Yes thats former
Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper And the man said Hes come down a long way hasnt he Theres been kind
of a series of epiphanies The very next day
continuing the totally true story I got on a GV to fly to Africa
to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Lagos
on the topic of energy And I began the speech
by telling them the story of what had just happened
the day before in Nashville And I told it pretty much the same way
Ive just shared it with you Tipper and I were driving ourselves Shoneys lowcost
family restaurant chain what the man said  they laughed I gave my speech then went back
out to the airport to fly back home I fell asleep on the plane until during the middle
of the night we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling I woke up they opened the door
I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man
running across the runway And he was waving a piece
of paper and he was yelling Call Washington Call Washington And I thought to myself
in the middle of the night in the middle of the Atlantic what in the world could be
wrong in Washington Then I remembered
it could be a bunch of things But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services
in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America It was printed in Monterey I checked And the story began Former Vice President Al Gore
announced in Nigeria yesterday quote My wife Tipper and I have opened
a lowcost family restaurant  named Shoneys and we are running it ourselves Before I could get back to US soil David Letterman and Jay Leno
had already started in on  one of them had me
in a big white chefs hat Tipper was saying
One more burger with fries Three days later I got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and partner
and colleague Bill Clinton saying Congratulations
on the new restaurant Al We like to celebrate
each others successes in life I was going to talk
about information ecology But I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit
of coming back to TED that maybe I could talk
about that another time Chris Anderson Its a deal Al Gore I want to focus
on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on What can you do about the climate crisis I want to start with a couple of  Im going to show some new images and Im going to recapitulate
just four or five Now the slide show I update the slide show
every time I give it I add new images because I learn more about it
every time I give it Its like beachcombing you know Every time the tide comes in and out
you find some more shells Just in the last two days we got
the new temperature records in January This is just for
the United States of America Historical average
for Januarys is  degrees last month was  degrees Now I know that you wanted some more
bad news about the environment  Im kidding But these are the recapitulation slides and then Im going to go into new
material about what you can do But I wanted to elaborate
on a couple of these First of all this is where
were projected to go with the US contribution
to global warming under business as usual Efficiency in enduse electricity
and enduse of all energy is the lowhanging fruit Efficiency and conservation 
its not a cost its a profit The sign is wrong Its not negative its positive These are investments
that pay for themselves But they are also very effective
in deflecting our path Cars and trucks  I talked
about that in the slideshow but I want you to put it in perspective Its an easy visible target of concern  and it should be  but there is more global warming pollution
that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks Cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest
standards in the world And so we should address that
But its part of the puzzle Other transportation efficiency
is as important as cars and trucks Renewables at the current levels
of technological efficiency can make this much difference And with what Vinod and John Doerr
and others many of you here  there are a lot of people
directly involved in this  this wedge is going to grow
much more rapidly than the current projection shows it Carbon Capture and Sequestration 
thats what CCS stands for  is likely to become the killer app
that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels
in a way that is safe Not quite there yet OK Now what can you do Reduce emissions in your home Most of these expenditures
are also profitable Insulation better design Buy green electricity where you can I mentioned automobiles  buy a hybrid Use light rail Figure out some of the other options
that are much better Its important Be a green consumer You have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect
on the global climate crisis Consider this Make a decision to live
a carbonneutral life Those of you who are good at branding Id love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way
that connects with the most people It is easier than you think It really is A lot of us in here
have made that decision and it is really pretty easy It means reduce
your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range
of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not
completely reduced And what it means is elaborated
at climatecrisisnet There is a carbon calculator Participant Productions convened  with my active involvement  the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science
of carbon calculation to construct a consumerfriendly
carbon calculator You can very precisely calculate
what your CO emissions are and then you will be given
options to reduce And by the time the movie
comes out in May this will be updated to  and we will have clickthrough
purchases of offsets Next consider making
your business carbonneutral Again some of us have done that and its not as hard as you think Integrate climate solutions
into all of your innovations whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design
and architecture community Invest sustainably Majora mentioned this Listen if you have invested money
with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance dont ever again complain
about quarterly report CEO management Over time people do
what you pay them to do And if they judge how much
theyre going to get paid on your capital that theyve invested based on the shortterm returns youre going to get shortterm decisions A lot more to be said about that Become a catalyst of change Teach others learn about it
talk about it The movie is a movie version
of the slideshow I gave two nights ago
except its a lot more entertaining And it comes out in May Many of you here have the opportunity
to ensure that a lot of people see it Consider sending somebody to Nashville Pick well And I am personally going to train people
to give this slideshow  repurposed with some
of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and its not just the slides
its what they mean And its how they link together And so Im going to be conducting
a course this summer for a group of people that are
nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and were going to update the slideshow
for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge Working with Larry Lessig it will be
somewhere in that process posted with tools
and limiteduse copyrights so that young people can remix it
and do it in their own way Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay
arms length from politics It doesnt mean
that if youre a Republican that Im trying to convince you
to be a Democrat We need Republicans as well This used to be a bipartisan issue and I know that
in this group it really is Become politically active Make our democracy work the way
its supposed to work Support the idea of capping
carbon dioxide emissions  global warming pollution 
and trading it Heres why as long as the United States
is out of the world system its not a closed system Once it becomes a closed system
with US participation then everybody
whos on a board of directors  how many people here
serve on the board of directors of a corporation Once its a closed system you will have legal liability
if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing
and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided The market will work
to solve this problem  if we can accomplish this Help with the mass persuasion campaign
that will start this spring We have to change the minds
of the American people Because presently the politicians
do not have permission to do what needs to be done And in our modern country the role
of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power
the way it once did Its now repetition of short hotbutton
second second television ads We have to buy a lot of those ads Lets rebrand global warming
as many of you have suggested I like climate crisis
instead of climate collapse but again those of you
who are good at branding I need your help on this Somebody said the test
were facing now a scientist told me is whether the combination
of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination Thats really true I said the other night
and Ill repeat now this is not a political issue Again the Republicans here 
this shouldnt be partisan You have more influence
than some of us who are Democrats do This is an opportunity Not just this but connected
to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them We are one Thank you very much I appreciate it ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

2,"In terms of invention Id like to tell you the tale
of one of my favorite projects I think its one of the most exciting
that Im working on but I think its also the simplest Its a project that has the potential
to make a huge impact around the world It addresses one of the biggest
health issues on the planet the number one cause of death
in children under five Which is  Waterborne diseases
Diarrhea Malnutrition No Its breathing the smoke
from indoor cooking fires  acute respiratory infections
caused by this Can you believe that I find this shocking
and somewhat appalling Cant we make
cleaner burning cooking fuels Cant we make better stoves How is it that this can lead
to over two million deaths every year I know Bill Joy was talking to you
about the wonders of carbon nanotubes so Im going to talk to you
about the wonders of carbon macrotubes which is charcoal So this is a picture of rural Haiti Haiti is now  percent deforested Youll see scenes like this
all over the island It leads to all sorts
of environmental problems and problems that affect people
throughout the nation A couple years ago
there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths  thats directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills
to stabilize the soil So the rains come  they go down the rivers
and the flooding happens Now one of the reasons
why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood
and they make charcoal in order to do it Its not that people are ignorant
to the environmental damage They know perfectly well
but they have no other choice Fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesnt cook the way
that they like their food prepared And so this is what they do Youll find families like this who go out
into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it So not surprisingly theres a lot of effort thats been done
to look at alternative cooking fuels About four years ago I took
a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with
Peace Corps volunteers there This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built
in the village where he worked And the idea was
that you could take waste paper you could compress it and make briquettes
that could be used for fuel But this device was very slow So our engineering students
went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple
the throughput of this device So you could imagine
they were very excited about it And they took the briquettes back to MIT
so that they could test them And one of the things
that they found was they didnt burn So it was a little
discouraging to the students And in fact if you look closely right here you can see
it says US Peace Corps As it turns out there actually wasnt
any waste paper in this village And while it was a good use
of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it
back with him to his village it was  kilometers away And so we thought perhaps
there might be a better way to come up with
an alternative cooking fuel What we wanted to do
is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was
readily available on the local level You see these all over Haiti as well Theyre smallscale sugar mills And the waste product from them after you extract the juice
from the sugarcane is called bagasse It has no other use It has no nutritional value
so they dont feed it to the animals It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill
until eventually they burn it What we wanted to do was
we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource
and turn it into a fuel that would be something
that people could easily cook with something like charcoal So over the next couple of years students and I worked
to develop a process So you start with the bagasse
and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of
a waste fifty fivegallon oil drum After some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen
that goes into the kiln and then you end up
with this carbonized material here However you cant burn this Its too fine and it burns too quickly
to be useful for cooking So we had to try to find a way
to form it into useful briquettes And conveniently
one of my students was from Ghana and he remembered a dish his mom
used to make for him called kokonte which is a very sticky porridge
made out of the cassava root And so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava
is indeed grown in Haiti under the name of manioc In fact its grown all over the world  yucca tapioca manioc cassava
its all the same thing  a very starchy root vegetable And you can make a very thick
sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together
the charcoal briquettes So we did this We went down to Haiti These are the graduates
of the first Ecole de Charbon or Charcoal Institute And these  Thats right So Im actually
an instructor at MIT as well as CIT And these are the briquettes that we made Now Im going to take you
to a different continent This is India and this is the most commonly used
cooking fuel in India Its cow dung And more than in Haiti
this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see
the health impacts of cooking with cow dung
and biomass as a fuel Kids and women
are especially affected by it because theyre the ones
who are around the cooking fires So we wanted to see if we could introduce
this charcoalmaking technology there Well unfortunately
they didnt have sugarcane and they didnt have cassava but that didnt stop us What we did was we found what were
the locally available sources of biomass And there was wheat straw
and there was rice straw in this area And what we could use as a binder
was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel And we did sidebyside tests and here you can see
the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung And you can see that its a lot cleaner
burning of a cooking fuel And in fact it heats the water
a lot more quickly And so we were very happy thus far But one of the things that we found was when we did sidebyside
comparisons with wood charcoal it didnt burn as long And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart
as they were cooking So we wanted to try to find a way
to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with
wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti So we went back to MIT we took out the Instron machine and we figured out
what sort of forces you needed in order to compress
a briquette to the level that you actually are getting
improved performance out of it And at the same time that we had
students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners in Haiti
working to develop the process to improve it and make it more accessible
to people in the villages there And after some time we developed a lowcost press
that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns not only  actually it burns longer
cleaner than wood charcoal So now were in a situation
where we have a product which is actually better than what
you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace which is a very wonderful place to be In Haiti alone about  million trees
are cut down every year Theres a possibility
of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those In addition the revenue generated
from that charcoal is  million dollars Thats an awful lot
for a country like Haiti  with a population of eight million and an average income
of less than  dollars So this is where were also moving ahead
with our charcoal project And one of the things
that I think is also interesting is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley
whos been doing risk analysis And hes looked at the problem
of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal And hes found that worldwide
you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood
to charcoal as a cooking fuel Thats remarkable but up until now there werent ways
to do it without cutting down trees But now we have a way thats using an agricultural
waste material to create a cooking fuel One of the really exciting things though is something that came out of the trip
that I took to Ghana just last month And I think its the coolest thing and its even lower tech
than what you just saw if you can imagine such a thing Here it is So what is this This is corncobs turned into charcoal And the beauty of this is
that you dont need to form briquettes  it comes ready made This is my  laptop right here And actually like Nick
I brought samples So we can pass these around Theyre fully functional
fieldtested ready to roll out And I think one of the things which is also remarkable
about this technology is that the technology
transfer is so easy Compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we have to teach people
how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step
of cooking the binder this comes prebriquetted And this is about the most exciting
thing in my life right now which is perhaps
a sad commentary on my life But once you see it
like you guys in the front row  All right yeah OK So anyway  Here it is And this is I think a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about
in those nonzerosum things So not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits But this is one
of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits People can make their own cooking fuel
from waste products They can generate income from this They can save the money
that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess
and sell it in the market to people who arent making their own Its really rare
that you dont have tradeoffs between health and economics
or environment and economics So this is a project
that I just find extremely exciting and Im really looking forward
to see where it takes us So when we talk about now
the future we will create one of the things
that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision
of the world that we live in And now I dont actually mean
the world that we live in I mean the world where women
spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat I mean the world
where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles
that are made by hand and where when you work  hours a day youre still only earning
 dollars in a month I mean the world where women and children spend
 billion hours a year fetching water Thats as if the entire workforce
of the state of California worked full time for a year
doing nothing but fetching water Its a place where
for example if this were India in this room only three of us
would have a car If this were Afghanistan only one person in this room
would know how the use the Internet If this were Zambia   of you would be farmers  of you would have AIDS or HIV And more than half of you would be living
on less than a dollar a day These are the issues that we
need to come up with solutions for These are the issues that
we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people
our entrepreneurs to be facing These are the solutions
that we need to find I have a few areas that I believe
are especially important that we address One of them is creating technologies to promote microfinance
and microenterprise so that people who are living
below the poverty line can find a way to move out  and that theyre not doing it using the same traditional
basket making poultry rearing etc But there are new technologies
and new products that they can make on a small scale The next thing I believe is that we need to create
technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops And we need to rethink
our development strategies so that were not promoting
educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers but rather to stop being poor farmers And we need to think
about how we can do that effectively We need to work with the people
in these communities and give them the resources
and the tools that they need to solve their own problems Thats the best way to do it We shouldnt be doing it from outside So we need to create this future
and we need to start doing it now Thank you Chris Anderson Thank you incredible Stay here Tell us  just while we see
if someone has a question  just tell us about one of the other things
that youve worked on Amy Smith Some of the other
things were working on are ways to do lowcost
water quality testing so that communities can maintain
their own water systems know when theyre working
know when they treat them etc Were also looking at lowcost
watertreatment systems One of the really exciting things
is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability
to be able to do that CA Whats the bottleneck
preventing this stuff getting from scale Do you need to find entrepreneurs
or venture capitalists or what do you need to take
what youve got and get it to scale AS I think its large numbers
of people moving it forward Its a difficult thing  its a marketplace
which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income So you cant use the same models
that you use in the United States for making things move forward And were a pretty small staff which is me So you know
I do what I can with the students We have  students a year
go out into the field and try to implement this
and move it forward The other thing is you have to do things
with a long time frame as you know you cant expect to get
something done in a year or two years you have to be looking
five or  years ahead But I think with the vision to do that
we can move forward ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

3,A public Dewey long ago observed is constituted through discussion and debate If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question and avoid doxa the realm of the unquestioned then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time namely how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building To put the assumptions very clearly capitalism after  years has become acceptable and so has democracy If we looked in the world of  and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities they were the rare exception not the norm The question now however is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions And that provides the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment allows us to act And it is necessary no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus to be able to move forward But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights about denial of justice rather than provision of it And in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences First extractive industry Blood diamonds smuggled emeralds timber that is cut right from under the poorest Second is technical assistance And technical assistance might shock you but its the worst form of  today  of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to  dollars a day who are incapable of thinking creatively or organically Next assumption  and of course the events of July  I express my deep sympathy and before that September   have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds We live in one world But thats easily said But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in And that is that if we want to have one world this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion and then inclusion for some We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics What is one of these organizations to pick We have three critical terms economy civil society and the state I will not deal with those first two except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions from one context to another can only make for disaster Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia Textbook economics does not work in my context and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling for which I have enormous respect My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best Second instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state why dont we simplify and say what are a series of functions that the state in the st century must perform Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this we hope to share that much widely with  and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places So what are these functions We propose  And its legitimate monopoly of means of violence administrative control management of public finances investment in human capital provision of citizenship rights provision of infrastructure management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation creation of the market international agreements including public borrowing and then most importantly rule of law I wont elaborate I hope the questions will give me an opportunity This is a feasible goal basically because contrary to widespread assumption I would argue that we know how to do this Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of  But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning And there are lots of other examples Now in order to do this  and this brings this group  we have to rethink the notion of capital The least important form of capital in this project is financial capital  money Money is not capital in most of the developing countries Its just cash Because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into capital And what is required is a combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital  and security of course is critical but so is information Now the issue that should concern us here  and thats the challenge that I would like to pose to this group  is again it takes  years in your countries to produce somebody with a BS degree It takes  years to produce somebody with a PhD The first challenge is to rethink fundamentally the issue of the time Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited Our educational systems are inherited from the th century What is it that we need to do fundamentally to reengage in a project that capital formation is rapid The absolute majority of the worlds population are below  and they are growing larger and faster They need different ways of being approached different ways of being enfranchised different ways of being skilled And thats the first thing Second is youre problem solvers but youre not engaging your global responsibility Youve stayed away from the problems of corruption You only want clean environments in which to function But if you dont think through the problems of corruption who will You stay away from design for development Youre great designers but your designs are selfish Its for your own immediate use The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads or dams or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in  years This is not right It requires thinking But particularly what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work As the work on paradigms long time ago showed  Thomas Kuhns work  its in the intersection of ideas that new developments  true breakthroughs  occur And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the worlds poor through this means Thank you Chris Anderson So Ashraf until recently you were the finance minister of Afghanistan a country right at the middle of much of the worlds agenda Is the country gonna make it Will democracy flourish What scares you most Ashraf Ghani What scares me most is  is you lack of your engagement You asked me You know I always give the unconventional answer No But seriously the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as at least a  to year perspective Today the world of globalization is on speed Time has been compressed And space does not exist for most people But in my world  you know when I went back to Afghanistan after  years space had expanded Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down I rode  traveled  travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took  So the first is when the scale is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure  it takes six years to deliver infrastructure In our world Any meaningful sort of thing But the modality of attention or what is happening today whats happening tomorrow Second is when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense brutal forms of exercise of power  we had the Red Army for  continuous years  strong literally terrorizing The sky every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear We were bombed practically out of existence Then tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism  from all sides The United States Great Britain joined for instance Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror How to turn a donkey a carthorse anything And the Russians equally So when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan its because of that legacy But we have to understand that weve been incredibly lucky I mean I really cant believe how lucky I am here standing in front of you speaking When I joined as finance minister I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent Those were the risks They were worth it I think we can make it and the reason we can make it is because of the people You see because I mean  I give you one statistic  percent of the men in Afghanistan  percent of the women listen to at least three radio stations a day In terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world I think that I would dare say theyre much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans  because the world matters to them And what is their predominant concern Abandonment Afghans have become deeply internationalist You know when I went back in December of  I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because Id lived as a nationalist And I told them  my people with the Americans here  separate Yes I have an advisory position with the UN I went through  Afghan provinces very rapidly And everybody was telling me it was a different world You know they engage They see engagement global engagement as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is  Clare Lockhart is here so Ill recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan And that woman said she didnt care whether she had food on her table What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future where her children could really have a different life That gives me hope CA How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade AG Certainly Well the first is instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies they should give this hundred billion dollars to  of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs The key to the drug eradication is jobs Look theres a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of  dollars dont produce drugs Second textile Trade is the key not aid The US and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff The textile industry is incredibly mobile If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector if there was zero tariffs  would create the type of job Cotton does not compete with opium a tshirt does And we need to understand its the value chain Look the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit It is important but what the ordinary women and men who engage in microproduction want is global access They dont want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners  and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms Yeah we have the best embroiderers in the world Why cant we do what was done with northern Italy With the Put Out system So I think economically the critical issue really is to now think through And what I will say here is that aid doesnt work You know the aid system is broken The aid system does not have the knowledge the vision the ability Im all for it after all I raised a lot of it Yeah to be exact you know I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country  billion They didnt want to give us the money CA And it still didnt work AG No Its not that it didnt work Its that a dollar of private investment in my judgment is equal at least to  dollars of aid in terms of the dynamic that it generates Second is that one dollar of aid could be  cents it could be  cents or it could be four dollars It depends on what form it comes what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it You know the aid system at first was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries not to generate growth in the poor countries And this is again one of those assumptions  the way car seats are an assumption that weve inherited in governments and doors You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries provide advice but they do Theres an entire weight of history visavis aid that now needs to be reexamined If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves  and Im putting that proposition equally you know Im very harsh on my counterparts  aid must end in each country in a definable period And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy Unless that kind of compact is entered into you will not be able to sustain

4,"I want to start off by saying Houston we have a problem Were entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space In fact weve regressed We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done And that is instinctively weve gone out and climbed over difficult places went to more hostile places and found out later maybe to our surprise that thats the reason we survived And I feel very strongly that its not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that its OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it They need to look forward to exploration they need to look forward to colonization they need to look forward to breakthroughs We need to inspire them because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future Im particularly troubled that what NASAs doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to  for this next decade and a half  oh shoot I screwed up We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics What were looking forward to is  what were looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country  the Boeings and Lockheeds space engineers  to go out and take risks and try new stuff Were going to go back to the moon   years later And were going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new Im really troubled by that But anyway thats  the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later Thats the theme of my next  minutes here And I think that the inspiration begins when youre very young
 threeyearolds up to  yearolds What they look at is the most important thing Lets take a snapshot at aviation And there was a wonderful little short fouryear time period when marvelous things happened It started in  when the Wright brothers flew in Paris and everybody said Ooh hey I can do that Theres only a few people that have flown in early  In four years  countries had hundreds of airplanes thousand of pilots Airplanes were invented by natural selection Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes There were probably at least  different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot dont try that again The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition So we by making a whole bunch of attempts thousands of attempts in that fouryear time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today And thats why theyre so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to find whats good That has not happened at all in space flying Theres only been two concepts tried  two by the US and one by the Russians Well who was inspired during that time period Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first  years of aviation And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation Well what happened when I was a little kid was  some pretty heavy stuff too The jet age started the missile age started Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars  and this was before Sputnik And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now We thought thered be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right But you know NASA screwed that up because theyve sent these robots and theyve landed it only in the deserts If you look at what happened  this little black line is as fast as man ever flew and the red line is topoftheline military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport You notice heres a big jump when I was a little kid  and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people werent having the courage to try Well what did I do when I was a kid I didnt do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we didnt have drugs in those days But I did competition model airplanes I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flighttesting airplanes for the Air Force And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages And some  of those are flying Of course one of them is around the world Voyager I founded another company in  which is my company now And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since  And theres a lot of them that I actually cant show you on this chart The most impressive airplane ever I believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly taken out of service We retreated in  back to something that was developed in  What The most impressive spaceship ever I believe was a Grumman Lunar Lander It was a  you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon didnt need any maintenance guys  thats kind of cool Weve lost that capability We abandoned it in  This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in  Three years and we cant do that now Crazy Talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they die out when theyre replaced by something else These things tend to happen every  years  years long with an overlap You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies The interesting thing  by the way the speed here excuse me higherspeed travel is the title of these innovation cycles There is none here These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC that was done in  Heres the biggie and that is you dont have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it You know a good example of course is the DARPA net Computers were used for artillery first then IRS But when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it Private sector has to do it Keep that in mind I put down innovation  Ive looked for innovation cycles in space I found none The very first year starting when Gagarin went in space and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world  the very first year In  everyone that the United States sent to space was killed There were only three or four flights in  In  there were only two flights two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five which was the number the same year back in  There is no growth Theres no activity Theres no nothing This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne This is a picture here taken from orbit Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that We know how to do it for suborbital flying now do it safe enough  at least as safe as the early airlines  so that can be done And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company Well first of all whats going to happen next The first industry will be a high volume a lot of players Theres another one announced just last week And it will be suborbital And the reason it has to be suborbital is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit The governments have been doing this  three governments have been doing this for  years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died Thats  You dont want to run a business with that kind of a safety record Itll be very high volume we think  people will fly by  I cant tell you when this will start because I dont want my competition to know my schedule But I think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly youll see those resort hotels in orbit And that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view And that will be really cool Because the moon doesnt have an atmosphere  you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by  feet if you want Oh its going to be so much fun OK My critics say Hey Rutans just spending a lot of these billionaires money for joyrides for billionaires Whats this This is not a transportation system its just for fun And I used to be bothered by that and then I got to thinking well wait a minute I bought my first Apple computer in  and I bought it because I could say I got a computer at my house and you dont What do you use it for Come over It does Frogger OK Not the banks computer or Lockheeds computer but the home computer was for games For a whole decade it was for fun  we didnt even know what it was for But what happened the fact that we had this big industry big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes  we were ripe for a new invention And the inventor is in this audience Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that something that we used for a whole year  excuse me  a whole decade for fun became everything  our commerce our research our communication and if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list Laughter And it wont be very long before you wont be able to convince kids that we didnt always have computers in our homes So fun is defendable OK I want to show you kind of a busy chart but in it is my prediction with whats going to happen And in it also brings up another point right here Theres a group of people that have come forward  and you dont know all of them  but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children this little three to yearold age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period Paul Allen Elan Musk Richard Branson Jeff Bezos the Ansari family which is now funding the Russians suborbital thing Bob Bigelow a private space station and Carmack These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and I think its a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something  but theyre putting it in very  areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct They were inspired by big progress But look at the progress thats going on after that There were a couple of examples here The military fighters had a  highestperformance military airplane was the SR It went a whole life cycle got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel It went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service And were stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late s But something is out there to inspire our kids now And Im talking about if youve got a baby now or if youve got a yearold now Whats out there is theres something really interesting going to happen here Relatively soon youll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highestperformance military operational airplane Its never happened before The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in  minutes why do you need something better But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying suborbital flights to space very soon  wait a minute whats happening here well have military fighters with suborbital capability and I think very soon this But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first OK I look forward to a new capitalists space race lets call it You remember the space race in the s was for national prestige because we lost the first two milestones We didnt lose them technically The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it  you can argue thats not a technical loss Sputnik wasnt a technical loss but it was a prestige loss America  the world saw America as not being the leader in technology and that was a very strong thing And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin not months or decades or whatever So we had the capability But America lost We lost And because of that we made a big jump to recover it Well again whats interesting here is weve lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America  cant do it You can buy it in Russia You can fly with Russian hardware This is available because a Russian space program is starving and its nice for them to get  million here and there to take one of the seats Its commercial It can be defined as space tourism They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like Apollo  was done  million bucks  hey I can go to the moon But you know would you have thought back in the s when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalistlike thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware And would you have thought would the Russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware the guys inside wont be Russians Maybe itll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire Well thats weird you know it really is But anyway I think we need to beat them again I think what well do is well see a successful very successful private space flight industry Whether were first or not really doesnt matter The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde And then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered OK well talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight This little thing says here five times what NASAs doing by  I want to tell you already theres about  billion to  billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all  already worldwide If you read  if you Google it youll find about half of that money but theres twice of that being committed out there  not spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few years Hey thats pretty big Im predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be  and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at  dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less  this is going to be very profitable I predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the US taxpayer spends for NASAs manned spacecraft work And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of  to  And what that means is before we know it the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight And that is because its us Its private industry You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff  and weve done it for a long time The NACA before NASA never developed an airliner and never ran an airline But NASA is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line OK And weve shied away from it because were afraid of it But starting back in June of  when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it can get a start with it everything changed after that time OK thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

5,What I want to talk about is as background is the idea that cars are art This is actually quite meaningful to me because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole  we dont do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it  and cars are thought so much as a product that its a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art And so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane  if you accept that  that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A Now at this point youre going to see a picture of Michelangelo This is completely different than automobiles Automobiles are selfmoving things right Elevators are automobiles And theyre not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for  years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways theyve also been a real pain in the ass because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve We have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion  but thats not what interests me in this speech What interests me in this speech is cars Automobiles may be what you use but cars are what we are in many ways And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and I believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like BMW is really hip on and lots of other things then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us  of this caryness  and what that means what we can learn from it Thats what I want to get to Cars are not a suit of clothes cars are an avatar Cars are an expansion of yourself they take your thoughts your ideas your emotions and they multiply it  your anger whatever Its an avatar Its a superwaldo that you happen to be inside of and if you feel sexy the car is sexy And if youre full of road rage youve got a Chevy Like a Rock right Cars are a sculpture  did you know this That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand Many people think Well its computers and its done by machines and stuff like that Well they reproduce it but the originals are all done by hand Its done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum That tension between the need to express the need to discover then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship Rules that say this is how you handle surfaces this is what control is all about this is how you show youre a master of your craft And that tension that discovery that push for something new  and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship  thats as strong in cars as it is in anything We work in clay which hasnt changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it and theres a very interesting analogy to that too Real quickly  Michelangelo once said hes there to discover the figure within OK There we go the automobile That was  years right there  did you catch that Between that one there and that one there it changed a lot didnt it OK its not marketing theres a very interesting car concept here but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here I want to talk about this Why it means you have to wash a car what is it that sensuality you have to touch about it Thats the sculpture that goes into it That sensuality And its done by men and women working just like this making cars Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore I believe that that pressure within that Moores talking about  at least when it comes to cars  comes right back to this idea of the mean Its that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me And we tell other people Do this do this do this until this thing comes alive We are completely infected And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness its quite wonderful This sculpture is of course at the heart of all of it and its really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars And its not a whole lot different really when theyre working like this or when somebody works like this Its that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty Now now I get to the point I want to talk about cars as art Art in the Platonic sense is truth its beauty and love Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers We dont really have a problem talking about love We dont have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense Thats what were searching for  when were working our craft we are really trying to find that truth out there Were not trying to find vanity and beauty Were trying to find the beauty in the truth However engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian instead of this quantum approach Were dealing with irrationalisms and were dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four and if you get  its better and  is even better And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why were doing what were doing Weve pretty much accepted the fact though that we are the women in the organization at BMW  BMW is a very manly type business  men men men its engineers And were kind of the female side to that Thats OK thats cool You go off and be manly Were going to be a little bit more female Because what were interested in is finding form thats more than just a function Were interested in finding beauty thats more than just an aesthetic its really a truth And I think this idea of soul as being at the heart of great cars is very applicable You all know it You know a car when youve seen it with soul You know how strong this is Well this experience of love and the experience of design to me are interchangeable And now Im coming to my story I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue And first of all you have to go with me for a second and say you know you could take the word love out of a lot of things in our society put the word design in and it still works like this quote here you know It kind of works you know You can understand that It works in truisms All is fair in design and war Certainly we live in a competitive society I think this one here theres a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me you know this is like you know this is like puppy love you know this is cool right Toothbrush cool It really only gets serious when you look at something like this OK This is one substitution that I believe all of us in design management are guilty of And this idea that there is more to love more to design when it gets down to your neighbor your other it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be But right now its in dealing with our own people our own teams who are doing the creating So to my story The idea of peoplework is what we work with here and I have to make a bond with my designers when were creating BMWs We have to have a shared intimacy a shared vision  that means we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way Theres good times theres interesting times and theres some stress times too You want to do cars youve got to go outside Youve got to do cars in the rain youve got to do cars in the snow Thats by the way is a presentation we made to our board of directors We haul their butts out in the snow too You want to know cars outside Well youve got to stand outside to do this And because these are artists they have very artistic temperaments All right Now one thing about art is art is discovery and art is discovering yourself through your art Right And one thing about cars is were all a little bit like Pygmalion we are completely in love with our own creations This is one of my favorite paintings it really describes our relationship with cars This is sick beyond belief But because of this the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension a new meaning We have a shared center we have a shared focus  that car stays at the middle of all our relationships And its my job in the competitive process to narrow this down I heard today about Josephs death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction You know thats what I have to do sometimes We start out with  cars we narrow it down to five cars down to three cars down to two cars down to one car and Im in the middle of that killing basically Someones love someones baby This is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this because their life is wrapped up in that too Theyve got that gene infected in them as well and they want that to live more than anything else Well this project Deep Blue put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected and I want to pass it on to you because I want you to reflect on this perhaps in your own relationships We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way wed done it that I only had a phone number that connected me to them So what we did was instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out whats the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America This is  we did this project And so we sent them off with this team name Deep Blue Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM  we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes theyd think were talking about computers It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue in a company like BMW has a hook  Deep Blue wow cool name So people get wrapped up in it And we took a team of designers and we sent them off to America And we gave them a budget what we thought was a set of deliverables a timetable and nothing else Like I said I just had a phone number that connected me to them And a group of engineers worked in Germany and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of whats the successor to the SUV They would come together compare notes Then they would work apart come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didnt pollute each others ideas  but at the same time came together and resolved the problems Hopefully really understand the customer at its heart where the customer is live with them in America So  sent the team off and actually something different happened They went other places They disappeared quite honestly and all I got was postcards Now I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls and pretty soon theyre in New York and I dont know where else And Im telling myself This is going to be a great car theyre doing research that Ive never even thought about before Right And they decided that instead of like having a studio and six or seven apartments it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylors exhouse in Malibu And  at least they told me it was her house I guess it was at one time she had a party there or something But anyway this was the house and they all lived there Now this is  living halfadozen people whod left their  some had left their wives behind and families behind and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America but the first three months were the most intensive And one of the young women in the project she was a fantastic lady she actually built her room in the bathroom The bathroom was so big she built the bed over the bathtub  its quite fascinating On the other hand I didnt know anything about this OK Nothing This is all going on and all Im getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas or whatever saying Dont worry Chris this is really going to be good OK So my concept of what a design studio was probably  I wasnt up to speed on where these guys were However the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin and you know these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer And one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings and these incredibly stressedout engineers would create some incredible solutions Well what I didnt know was and what we found out was  these guys they cant even like talk to each other under those conditions You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split in your dialog that is so deep and so far that they cannot bring this together at all And so we had our first meeting after three months in Tiburon which is just up the road from here  you know Tiburon And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr Goschel  who is now my boss and at that time he was comentor on the project  and they would present their results We would see where we were going we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America And so I had these ideas in my head that this is going to be great I mean Im going to see so much work its so intense  I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it and Im not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either  but somehow all this is going to come together and Im going to see some really great product So we went to Tiburon after three months and the team had gotten together the week before many days ahead of time The engineers flew over and designers got together with them and they put their presentation together Well it turns out that the engineers hadnt done anything And they hadnt done anything because  kind of like in car business engineers are there to solve problems and we were asking them to create a problem And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say This is the problem that weve created now help us solve it And they couldnt talk about it So what happened was the engineers showed up with nothing And the engineers told the designers If you go in with all your stuff well walk out well walk right out of the project So I didnt know any of this and we got a presentation that had an agenda looked like this There was a whole lot of dialog We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers And here Im expecting at any moment OK theyre going to turn the page and Im going to see the cars Im going to see the sketches Im going to see maybe some idea of where its going Dialog kept on going with mental maps of words and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance I was seriously being baffled with bullshit And if you can imagine what this is like to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working and theyre out there spending all this money and theyre learning and theyre doing all this stuff I went fucking ballistic right I went nuts You can probably remember Tiburon it used to look like this After four hours of this I stood up and I took this team apart I screamed at them I yelled at them What the hell are you doing Youre letting me down youre my designers youre supposed to be the creative ones what the hell is going on around here It was probably one of my better tirades I have some good ones but this was probably one of my better ones And I went into these people how could they take BMWs money how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing nothing Because of course they didnt tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings model concepts pictures  everything I wanted theyd locked up in the cars because they had shown solidarity with the engineers  and theyd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadnt realized of course that they couldnt do problem creating So we went to lunch  And Ive got to tell you this was one seriously quiet lunch The engineers all sat at one end of the table the designers and I sat at the other end of the table really quiet And I was just fucking furious furious OK Probably because they had all the fun and I didnt you know Thats what you get furious about right And somebody asked me about Catherine my wife you know did she fly out with me or something I said No and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married the priest gave a very nice sermon and he said something very important He said Love is not selfish he said Love does not mean counting how many times I say I love you It doesnt mean you had sex this many times this month and its two times less than last month so that means you dont love me as much Love is not selfish And I thought about this and I thought You know Im not showing love here Im seriously not showing love Im in the air Im in the air without trust This cannot be This cannot be that Im expecting a certain number of sketches and to me thats my quantification method for qualifying a team This cannot be So I told them this story I said Guys Im thinking about something here this isnt right I cant have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one Based on a dictate premise that says Im a boss you do what I say without trust I said This cant be Actually we all broke down into tears to be quite honest about it because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them not being able to show me what I wanted and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come And I think we felt much closer that day we cut a lot of strings that didnt need to be there and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about We put the car back at the center of our thoughts and we put love I think truly back into the center of the process By the way that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes  you see it downstairs the X Coupe  they had a lot of fun with that It was the rendition of our motorcycle the GS as Carl Magnusson says bruteiful as the idea of what could be a motorcycle if you add two more wheels And so in conclusion my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you was this one here Im also going to steal a little quote out of Little Prince Theres a lot to be said about trust and love if you know that those two words are synonymous for design I had a very very meaningful relationship with my team that day and its stayed that way ever since And I hope that you too find that theres more to design and more towards the art of the design than doing it yourself Its true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile Thanks so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

6,At the break I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate And this will be my only comment on it And that is I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists What Im going to tell you about in my  minutes is how were about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves Its only  years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a freeliving organism that of haemophilus influenzae That took a genome project from  years down to four months We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours So in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added most human pathogens a couple of plants several insects and several mammals including the human genome Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over  years ago was by the end of this year we might have between three and five genomes sequenced its on the order of several hundred We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence  genomes this year as a side project from environmental organisms So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed But as we look whats out there weve barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet Most people dont realize it because theyre invisible but microbes make up about a half of the Earths biomass whereas all animals only make up about one onethousandth of all the biomass And maybe its something that people in Oxford dont do very often but if you ever make it to the sea and you swallow a mouthful of seawater keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of  million viruses Less than  microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every  miles We started in Bermuda for our test project then moved up to Halifax working down the US East Coast the Caribbean Sea the Panama Canal through to the Galapagos then across the Pacific and were in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean Its very tough duty were doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science The experiments are incredibly simple We just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every  hours And with doing this weve made some amazing discoveries For example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes  there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments It turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication From one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered  million new genes and as many as  new species Weve extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation Were measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums We filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City And were in the process of sequencing all that at the present time Just on the data collection side just where we are through the Galapagos were finding that almost every  miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean Some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures  red being warm blue being cold  and we found theres a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant species The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence And these vary tremendously from region to region Maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where its mostly blue the photoreceptors tend to see blue light When theres a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light But they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data  including all of ours thus far from the expedition which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet  and it totaled around  million genes And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are Are we just discovering new members of known families or are we discovering new families And it turns out we have about  major gene families but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families So were at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes components and life on this planet When we look at the socalled evolutionary tree were up on the upper righthand corner with the animals Of those roughly  million genes we only have around  in our genome And if you take all animals together we probably share less than  and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution And we think in a genecentric view  maybe going back to Richard Dawkins ideas  than in a genomecentric view which are different constructs of these gene components Synthetic DNA the ability to synthesize DNA has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two and is getting very rapid and very cheap Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in  and that from mycoplasma genitalium And we have really nice Tshirts that say you know I heart my genitalium This is actually just a microorganism But it has roughly  genes Haemophilus had  genes And we simply asked the question if one species needs  another  is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system So we started doing transposon mutagenesis Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code And if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those nonessential genes But it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or nonessential gene based on exactly whats in the environment We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of  related organisms and we tried to compare all of those to see what they had in common And we got these overlapping circles And we found only  genes common to all  organisms The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around  or so So we think that we can expand or contract genomes depending on your point of view here to maybe  to  genes from the minimal of  The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them and we had to do this in a cassettebased fashion We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison my colleagues on this developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a base pair virus in only a twoweek period that was  percent accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology It was a quite exciting experiment  when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria This was not the first synthetic virus  a polio virus had been made a year before  but it was only one tenthousandth as active and it took three years to do This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X  This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and thats the notions that we have with biology People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee and a special committee the US government has set up to review this area And I think its important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with peoples imaginations Basically any virus thats been sequenced today  that genome can be made And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox but the DNA from this organism is not infective So even if somebody made the smallpox genome that DNA itself would not cause infections The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses And theres only two countries the US and the former Soviet Union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents If that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the knowhow to make designer viruses in the future I think singlecell organisms are possible within two years And possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade So were now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome The key is how do you put all of the others We start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome This is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about  to  hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart This organism is ubiquitous on the planet and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation The glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier Heres an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows the genome after  million rads of radiation The chromosome is literally blown apart And heres that same DNA automatically reassembled  hours later Its truly stunning that these organisms can do that and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that After these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues For example from the third organism we sequenced Methanococcus jannaschii  it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO it captures back from the environment So we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO and can capture that back So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere converting that into biopolymers or other products We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen Also theres numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products Within a short while I think theres going to be a new field called Combinatorial Genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day And therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether youre screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach Were trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen and we have an oxygeninsensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process Were also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce I think future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry Let me just close with ethical and policy studies We delayed the start of our experiments in  until we completed a yearandahalf bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species Every major religion participated in this It was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they couldnt find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be OK The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multiinstitutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area and were trying to set good examples as we go forward These are complex issues Except for the threat of bioterrorism theyre very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

7,"Music The Sound of Silence
Simon amp Garfunkel Hello voice mail my old friend Ive called for tech support again I ignored my bosss warning I called on a Monday morning Now its evening and my dinner
first grew cold and then grew mold Im still on hold Im listening to the sounds of silence I dont think you understand I think your phone lines are unmanned I punched every touch tone I was told but Ive still spent  hours on hold Its not enough your software
crashed my Mac and it constantly hangs and bombs  it erased my ROMs Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys Say your motorcycle crashes Blood comes gushing from your gashes With your fading strength you call 
and you pray for a trained MD But you get me And you listen to the sounds of silence Music Thank you Good evening and welcome to Spot the TED Presenter Who Used
to Be a Broadway Accompanist When I was offered the Times
column six years ago the deal was like this youll be sent the coolest hottest
slickest new gadgets Every week itll arrive at your door You get to try them out
play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out
before you have to send them back and youll get paid for it You can think about it if you want So Ive always been a technology nut
and I absolutely love it The job though came with one
small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address
at the end of every column And what Ive noticed is  first of all
you get an incredible amount of email If you ever are feeling lonely get a New York Times column because you will get hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of emails And the email Im getting a lot
today is about frustration People are feeling like things  Ok I just had an alarm
come up on my screen Lucky you cant see it People are feeling overwhelmed Theyre feeling like
its too much technology too fast It may be good technology but I feel like theres not enough
of a support structure Theres not enough help Theres not enough thought
put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use One time I wrote a column about my efforts
to reach Dell Technical Support and within  hours
there were  messages from readers on the feedback boards
on the Times website from users saying Me too and heres my tale of woe I call it software rage And man let me tell you whoever figures out how to make money
off of this frustration will  Oh how did that
get up there Just kidding Ok so why is the problem accelerating And part of the problem is ironically because the industry
has put so much thought into making things easier to use Ill show you what I mean This is what the computer
interface used to look like DOS Over the years its gotten easier to use This is the original Mac operating system Reagan was President
Madonna was still a brunette And the entire operating system  this is the good part  the entire
operating system fit in  k You couldnt put
the Mac OS X logo in  k So the irony is that as these
things became easier to use a less technical broader audience
was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time I once had the distinct privilege
of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day The guy had a duplicate headset
for me to listen to And the calls that 
you know how they say Your call may be recorded
for quality assurance Uhuh Your call may be recorded so that they can collect
the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD Which they do And I have a copy Its in your gift bag No no With your voices on it So some of the stories are just
so classic and yet so understandable A woman called Apple to complain
that her mouse was squeaking Making a squeaking noise And the technician said Well maam what do you mean
your mouse is squeaking She says All I can tell you
is that it squeaks louder the faster I move it across the screen And the technicians like Maam youve got the mouse
up against the screen She goes Well the message said
Click here to continue Well if you like that one 
how much time have we got Another one a guy called 
this is absolutely true  his computer had crashed
and he told the technician he couldnt restart it no matter
how many times he typed  And the technician said
What Why are you typing  He said The message says
Error Type  So we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely
at the feet of the users But why is the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerating now In the hardware world its because
we the consumers want everything to be smaller
smaller smaller So the gadgets are getting
tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially
staying the same size So it gets to be more and more
of a challenge Software is subject
to another primal force the mandate to release
more and more versions When you buy a piece of software its not like buying a vase
or a candy bar where you own it Its more like joining a club
where you pay dues every year and every year they say Weve added more features
and well sell it to you for  I know one guy whos spent 
just on Photoshop over the years And software companies make
 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox  which is that if you improve
a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it I mean Microsoft Word was last
just a word processor in you know the Eisenhower administration But whats the alternative Microsoft actually did this experiment They said Well wait a minute Everyone complains that
were adding so many features Lets create a word processor
thats just a word processor Simple pure does not do web pages
is not a database And it came out
and it was called Microsoft Write And none of you are nodding
in acknowledgment because it died It tanked No one ever bought it I call this the Sport Utility Principle People like to surround themselves
with unnecessary power right They dont need the database
and the website but theyre like Well Ill upgrade because I might
you know I might need that someday So the problem is as you add more
features where are they going to go Where are you going to stick them
You only have so many design tools You can do buttons you can do
sliders popup menus submenus But if youre not careful
about how you choose you wind up with this This is an unretouched 
this is not a joke  unretouched photo of Microsoft Word the copy that you have
with all the toolbars open Youve obviously never
opened all the toolbars but all you have to type in
is this little teeny window down here And weve arrived at the age
of interface matrices where there are so many
features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word
is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically The off switch is in there somewhere Im telling you  its there Part of the art of designing
a simple good interface is knowing when to use
which one of these features So here is the logoff
dialogue box for Windows  There are only four choices so why are they in a popup menu Its not like the rest of the screen
is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices They could have put them all out in view Heres Apples take
on the exact same dialogue box Thank you  yes I designed
the dialogue box No no Already we can see
that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent
approach to software design Microsofts approach
to simplicity tends to be lets break it down
lets just make it more steps There are these wizards everywhere And you know theres a new version
of Windows coming out this fall If they continue at this pace
theres absolutely no telling where they might wind up Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Ok Ill bite Lets click Next to continue From the dropdown menu choose
the first letter you want to type Ok So there is a limit
that we dont want to cross So what is the answer How do you pack in all these features
in a simple intelligent way I believe in consistency when possible realworld equivalents trash can folder when possible
label things mostly But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules
if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence Now what do I mean by that Im going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something
not consistent but its better If you are buying something on the web youre supposed to put in your address and youre supposed to choose
what country youre from ok There are  countries in the world We like to think of the Internet
as a global village Im sorry its not one yet Its mainly like the United States
Europe and Japan So why is United States in the Us You have to scroll like
seven screensful to get to it Now it would be inconsistent
to put United States first but it would be intelligent This ones been touched on before but why in Gods name do you
shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called Start Heres another pet one of mine
you have a printer Most of the time you want to print
one copy of your document in page order on that printer So why in Gods name do you see
this every time you print Its like a  shuttle cockpit And one of the buttons at the bottom
youll notice is not Print Now Im not saying that Apple
is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity Palm is also especially in the old days
wonderful about this I actually got to speak to Palm
when they were flying high in the s and after the talk
I met one of the employees He says Nice talk And I said
Thank you What do you do here He said Im a tap counter
Im like Youre a what He goes Well Jeff Hawkins
the CEO says If any task on the Palm Pilot
takes more than three taps of the stylus its too long
and it has to be redesigned So Im the tap counter So Im going to show you an example of a company that does not
have a tap counter This is Microsoft Word Ok when you want to create
a new blank document in Word  it could happen You go up to the File menu
and you choose New Now what happens when you choose New Do you get a new blank document You do not On the opposite side of the monitor
a task bar appears and somewhere in those links 
by the way not at the top  somewhere in those links is a button
that makes you a new document Ok so that is a company
not counting taps You know I dont want to just stand
here and make fun of Microsoft  Yes I do The Bill Gates song Piano music Ive been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS I put my software and IBM together I got profit and they got the loss I write the code
that makes the whole world run Im getting royalties from everyone Sometimes its garbage
but the press is snowed You buy the box Ill sell the code Every software company
is doing Microsofts RampD You cant keep a good idea
down these days Even Windows is a hack Were kind of based loosely on the Mac So its big so its slow
Youve got nowhere to go Im not doing this for praise I write the code
that fits the world today Big mediocrity in every way Weve entered planet domination mode Youll have no choice youll buy my code I am Bill Gates and I write the code But actually I believe
there are really two Microsofts Theres the old one responsible
for Windows and Office Theyre dying to throw the whole thing
out and start fresh but they cant Theyre locked in because so many addons
and other company stuff locks into the old  chassis But theres also a new Microsoft thats really doing good
simple interface designs I liked the Media Center PC I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch The Wireless Watch
flopped miserably in the market but it wasnt because it wasnt
simply and beautifully designed But lets put it this way would you pay  a month to have a watch that has to be recharged
every night like your cell phone and stops working
when you leave your area code So the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch
is only going to get worse So is there any hope The screens are getting smaller
people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes things are coming out at a faster pace Its funny  when Steve Jobs
came back to Apple in  after  years away
it was the MacWorld Expo  he came to the stage
in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of did this The crowd went wild
but I had just seen  Im like where have I seen this before I had just seen the movie Evita  with Madonna and Im like you know what Ive got to do one about Steve Jobs Music It wont be easy
Youll think Im strange When I try to explain why Im back after telling the press
Apples future is black You wont believe me All that you see is a kid in his teens
who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz You try rhyming with garage Dont cry for me Cupertino The truth is I never left you I know the ropes now
know what the tricks are I made a fortune over at Pixar Dont cry for me Cupertino Ive still got the drive and vision I still wear sandals in any weather Its just that these days theyre Gucci leather Thank you So Steve Jobs had always believed
in simplicity and elegance and beauty And the truth is for years I was a little depressed because Americans
obviously did not value it because the Mac had
three percent market share Windows had  percent market share  people did not think it was worth
putting a price on it So I was a little depressed And then I heard Al Gores talk and I realized I didnt know
the meaning of depressed But it turns out I was wrong right Because the iPod came out and it violated every bit
of common wisdom Other products cost less
other products had more features they had voice recorders
and FM transmitters The other products were backed
by Microsoft with an open standard not Apples propriety standard But the iPod won 
this is the one they wanted The lesson was simplicity sells And there are signs that the industry
is getting the message This is a little company thats done
very well with simplicity and elegance The Sonos thing  its catching on Ive got just a couple examples Physically a really cool
elegant thinking coming along lately When you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures
back to your computer Well you either haul around a USB cable or you buy a card reader
and haul that around Either one youre going to lose What I do is I take out the memory card and I fold it in half
revealing USB contacts I just stick it in the computer
offload the pictures put it right back in the camera I never have to lose anything Heres another example Chris youre the source of all power
Will you be my power plug Chris Anderson Oh yeah
DP Hold that and dont let go You mightve seen this
this is Apples new laptop This the power cord
It hooks on like this And Im sure every one of you has done
this at some point in your lives or one of your children You walk along  and Im
about to pull this onto the floor I dont care Its a loaner Here we go Whoa Its magnetic  it doesnt pull
the laptop onto the floor In my very last example  I do a lot of my work
using speech recognition software And Ill just 
you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous Speech recognition
software is really great for doing emails very quickly period Like I get hundreds of them
a day period And its not just what I dictate
that it writes down period I also use this feature
called voice macros period Correct dissuade Not just Ok this is not an ideal situation because its getting the echo
from the hall and stuff The point is I can respond to people
very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out
a much longer thing So if somebody
sends me a fan letter Ill say Thanks for that Thank you so much
for taking the time to write  And conversely if somebody
sends me hate mail  which happens daily  I say Piss off I admire your frankness  So thats my dirty little secret
Dont tell anyone So the point is 
this is a really interesting story This is version eight of this software and do you know what they put
in version eight No new features Its never
happened before in software The company put no new features They just said Well make
this software work right Right Because for years people had bought
this software tried it out   percent accuracy was all they got which means one in  words is wrong  and theyd put it in their drawer And the company got sick of that so they said This version
were not going to do anything but make sure its darned accurate And so thats what they did This cult of doing things right
is starting to spread So my final advice for those of you
who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesnt work
its not necessarily you ok It could be the design
of the thing youre using Be aware in life
of good design and bad design And if youre among the people
who create this stuff Easy is hard Presweat the details for your audience Count the taps Remember the hard part
is not deciding what features to add its deciding what to leave out And best of all your motivation is
simplicity sells CA Bravo DP Thank you very much CA Hear hear ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

8,Kurt Andersen Like many architects David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent  or at least pretends to be  that he asked me to question him rather than speaking In fact what were going to talk about I think is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede Dan Rather Since the September th attack on the World Trade Center many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the acre burial ground Now as CBSs Jim Axelrod reports theyre putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene Jim Axelrod Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty Theres a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest  Ground Zero Tourist Ive taken my stepdaughter here from Indianapolis This was  out of all the tourist sites in New York City  this was her numberone pick JA Thousands now line up on lower Broadway Tourist Ive been wanting to come down here since this happened JA Even on the coldest winter days To honor and remember Tourist Its reality its us It happened here This is ours JA So many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem Tourist I think that people are very frustrated that theyre not able to get closer to see whats going on JA But that is about to change In record time a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer Man Theyll get an incredible panorama and understand I think more completely the sheer totality of the destruction of the place JA If you think about it Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument people come here to see whats no longer there David Rockwell The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground JA The walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter Tourist From our hearts it affected us just as much JA The ramps are made of simple material  the kind of plywood you see at construction sites  which is really the whole point In the face of Americas worst destruction people are building again Jim Axelrod CBS News New York KA This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment but certainly David you are known as  I know a phrase you hate  an entertainment architect Your work is highly sensual even hedonistic DR I like that word KA Its about pleasure  casinos and hotels and restaurants How did the shock that all of us  and especially all of us in New York  felt on the th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing DR Well the truth of the matter is postSeptember th I felt myself in the role originally  first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated and as someone who works less than a mile from there  that I was in the role of forcing  people who work with me in my firm to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating In fact were finishing a book which is called Pleasure which is about sensual pleasure in spaces But Ive got to tell you  it became impossible to do that We were really paralyzed And I found myself the Friday after September th  two days afterwards  literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything We gave the office a few days off And in discussing this with other architects we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were  they should rebuild them  stories taller And I thought it was astonishing to speculate as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound And I had a series of discussions  first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller who collaborated with us on this and several other people  and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something And that as people who create places the ultimate way to help wasnt to pontificate or to make up scenarios but to help right now So we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design SWAT team And that was the mission that we came up with KA Were you conscious of suddenly  as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants  suddenly fulfilling needs DR Well what I was aware of was there was this overwhelming need to act now And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this There was a school PS  that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero They moved to an abandoned school We took about  or  architects and designers and artists and over four days  it was like this urban barnraising  to renovate it and everyone wanted to help It was just extraordinary Tom Otterness contributed Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us KA And that was done effectively by October  or something DR Yeah KA Obviously what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project  and this is only one of four that youve designed to surround the site  you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics DR Well its a funny thing We finished PS  and had dinner with a small group I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild And I sat in on several meetings And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with longterm infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process And it wasnt an inclusive group So we said what is  KA It was not an inclusive group DR It was not an inclusive group It was predominantly a white rich corporate group that was not representative of the city KA Shocking DR Yeah surprising So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea The city actually approached us We first approached the city about Pier  We saw how PS  worked The families  the victims of the families  were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing KA On the Hudson River DR Yeah And the city actually  through Tim Zagat initially and then through Christyne Nicholas then we got to Giuliani  said You know we dont want to do anything with Pier  right now but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that wed like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin and Ive got to say it was the most moving experience of my life It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them And there was no mediation between us and the experience There was no filter And I remembered on September th on th Street the roof of our building  we can see the World Trade Towers prominently  and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up And then everyone was up on the roof so I ran up there And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience So seeing this in a very simple dignified way was a very powerful experience So we went back to the city and said were not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform but weve spent some time down there At the same time the city had this need They were looking for a solution to deal with  or  thousand people a day who were going down there that had nowhere to go And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan There was a way  there had to be a way  to get people to move around the site KA But then youve got to figure out a way  we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board  but simply funding this thing It looks like a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar project DR Well we knew that if it wasnt privately funded it wasnt going to happen And we also frankly knew that if it didnt happen by the end of the Giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the  we were meeting with  or  people with the city at a time and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management This incredible act on their part because they really wanted this and they sensed that this needed to happen KA And there was therefore this ticking clock because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that DR Yeah So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this  we had to work with the families of the victims through the city to make sure that they knew this was happening Because this didnt want to be a surprise And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to do this even if we would pay him the money There needed to be a foundation in place So we came up with a foundation and actually what happened was one major developer in New York  KA Who shall remain nameless I guess DR Yeah His initials are JS and he owns Rockefeller Center if that helps anyone  volunteered to help And we met with him The prices from the contractors were between five to  dollars And AtlanticHeydt whos the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost So this developer said You know what well underwrite the entire expense And we said Thats incredible And I think this was the st and we knew this had to be built and up by the th And we had to start construction the next day We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it KA Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge I guess DR In fact it was as if this was going to be windowwashing scaffolding There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul  that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified and a place to reflect and remember And Ive got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul  which is just to the right  and moving around the site And I live down there so we spent a lot of time looking at the need And I think people were amazed at two things  I think they were amazed at the destruction but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said Im going to lock the door because this developer will not agree to have you leave till youve signed off on this And we said Well this is half the size it doesnt have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone  everyone in the city Wed have to go back to the beginning to do this And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding So we didnt know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net We emailed out letters to as many people as we could  several people in the audience here  who were very helpful KA There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point DR No In fact I told the contractor to go ahead He had already ordered materials based on my goahead We knew that one way or another this was going to happen And we just felt it had to happen KA You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation Richard I think very correctly made the point at the beginning  before all the chair designers came out  about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal banal common problem of sitting It seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that This was an unprecedented singular design problem DR Well heres the issue we knew that this was not in the sense of  we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial That this was a place for people to reflect to remember  a kind of quiet place So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer  as we said about the families platform  and the experience as possible Its all incredibly humble material Its scaffolding and plywood And it allows  by sort of the procession of the movement up by Saint Pauls and down the other side  it gives you about  feet to go up  feet from the ground to where you get the  degree view But the design was driven by a need to be quick cheap safe respectful flexible One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site one of which is an upgrade of the families platform we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is KA Your work  I mean weve talked about this before  a lot of your work I think is informed by your belief in or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die sort of sense of existence This is clearly not a work for the ages You know a couple of years this thing isnt going to be here Did that require as an architect a new way of thinking about what you were doing To think of it as this purely temporary installation DR No I dont think so I think this is obviously substantially different from anything wed ever thought about doing before just by the nature of it Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is number one  the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done And Kevin Kennon Rick Scofidio Liz Diller and all the people within the city  Norman Lear who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it So the notion of collaboration  I think this reinforces how important that is And in terms of the temporary nature of it our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about whats really happening there And a day or two before it opened was Giulianis farewell address where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial Which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter I think makes it a more powerful dialogue And thats what we were interested in So that very much is in the realm of things Ive been interested in before KA It seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure It enables that conversation to get serious And six months after the fact  and only a few months away from the site being cleaned  we are very quickly now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious Do you have  having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project  have any ideas about what should or shouldnt be done DR Well I think one thing that shouldnt be done is evaluate  I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings KA But it had some really terrible ideas DR And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses And I think there should be a broader  which theres starting to be  the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that its going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion Theres a few discussions right now that I think are very positive about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over so that theres one uninterrupted piece of land KA Well I think thats interesting And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago but perhaps isnt now which is not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza Is this an opportunity is the silver lining  a silver lining here  to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not DR I think theres a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day I dont think it has much to do with  or  or  or  thousand new office spaces regardless of what the number is So yeah I think there is a chance to relook at how we think about cities And in fact theres a proposal on the table now for building number seven KA Which was the building just north of the Towers DR Right which the towers fell into And the reason thats been held up is essentially by community outrage that theyre not reopening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city I think a public dialogue  I think you know Id like to see an international competition and a call for ideas for uses KA Whether its arts whether its housing whether its what amount of shopping DR Right And were looking for other things This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting  architects who currently dont have a voice in New York to do artist housing And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about a multiplicity of things KA Before we end I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform DR John Kamen  whos here actually  put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use So I thought that would be good to end with DR Were looking from Fulton Street west One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how antigraffiti he was And essentially our structure was designed to be written on KA As you say its not a memorial But were you conscious of memorials The Vietnam Memorial Those kinds of forms DR We certainly did as much research as we could and we were conscious of other memorials And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do Its  people on the committee for Oklahoma City which is why we thought of this as a sort of adhoc spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were adhoc memorials in the city already The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is demountable Whats interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed so that what youre aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero but all of the buildings around it  and the scars on the building around it which are enormous This shows Saint Pauls on the left KA I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished is part of its extraordinary  I dont know if beauty is the word  but presence DR It was an honor to do And we were thrilled to be able to show it here ,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

9,As you pointed out every time you come here you learn something This morning the worlds experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats I think concluded that ultimately the solution is people shouldnt sit down I could have told them that Yesterday the automotive guys gave us some new insights They pointed out that I believe it was between  and  years from today they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff Thats reassuring They then pointed out that thered be sort of the other controls by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff Thats pretty good but why not get rid of the wires Then you dont need anything to control the car except thinking about it I would love to talk about the technology and sometime in whats past the  minutes Ill be happy to talk to all the technogeeks around here about whats in here But if I had one thing to say about this before we get to first it would be that from the time we started building this the big idea wasnt the technology It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community The big idea here is I think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation And maybe to put that in perspective theres so much data on this Ill be happy to give it to you in different forms You never know what strikes the fancy of whom but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world And Henry Ford just about  years ago started cranking out Model Ts What I dont think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied For instance in that time  percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns So the car  the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage  was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage It was half as long And it was an environmental improvement because for instance in  they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm or their farm to a town or from a town to a city It all made sense with  percent of the people living there By the s we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world the highway system And it is certainly a wonder And by the way as I take shots at old technologies I want to assure everybody and particularly the automotive industry  whos been very supportive of us  that I dont think this in any way competes with airplanes or cars But think about where the world is today  percent of the global population now lives in cities Thats  billion people Weve solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today  years ago sailing ships started getting reliable enough we found a new continent  years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country Over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the  years weve connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that But during that entire process more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving to cities China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half And so nobody I think would argue that airplanes in the last  years have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood And if you just look at how technology has been applied weve solved all the longrange highspeed highvolume largeweight problems of moving things around Nobody would want to give them up And I certainly wouldnt want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my Humvee or my Porsche I love them all I dont keep any of them in my living room The fact is the last mile is the problem and half the world now lives in dense cities And people spend depending on who they are between  and  percent of their energy getting around on foot I think theres  I dont know what data would impress you but how about  percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices particularly sitting in cities And again I say that not to attack any industry I think  I really do  I love my airplane and cars on highways moving  miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient both from an engineering point of view an energy consumption point of view and a utility point of view And we all love our cars and I do The problem is you get into the city and you want to go four blocks its neither fun nor efficient nor productive Its not sustainable If  in China in the year   million people used bicycles  million people used cars If five percent of that population became quote middle class and wanted to go the way weve gone in the last hundred years at the same time that  percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan every six weeks  it isnt sustainable environmentally it isnt sustainable economically  there just aint enough oil  and its not sustainable politically I mean what are we fighting over right now We can make it complicated but whats the world fighting over right now So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile and it was dumb luck We were working on iBOTs but once we made this we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis You dont need the water Or snowmobiles You dont need the snow Or skiing Its just fun and people love to move around doing fun things And every one of those industries by the way  just golf carts alone is a multibilliondollar industry But rather than go license this off which is what we normally do it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology but into an understanding of a world thats solved all its other problems but has somehow come to accept that cities  which right back from ancient Greece on were meant to walk around cities that were architected and built for people  now have a footprint that while weve solved every other transportation problem  and its like Moores law I mean look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon then on a railroad then an airplane Every other form of transportations been improved In  years weve gone backwards in getting around cities Theyve gotten bigger theyre spread out The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city  Wilshire Boulevard or Fifth Avenue or Tokyo or Paris  the most expensive real estate is their downtowns  percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars The  largest cities in the world So you wonder what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities What if you could make them fun attractive clean environmentally friendly What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this as that last link to mass transit to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want and then have our cities energized again We thought it would be really neat to do that and one of the problems we really were worried about is how do we get legal on the sidewalk Because technically Ive got motors Ive got wheels  Im a motor vehicle I dont look like a motor vehicle I have the same footprint as a pedestrian I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space I took this down to Ground Zero and knocked my way through crowds for an hour Im a pedestrian But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and if we get told we dont belong on the sidewalk we have two choices Were a recreational vehicle that doesnt really matter and I dont spend my time doing that kind of stuff Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle Weve been so concerned about that we went to the Postmaster General of the United States as the first person we ever showed on the outside and said Put your people on it Everybody trusts their postman And they belong on the sidewalks and theyll use it seriously He agreed We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat carrying  pounds of stuff They love it And I cant believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket So weve been working really really hard but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about whats important and how to apply the technology We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted So Im happy really I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want And yes its really fun and yes you should all go out and try it But if I could ask you to do one thing its not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine that although we all understand somehow that its reasonable that we use our pound machine which can go  miles an hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow its also what we used for the last mile and its broken and it doesnt work One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted happened out here in California A few weeks ago after we launched it we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach zipping up and back and hes marveling at the technology and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by and skateboarders are zipping by and a little old lady  I mean if you looked in the dictionary a little old lady  came by me  and now that Im on this Im the height of a normal adult now  and she just stops and the camera is there and she looks up at me and says Can I try that And what was I  you know how are you going to say anything And so I said Sure So I get off and she gets on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turns around and she goes about  feet and she turns back around and shes all smiles And she comes back to me and she stops and she says Finally they made something for us And the camera is looking down at her Im thinking Wow that was great   please lady dont say another word And the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said What do you mean by that And I figured Its all over now and she looks up and she says Well shes still watching these guys go she says I cant ride a bike no she says I cant use a skateboard and Ive never used roller blades she knew them by name she says And its been  years since I rode a bicycle Then she looks up shes looking up and she says And Im  years old and I dont drive a car anymore I still have to get to the store and I cant carry a lot of things And it suddenly occurred to me that among my many fears were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it  it was that fundamentally you believe theres pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left the sidewalks in these cities When you look at the  inches of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the parked car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet  its  that little piece is all thats there But she looks up and says this and it occurs to me well kids arent going to mind these things and they dont vote and business people and then young adults arent going to mind these things  theyre pretty cool  so I guess subliminally I was worried that its the older population thats going to worry So having seen this and having worried about it for eight years the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys call AARP get an appointment right away Weve got to show them this thing And they took it to Washington they showed them and theyre going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities like Atlanta where were doing trials to see if it really can in fact help reenergize their downtown The bottom line is whether you believe the United Nations or any of the other think tanks  in the next  years all human population growth on this planet will be in cities In Asia alone it will be over a billion people They learned to start with cell phones They didnt have to take the year trip we took They start at the top of the technology food chain Weve got to start building cities and human environments where a pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense rich greenspace environment without being in a pound machine to do it Cars were not meant for parallel parking theyre wonderful machines to go between cities but just think about it weve solved all the longrange highspeed problems The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals You do it in your sneakers Not much has changed If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking  three times  a minute walk becomes  minutes Your choice when living in a city if its now  minutes  because at  minutes you want an alternative whether its a bus a train  weve got to build an infrastructure  a light rail  or youre going to keep parking those cars But if you could put a pin in most cities and imagine how far you could if you had the time walk in one halfhour its the city If you could make it fun and make it eight or  minutes you cant find your car unpark your car move your car repark your car and go somewhere you cant get to a cab or a subway We could change the way people allocate their resources the way this planet uses its energy make it more fun And were hoping to some extent history will say we were right Thats Segway This is a Stirling cycle engine this had been confused by a lot of things were doing This little beast right now is producing a few hundred watts of electricity Yes it could be attached to this and yes on a kilogram of propane you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is itll burn any fuel because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact where most of the world you cant simply plug into your volt outlet Weve been working on this actually as an alternative energy source starting way back with Johnson amp Johnson to run an iBOT because the best batteries you could get   watthours per kilogram in lead  watthours per kilogram nickelcadmium  watthours per kilogram in nickelmetal hydride  watthours per kilogram in lithium  watthours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline  which is why nobody drives electric cars But in any event if you can burn it with the same efficiency  because its external combustion  as your kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turns out to be pretty neat It makes just enough electricity to for instance do this which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as Mr Holly  Dr Holly  pointed out can run computers and a light bulb But more interestingly the thermodynamics of this say youre never going to get more than  percent efficiency It doesnt matter much  it says if you get  watts of electricity youll get  or  watts of heat If you wanted to boil water and recondense it at a rate of  gallons an hour it takes about  a little over  kilowatt   watts of continuous power  to do it Thats so much energy you couldnt afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way Certainly in the rest of the world your choice is to devastate the place turning everything that will burn into heat or drink the water thats available The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water Depending on whose numbers you believe its between  and  people per day We dont need sophisticated heart transplants around the world We need water And women shouldnt have to spend four hours a day looking for it or watching their kids die We figured out how to put a vaporcompression distiller on this thing with a counterflow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for  watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat it will make  gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it So if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a solution to transportation electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs  pounds I dont know but well try it I better shut up

10,"With all the legitimate concerns
about AIDS and avian flu  and well hear about that from the brilliant Dr Brilliant later today  I want to talk about the other
pandemic which is cardiovascular disease
diabetes hypertension  all of which are completely
preventable for at least  percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle And whats happening is that theres a globalization of illness
occurring that people are starting to eat like us
and live like us and die like us And
in one generation for example Asias gone from having
one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity
and diabetes to one of the highest And in Africa
cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries So theres a critical
window of opportunity we have to make an important
difference that can affect the lives of literally
millions of people and practice preventive
medicine on a global scale Heart and blood vessel
diseases still kill more people  not only in this
country but also worldwide  than everything
else combined and yet its completely preventable
for almost everybody Its not only preventable its actually reversible And for the last
almost  years weve been able to show
that by simply changing diet and lifestyle using
these very hightech expensive stateoftheart
measures to prove how powerful these very simple
and lowtech and lowcost interventions can be like  quantitative arteriography
before and after a year and cardiac PET scans We showed a few months
ago  we published the first study showing you
can actually stop or reverse the progression
of prostate cancer by making changes in diet
and lifestyle and  percent regression in the tumor
growth or inhibition of the tumor growth compared
to only nine percent in the control group And in the MRI and MR
spectroscopy here the prostate tumor activity
is shown in red  you can see it diminishing after a year Now there is an epidemic
of obesity twothirds of adults and  percent of kids
Whats really concerning to me is that diabetes has
increased  percent in the past  years and this may be the first generation in which our kids
live a shorter life span than we do Thats pitiful and its preventable Now these are not election
returns these are the people  the number
of the people who are obese by state beginning in 
   these are from the CDC website 
     you get a new category 
         
 it gets worse Were kind of devolving Laughter Now what can we do about this
Well you know the diet that weve found
that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet But the people in Asia
are starting to eat like we are which is why theyre
starting to get sick like we are So Ive been working
with a lot of the big food companies They can make
it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient
to eat healthier foods like  I chair the advisory
boards to McDonalds and PepsiCo and ConAgra
and Safeway and soon Del Monte and theyre
finding that its good business The salads that you see
at McDonalds came from the work  theyre going
to have an Asian salad At Pepsi twothirds
of their revenue growth came from their better foods And so if we can do that
then we can free up resources for buying drugs
that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV
and malaria and for preventing avian flu Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

11,Good morning everyone First of all its been fantastic being here over these past few days And secondly I feel its a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people these amazing talks that weve had I feel that Ive fitted in in many ways to some of the things that Ive heard I came directly here from the deep deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador where I was out  you could only get there by a plane  with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies and keep the roads out of their forests Theyre fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world thats clean a world that isnt contaminated a world that isnt polluted And what was so amazing to me and what fits right in with what were all talking about here at TED is that there right in the middle of this rainforest was some solar panels  the first in that part of Ecuador  and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldnt have to go down The water was cleaned but because they got a lot of batteries they were able to store a lot of electricity So every house  and there were I think eight houses in this little community  could have light for I think it was about half an hour each evening And there is the Chief in all his regal finery with a laptop computer And this man he has been outside but hes gone back and he was saying You know we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era and we didnt even know about the white man  years ago and now here we are with laptop computers and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world We want to know about health care We want to know about what other people do  were interested in it And we want to learn other languages We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese and were good at languages So there he is with his little laptop computer but fighting against the might of the pressures  because of the debt the foreign debt of Ecuador  fighting the pressure of World Bank IMF and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil And so coming directly from there to here But of course my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization  I cant really call it a civilization A different way of life a different being Weve talked earlier  this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world  but the world is not composed only of human beings there are also other animal beings And I propose to bring into this TED conference as I always do around the world the voice of the animal kingdom Too often we just see a few slides or a bit of film but these beings have voices that mean something And so I want to give you a greeting as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ive been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since  During that time there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work For example for the first time a few years ago by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed  to have DNA profiling done  so for the first time we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society So this opens up a whole new avenue of research And we use GSI  geographic whatever it is GSI  to determine the range of the chimps And were using  you can see that Im not really into this kind of stuff  but were using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area And of course theres developments in infrared so you can watch animals at night and equipment for recording by video and tape recording is getting lighter and better So in many many ways we can do things today that we couldnt do when I began in  Especially when chimpanzees and other animals with large brains are studied in captivity modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these nonhuman animals So that we know today theyre capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan  her name means love  and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her She loves her computer  shell leave her big group and her running water and her trees and everything And shell come in to sit at this computer  its like a video game for a kid shes hooked Shes  by the way and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans She does very complex tasks and I havent got time to go into them but the amazing thing about this female is she doesnt like making mistakes If she has a bad run and her score isnt good shell come and reach up and tap on the glass  because she cant see the experimenter  which is asking to have another go And her concentration  shes already concentrated hard for  minutes or so and now she wants to do it all over again just for the satisfaction of having done it better And the food is not important  she does get a tiny reward like one raisin for a correct response  but she will do it for nothing if you tell her beforehand So here we are a chimpanzee using a computer Chimpanzees gorillas orangutans also learn human sign language But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in   I remember so well so vividly as though it was yesterday  the first time when I was going through the vegetation the chimpanzees were still running away from me for the most part although some were a little bit acclimatized  and I saw this dark shape hunched over a termite mound and I peered with my binoculars It was fortunately one adult male whom Id named David Greybeard  and by the way science at that time was telling me that I shouldnt name the chimps they should all have numbers that was more scientific Anyway David Greybeard  and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest And not only that  he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves  modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose  the beginning of toolmaking The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time it was thought that humans and only humans used and made tools When I was at school we were defined as man the toolmaker So that when Louis Leakey my mentor heard this news he said Ah we must now redefine man redefine tool or accept chimpanzees as humans We now know that at Gombe alone there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes Moreover we know that in different parts of Africa wherever chimps have been studied there are completely different toolusing behaviors And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next through observation imitation and practice  that is a definition of human culture What we find is that over these odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes and as I say other mammals with complex brains and social systems we have found that after all there isnt a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom Its a very wuzzy line Its getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we in our arrogance used to think was just human The chimps  theres no time to discuss their fascinating lives  but they have this long childhood five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother and then another three four or five years of emotional dependence on her even when the next child is born The importance of learning in that time when behavior is flexible  and theres an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society The longterm affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother with the brothers and sisters and which can last through a lifetime which may be up to  years They can actually live longer than  in captivity so weve only done  years in the wild so far And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism We find in their nonverbal communication  this is very rich  they have a lot of sounds which they use in different circumstances but they also use touch posture gesture and what do they do They kiss they embrace they hold hands They pat one another on the back they swagger they shake their fist  the kind of things that we do and they do them in the same kind of context They have very sophisticated cooperation Sometimes they hunt  not that often but when they hunt they show sophisticated cooperation and they share the prey We find that they show emotions similar to  maybe sometimes the same  as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness sadness fear despair They know mental as well as physical suffering And I dont have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you save to say that there are very bright students in the best universities studying emotions in animals studying personalities in animals We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors  self as opposed to other They have a sense of humor and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives But this teaches us a new respect  and its a new respect not only for the chimpanzees I suggest but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet Once were prepared to admit that after all were not the only beings with personalities minds and above all feelings and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient sapient creatures on this planet it really gives cause for deep shame at least for me So the sad thing is that these chimpanzees  whove perhaps taught us more than any other creature a little humility  are in the wild disappearing very fast Theyre disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well The deforestation the growth of human populations needing more land Theyre disappearing because some timber companies go in with clearcutting Theyre disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads  as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched  to take out oil or timber And this has led in Congo basin and other parts of the world to what is known as the bushmeat trade This means that although for hundreds perhaps thousands of years people have lived in those forests or whatever habitat it is in harmony with their world just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families  now suddenly because of the roads the hunters can go in from the towns They shoot everything every single thing that moves thats bigger than a small rat they sundry it or smoke it And now theyve got transport they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it And people will pay more for bushmeat as its called than for domestic meat  its culturally preferred And its not sustainable and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin whove lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted Theyre given weapons they shoot for the logging camps they get money Their culture is being destroyed along with the animals upon whom they depend So when the logging camp moves theres nothing left We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity and Ive seen it happening with my own eyes And the grim picture in Africa  I love Africa and what do we see in Africa We see deforestation we see the desert spreading we see massive hunger we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support and theyre too poor to buy food from elsewhere Were the people that we heard about yesterday on the Easter Island who cut down their last tree  were they stupid Didnt they know what was happening Of course but if youve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isnt a question of Lets leave the tree for tomorrow How am I going to feed my family today Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer and then well pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end So this is a pretty grim picture The one thing we have which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures is this sophisticated spoken language  a language with which we can tell children about things that arent here We can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future discuss ideas with each other so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group We can do it by talking to each other we can do it through video we can do it through the written word And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards and were destroying the world In the developed world in a way its worse because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what were doing Do you know were bringing little babies into a world where in many places the water is poisoning them And the air is harming them and the food thats grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them And thats not just in the faraway developing world thats everywhere Do you know we all have about  chemicals in our bodies we didnt have about  years ago And so many of these diseases like asthma and certain kinds of cancers are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped Were harming ourselves around the world as well as harming the animals as well as harming nature herself  Mother Nature that brought us into being Mother Nature where I believe we need to spend time where theres trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development And yet there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature because theyre growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun or in the forest with the dappled sunspecks coming down from the canopy above As I was traveling around the world you know I had to leave the forest  thats where I love to be I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because finding they dwindled from about two million  years ago to about  now I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world And the more I talked about the chimpanzees plight the more I realized the fact that everythings interconnected and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world and everything was joining together and making  not sense hope lies in sense you said  its making a nonsense How can we do it Somebody said that yesterday And as I was traveling around I kept meeting young people whod lost hope They were feeling despair they were feeling Well it doesnt matter what we do eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die Everything is hopeless  were always being told so by the media And then I met some who were angry and anger that can turn to violence and were all familiar with that And I have three little grandchildren and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university theyd say Were angry or Were filled with despair because we feel youve compromised our future and theres nothing we can do about it And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren and think how much weve harmed this planet since I was their age I feel this deep shame and thats why in  in Tanzania I started a program thats called Roots and Shoots Theres little brochures all around outside and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future I beg that you pick up that brochure And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope Roots make a firm foundation Shoots seem tiny but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls See the brick walls as all the problems that weve inflicted on this planet Then you see it is a message of hope Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference Every individual has a role to play Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday and you scientists know that you cant actually  even if you stay in bed all day youre breathing oxygen and giving out CO and probably going to the loo and things like that  youre making a difference in the world So the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects And these are projects to make the world around them a better place One project to show care and concern for your own human community One for animals including domestic animals  and I have to say I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog Rusty who was my childhood companion And the third kind of project something for the local environment So what the kids do depends first of all how old are they  and we go now from preschool right through university Its going to depend whether theyre innercity or rural Its going to depend if theyre wealthy or impoverished Its going to depend which part say of America theyre in Were in every state now and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York Its going to depend on which country theyre in  and were already in plus countries with about  active groups  and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that Ive never even heard of because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves Why Because theyre buying into it and theyre the ones who get to decide what theyre going to do It isnt something that their parents tell them or their teachers tell them Thats effective but if they decide themselves We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories We want to go and work in a dog shelter We want to learn about animals We want   You know it goes on and on and this is very hopeful for me As I travel around the world  days a year everywhere theres a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying Look at the difference weve made And now comes the technology into it because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world And if anyone is interested to help us weve got so many ideas but we need help  we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement But also  and this is so important  to communicate their despair to say Weve tried this and it doesnt work and what shall we do And then lo and behold theres another group answering these kids who may be in America or maybe this is a group in Israel saying Yeah you did it a little bit wrong This is how you should do it The philosophy is very simple We do not believe in violence No violence no bombs no guns Thats not the way to solve problems Violence leads to violence at least in my view So how do we solve The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding Know the facts but see how they fit in the big picture Hard work and persistence dont give up  and love and compassion leading to respect for all life How many more minutes Two one Chris Anderson One  one to two Jane Goodall Two two Im going to take two Are you going to come and drag me off Anyway  so basically Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young peoples lives Its what Im devoting most of my energy to And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact not just because you can share technology with us but because so many of you have children And if you take this program out and give it to your children they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good because theyve got parents like you And its been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place Its very encouraging But the kids do ask me  and this wont take more than two minutes I promise  the kids say Dr Jane do you really have hope for the future You travel you see all these horrible things happening Firstly the human brain  I dont need to say anything about that Now that we know what the problems are around the world human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems And weve talked a lot about that Secondly the resilience of nature We can destroy a river and we can bring it back to life We can see a whole area desolated and it can be brought back to bloom again with time or a little help And thirdly the last speaker talked about  or the speaker before last talked about the indomitable human spirit We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible Nelson Mandela  I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison where he labored for  years and came out with so little bitterness he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath Even after the th of September  and I was in New York and I felt the fear  nevertheless there was so much human courage so much love and so much compassion And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear  the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldnt worry about the environment any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic  and I was trying to encourage them somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi If you look back through human history you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good And just after that a woman brought me this little bell and I want to end on this note She said If youre talking about hope and peace ring this This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine from the killing fields of Pol Pot  one of the most evil regimes in human history  where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled So yes there is hope and where is the hope Is it out there with the politicians Its in our hands Its in your hands and my hands and those of our children Its really up to us Were the ones who can make a difference If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and dont buy the things that are not we can change the world overnight Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

12,Thank you Its really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager Today I want to talk to you about the future but first Im going to tell you a bit about the past My story starts way before I was born My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz the death camp And she was going along the tracks and the tracks split And somehow  we dont really know exactly the whole story  but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp My grandmother survived and married my grandfather They were living in Hungary and my mother was born And when my mother was two years old the Hungarian revolution was raging and they decided to escape Hungary They got on a boat and yet another divergence  the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia They got on and didnt know where they were going and ended up in Canada So to make a long story short they came to Canada My grandmother was a chemist She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto and at  she died of stomach cancer I never met my grandmother but I carry on her name  her exact name Eva Vertes  and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion too I found this passion not far from here actually when I was nine years old My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon And I had never been a reader when I was young  my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys I tried Nancy Drew I tried all that  and I just didnt like reading books And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called The Hot Zone It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus And something about it just kind of drew me towards it There was this big sort of bumpylooking virus on the cover and I just wanted to read it I picked up that book and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur and to actually here where we are today in Monterey I read that book and from when I was reading that book I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine I wanted to be like the explorers Id read about in the book who went into the jungles of Africa went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was So from that moment on I read every medical book I could get my hands on and I just loved it so much I was a passive observer of the medical world It wasnt until I entered high school that I thought Maybe now you know  being a big high school kid  I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world I was  and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab And hardly anyone responded But I mean why would they respond to a yearold anyway And I got to go talk to one professor Dr Jacobs who accepted me into the lab At that time I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology  specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system So I started that and worked in his lab for a year and found the results that I guess youd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals  that it really really impaired the nervous system The spinal cord had breaks The neurons were crossing in every which way And from then I wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment So thats what led me to Alzheimers I started reading about Alzheimers and tried to familiarize myself with the research and at the same time when I was in the  I was reading in the medical library one day and I read this article about something called purine derivatives And they seemed to have cell growthpromoting properties And being naive about the whole field I kind of thought Oh you have cell death in Alzheimers which is causing the memory deficit and then you have this compound  purine derivatives  that are promoting cell growth And so I thought Maybe if it can promote cell growth it can inhibit cell death too And so thats the project that I pursued for that year and its continuing now as well and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately  percent So I presented those results at the International Science Fair which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life And there I was awarded Best in the World in Medicine which allowed me to get in or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world And from then on since I was now in this huge exciting world I wanted to explore it all I wanted it all at once but knew I couldnt really get that And I stumbled across something called cancer stem cells And this is really what I want to talk to you about today  about cancer At first when I heard of cancer stem cells I didnt really know how to put the two together Id heard of stem cells and Id heard of them as the panacea of the future  the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps But Id heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together Last summer I worked at Stanford University doing some research on cancer stem cells And while I was doing this I was reading the cancer literature trying to  again  familiarize myself with this new medical field And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell This fascinated me The more I read the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury If you smoke you damage your lung tissue and then lung cancer arises If you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs And it was really interesting  there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises Because what stem cells are  theyre these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue So if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then its initiating cancer its almost as if this is a repair response And the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged we need to repair the lung And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair  because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue But its almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response but cant quite control it It hasnt yet become finetuned enough to finish what has been initiated So this really really fascinated me And I really think that we cant think about cancer  let alone any disease  in such blackandwhite terms If we eliminate cancer the way were trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation were bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it Its almost as if were getting back to this starting point Were removing the cancer cells but were revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix Shouldnt we think about manipulation rather than elimination If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate  to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue whatever that cancer has been put there to do  it would be a repair process Wed end up better than we were before cancer So this really changed my view of looking at cancer And while I was reading all these articles about cancer it seemed that the articles  a lot of them  focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer  tracking the cancer through the body tracing where it is where it goes But it struck me that Id never heard of cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter And skeletal muscle constitutes  percent of our body or over  percent of our body And so at first I kind of thought Well maybe theres some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesnt get cancer  at least not that I know of So I looked further into it found as many articles as I could and it was amazing  because it turned out that it was very rare Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer and furthermore not only to cancer but of metastases going to skeletal muscle And what metastases are is when the tumor  when a piece  breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ Thats what a metastasis is Its the part of cancer that is the most dangerous If cancer was localized we could likely remove it or somehow  you know its contained Its very contained But once it starts moving throughout the body thats when it becomes deadly So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles but cancer didnt seem to go to skeletal muscle  there seemed to be something here So these articles were saying you know Skeletal  metastasis to skeletal muscle  is very rare But it was left at that No one seemed to be asking why So I decided to ask why At first  the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology and pretty much said Hey it seems like cancer doesnt really go to skeletal muscle Is there a reason for this And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue Meaning that you have muscle cells but theyre not dividing so it doesnt seem like a good target for cancer to hijack But then again this fact that the metastases didnt go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely And furthermore that nervous tissue  brain  gets cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated So I decided to ask why And heres some of I guess my hypotheses that Ill be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami And I guess Ill keep investigating until I get the answers But I know that in science once you get the answers inevitably youre going to have more questions So I guess you could say that Ill probably be doing this for the rest of my life Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle theres a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels And you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases So first of all I thought you know Wouldnt it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle And as well cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow Without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and its not harmful So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this trying to figure out why cancer doesnt go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported  percent of micrometastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy  percent Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle but only  percent of actual metastases  suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels We use skeletal muscles so much Its the one portion of our body  our hearts always beating Were always moving our muscles Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply It needs to be constantly contracting so therefore its almost selfish Its grabbing its blood vessels for itself Therefore when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue it cant get a blood supply and cant grow So this suggests that maybe if there is an antiangiogenic factor in skeletal muscle  or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow  this could be a potential future therapy for cancer And another thing thats really interesting is that theres this whole  the way tumors move throughout the body its a very complex system  and theres something called the chemokine network And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants and theyre the stop and go signals for cancer So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ  a distant organ somewhere in the body  will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesnt express this type of molecules And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle  theres been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured thats what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle And furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured thats what causes chemokines  these signals saying Cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors  it causes them to highly express these chemokines So theres so much interplay here I mean there are so many possibilities for why tumors dont go to skeletal muscle But it seems like by investigating by attacking cancer by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something  theres got to be something  thats making this tissue resistant to tumors And can we utilize  can we take this property this compound this receptor whatever it is thats controlling these antitumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general Now one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer  to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body  is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called MyoD And what MyoD essentially does is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells So this compound MyoD has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells So is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why it seems as if it is so rare Its not harmful it has just repaired the muscle Muscle is constantly being used  constantly being damaged If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way cancer occurred  I mean everybody would have cancer almost And I hate to say that But it seems as though muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury to finetune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish I really believe that the human body is very very smart and we cant counteract something the body is saying to do Its different when a bacteria comes into the body  thats a foreign object  we want that out But when the body is actually initiating a process and were calling it a disease it doesnt seem as though elimination is the right solution So even to go from there its possible although farfetched that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating  for example Alzheimers where the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells  what if we could in the future use cancer A tumor  put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells Thats a very farfetched idea but I really believe that it may be possible These cells are so versatile these cancer cells are so versatile  we just have to manipulate them in the right way And again some of these may be farfetched but I figured if theres anywhere to present farfetched ideas its here at TED so thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

13,Frank Gehry I listened to this scientist this morning Dr Mullis was talking about his experiments and I realized that I almost became a scientist When I was  my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water So I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in And the glass  luckily I turned around  I had it all in my back and I was about  feet away The wall was covered with  I had an explosion Richard Saul Wurman Really FG People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay RSW  huh Laughter Id like to start this session again The gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous Frank Gehry And Frank youve come to a place in your life which is astonishing I mean it is astonishing for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time I mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because its a funny  you know its a strange thought but your building is an icon  you can draw a little picture of that building it can be used in ads  and youve had not rock star status but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life And I know the road was extremely difficult And it didnt seem at least that your sell outs whatever they were were very big You kept moving ahead in a life where youre dependent on working for somebody But thats an interesting thing for a creative person A lot of us work for people were in the hands of other people And thats one of the great dilemmas  were in a creativity session  its one of the great dilemmas in creativity how to do work thats big enough and not sell out And youve achieved that and that makes your win doubly big triply big Its not quite a question but you can comment on it Its a big issue FG Well Ive always just  Ive never really gone out looking for work I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head And when I started out I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff And I realized when Id come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look at me like Id just landed from Mars But I couldnt do anything else That was my response to the people in the time And actually it was responding to clients that I had who didnt have very much money so they couldnt afford very much I think it was circumstantial Until I got to my house where the client was my wife We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like  grand I built a house around it And a few people got excited about it I was visiting with an artist Michael Heizer out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere Hes building this huge concrete place And it was late in the evening Wed had a lot to drink We were standing out in the desert all alone and thinking about my house he said Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent somewhere in  years somebodys going to like it So I thought Yeah thats probably a good idea Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money so the stuff was a little more permanent But I just found out the world aint going to last that long this guy was telling us the other day So where do we go now Back to  everythings so temporary I dont see it the way you characterized it For me every day is a new thing I approach each project with a new insecurity almost like the first project I ever did and I get the sweats I go in and start working Im not sure where Im going  if I knew where I was going I wouldnt do it When I can predict or plan it I dont do it I discard it So I approach it with the same trepidation Obviously over time I have a lot more confidence that its going to be OK I do run a kind of a business  Ive got  people and youve got to pay them so theres a lot of responsibility involved  but the actual work on the project is with I think a healthy insecurity And like the playwright said the other day  I could relate to him youre not sure When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it I saw all the mistakes I saw  They werent mistakes I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it I felt an embarrassment  How could I have done that How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that Its taken several years to now look at it detached and say  as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street and it appears to have a relationship  that I started to like it RSW Whats the status of the New York project FG I dont really know Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me and I thought he was nuts I didnt think he knew what he was doing and he pulled it off So I think hes Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy He gets up there and then he  comes back up Theyre still talking about it September  generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero and Im totally against that I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time RSW The picture on the screen is that Disney FG Yeah RSW How much further along is it than that and when will that be finished FG That will be finished in   September October  and Im hoping Kyu and Herbie and YoYo and all those guys come play with us at that place Luckily today most of the people Im working with are people I really like Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me Hes been a cheerleader for quite a long time There arent many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients If you think about the world and even just in this audience most of us are involved with buildings Nothing that you would call architecture right And so to find one a guy like that you hang on to him Hes become the head of Art Center and theres a building by Craig Ellwood there I knew Craig and respected him They want to add to it and its hard to add to a building like that  its a beautiful minimalist black steel building  and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and its a lot of acreage I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal Alvaro Siza RSW Why did you want that FG I knew youd ask that question It was intuitive Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work and his early work had a resemblance to my early work When I came out of college I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that I tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasnt  I just stopped I mean Charlie Moore did a bunch of it but it didnt feel good to me Siza on the other hand continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didnt pan out I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you Ive done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra who doesnt think architecture is art Did you see that thing RSW No What did he say FG He calls architecture plumbing FG Anyway the Siza thing Its a richer experience It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians  its similar to that I would imagine  where you  huh Audience Liquid architecture FG Liquid architecture Where you  Its like jazz you improvise you work together you play off each other you make something they make something And I think for me its a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city RSW Is it going to be near the current campus Or is it going to be down near  FG No its near the current campus Anyway hes that kind of patron Its not his money of course RSW Whats his schedule on that FG I dont know Whats the schedule Richard Richard Koshalek Unclear starts from  FG  You can come to the opening Ill invite you No but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos right Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment and if you can figure out how to work off each other  if you can get a bunch of people who respect each others work and play off each other you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect Like the Rockefeller Center model which is kind of from another era RSW I found the most remarkable thing My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building you go inside and thered be extraordinary spaces Id seen drawings you had presented here at TED The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city That was the surprise of going across the river of going on the highway around it of walking down the street and finding it That was the real surprise of Bilbao FG But you know Richard most architects when they present their work  most of the people we know you get up and you talk about your work and its almost like you tell everybody youre a good guy by saying Look Im worried about the context Im worried about the city Im worried about my client I worry about budget that Im on time Blah blah blah and all that stuff And its like cleansing yourself so that you can  by saying all that it means your work is good somehow And I think everybody  I mean that should be a matter of fact like gravity Youre not going to defy gravity Youve got to work with the building department If you dont meet the budgets youre not going to get much work If it leaks  Bilbao did not leak I was so proud The MIT project  they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao I met them in Bilbao They came for three days RSW This is the computer building FG Yeah the computer building They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around  I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden you know People put buckets out  I was clean There wasnt a bloody leak in the place it was just fantastic But youve got to  yeah well up until then every building leaked so this  RSW Frank had a sort of  FG Ask Miriam RW  sort of had a fame His fame was built on that in LA for a while FG Youve all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story when the woman called and said Mr Wright Im sitting on the couch and the waters pouring in on my head And he said Madam move your chair So some years later I was doing a building a little house on the beach for Norton Simon and his secretary who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady called me and said Mr Simons sitting at his desk and the waters coming in on his head And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story RSW Didnt get a laugh FG No Not now either But my point is that  and I call it the then what OK you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice you loved your clients you loved the city youre a good guy youre a good person  and then what What do you bring to it And I think thats what Ive always been interested in is that  which is a personal kind of expression Bilbao I think shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city Thats what reminded me of it And I think thats the issue you know its the then what that most clients who hire architects  most clients arent hiring architects for that Theyre hiring them to get it done get it on budget be polite and theyre missing out on the real value of an architect RSW At a certain point a number of years ago people  when Michael Graves was a fashion before teapots  FG I did a teapot and nobody bought it RSW Did it leak FG No RSW  people wanted a Michael Graves building Is that a curse that people want a Bilbao building FG Yeah Since Bilbao opened which is now four five years both Krens and I have been called with at least  opportunities  China Brazil other parts of Spain  to come in and do the Bilbao effect And Ive met with some of these people Usually I say no right away but some of them come with pedigree and they sound wellintentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings In one case I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port I asked them what kind of building it was When you get here well explain it Blah blah blah So four of us went And they took us  they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor Each one was more beautiful than the other And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga Just before going to lunch with the mayor we went to the harbor commissioner It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here and I was here and my guys We sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet And the guy looked at me and said Now what can I do for you Mr Gehry RSW Oh my God FG So I got up I said to my team Lets get out of here We stood up we walked out They followed  the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said You mean youre not going to have lunch with the mayor I said Nope Youre not going to have dinner at all They just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project And we get a lot of that Luckily Im old enough that I can complain I cant travel I dont have my own plane yet RSW Well Im going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because its been very long But let me just say a couple words FG Can I say something Are you going to talk about me or you RSW Once a shit always a shit FG Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody so  RSW Youre going to get one Youre going to get one Im going to make it for you FG No no Wait a minute ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

14,Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories only to find out that youre a performance artist Im also a software engineer and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer And I think the main thing that Im interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft and in a way those are my bane I think theres a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about whats possible on the computer Of course its also a great liberating force that makes possible you know publishing and so forth and standards and so on But in a way the computer makes possible much more than what most people think and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer and so I end up writing software to do that Chris has asked me to do a short performance and so Im going to take just this time  maybe  minutes  to do that and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form Thank you Weve got about a minute left Id just like to show a clip from a most recent project I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica we repeated it in England And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were And since we know where their heads are and we have a wireless mic on them that were processing the sound from were able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what theyre doing with their speech This will take about  seconds or so Hes making a kind of cheekflapping sound Well suffice it to say its not all like that but thats part of it Thanks very much Theres always lots more Im overtime so I just wanted to say you can if youre in New York you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea And with that I think I should give up the stage so thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

16,"Id like to talk today
about the two biggest social trends in the coming century and perhaps in the next  years But I want to start
with my work on romantic love because thats my most recent work What I and my colleagues did was put
 people who were madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner  who were madly in love
and their love was accepted and  who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped And so I want to tell you
about that first and then go on into where
I think love is going What tis to love Shakespeare said I think our ancestors  I think human beings have been
wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was by looking at the last  years
of the psychological research and as it turns out theres a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love The first thing that happens is a person begins to take on
what I call special meaning As a truck driver once said to me The world had a new center
and that center was Mary Anne George Bernard Shaw said it differently Love consists of overestimating
the differences between one woman and another And indeed thats what we do And then you just focus on this person You can list what you
dont like about them but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do As Chaucer said Love is blind In trying to understand romantic love I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world and I just want to give
you one very short poem from eighthcentury China because its an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman Its a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot  their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party And in this case a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat And it goes like this Its by a guy called Yuan Zhen I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat The night I brought you home
I watched you roll it out He became hooked on a sleeping mat probably because of elevated activity
of dopamine in his brain just like with you and me But anyway not only does this person
take on special meaning you focus your attention on them You aggrandize them But you have intense energy As one Polynesian said
I felt like jumping in the sky Youre up all night
Youre walking till dawn You feel intense elation
when things are going well mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly Real dependence on this person As one businessman in New York said to me Anything she liked I liked Simple Romantic love is very simple You become extremely sexually possessive You know if youre just sleeping
with somebody casually you dont really care
if theyre sleeping with somebody else But the moment you fall in love you become extremely
sexually possessive of them I think theres a Darwinian
purpose to this The whole point of this
is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team But the main characteristics
of romantic love are craving an intense craving
to be with a particular person not just sexually but emotionally It would be nice to go to bed with them but you want them to call you
on the telephone to invite you out etc to tell you that they love you The other main characteristic
is motivation The motor in the brain begins to crank
and you want this person And last but not least
it is an obsession Before I put these people
in the MRI machine I would ask them all kinds of questions But my most important question
was always the same It was What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person And indeed they would say All day All night I can never stop thinking
about him or her And then the very last question  I would always have to work
myself up to this question because Im not a psychologist I dont work with people
in any kind of traumatic situation My final question was always the same I would say
Would you die for him or her And indeed these people would say Yes as if I had asked them to pass the salt I was just staggered by it So we scanned their brains looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph with a distraction task in between So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions In fact one of the most important
was a brain region that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine And indeed thats exactly what happens I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion In fact I had always thought
it was a series of emotions from very high to very low But actually its a drive It comes from the motor of the mind the wanting part of the mind
the craving part of the mind The kind of part of the mind when youre reaching
for that piece of chocolate when you want to win
that promotion at work The motor of the brain Its a drive And in fact I think its more powerful
than the sex drive You know if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you and they say No thank you you certainly dont kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression But certainly around the world people who are rejected
in love will kill for it People live for love They kill for love They die for love They have songs poems novels sculptures paintings myths legends In over  societies people have left their evidence
of this powerful brain system I have come to think its one of the most powerful
brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow And Ive also come to think that its one of three
basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction One is the sex drive
the craving for sexual gratification WH Auden called it
an intolerable neural itch and indeed thats what it is It keeps bothering you
a little bit like being hungry The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love that elation obsession of early love And the third brain system is attachment that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a longterm partner And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there looking for a whole range of partners You can feel it when youre just
driving along in your car It can be focused on nobody I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time thereby conserving mating time and energy And I think that attachment
the third brain system evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team So with that preamble I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends One of the last  years and the other
certainly of the last  years that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems lust romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner The first is women working
moving into the workforce Ive looked at  societies through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations Everywhere in the world
 out of  of them women are not only moving
into the job market  sometimes very very slowly
but they are moving into the job market  and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women in terms of economic power
health and education Its very slow For every trend on this planet
theres a countertrend We all know of them but nevertheless  the Arabs say The dogs may bark
but the caravan moves on And indeed that caravan is moving on Women are moving back into the job market And I say back into the job market
because this is not new For millions of years
on the grasslands of Africa women commuted to work
to gather their vegetables They came home with  to  percent
of the evening meal The double income family was the standard And women were regarded
as just as economically socially and sexually powerful as men In short were really
moving forward to the past Then womens worst
invention was the plow With the beginning of plow agriculture
mens roles became extremely powerful Women lost their ancient
jobs as collectors but then with the industrial revolution
and the postindustrial revolution theyre moving back into the job market In short they are acquiring the status
that they had a million years ago  years ago  years ago We are seeing now one
of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal And its going to have an impact I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women
on the business community Ill say just a couple of things
and then go on to sex and love Theres a lot of gender differences anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child I dont know why they want to think
that men and women are alike Theres much we have in common but theres a whole lot
that we do not have in common We are  in the words of Ted Hughes I think that we are like two feet
We need each other to get ahead But we did not evolve
to have the same brain And were finding more and more
gender differences in the brain Ill only just use a couple
and then move on to sex and love One of them is womens verbal ability Women can talk Womens ability to find the right word
rapidly basic articulation goes up in the middle
of the menstrual cycle when estrogen levels peak But even at menstruation
theyre better than the average man Women can talk Theyve been doing it for a million years
words were womens tools They held that baby
in front of their face cajoling it reprimanding it
educating it with words And indeed theyre becoming
a very powerful force Even in places like India and Japan where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market theyre moving into journalism And I think that the television
is like the global campfire We sit around it and it shapes our minds Almost always when Im on TV
the producer who calls me who negotiates what were going to say is a woman In fact Solzhenitsyn once said To have a great writer
is to have another government Today  percent of people
who are writers in America are women Its one of many many
characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market Theyve got incredible people skills
negotiating skills Theyre highly imaginative We now know the brain circuitry
of imagination of longterm planning They tend to be web thinkers Because the female parts
of the brain are better connected they tend to collect more
pieces of data when they think put them into more complex patterns
see more options and outcomes They tend to be contextual
holistic thinkers what I call web thinkers Men tend to  and these are averages  tend to get rid of what they regard
as extraneous focus on what they do and move in a more
stepbystep thinking pattern Theyre both perfectly good
ways of thinking We need both of them to get ahead In fact theres many more
male geniuses in the world And theres also many more
male idiots in the world When the male brain works well
it works extremely well And what I really think
that were doing is were moving towards
a collaborative society a society in which the talents
of both men and women are becoming understood
and valued and employed But in fact women moving
into the job market is having a huge impact
on sex and romance and family life Foremost women are starting
to express their sexuality Im always astonished
when people come to me and say Why is it that men are so adulterous Why do you think
more men are adulterous than women Well men are more adulterous And I say Who do you think
these men are sleeping with And  basic math Anyway In the Western world women start sooner at sex
have more partners express less remorse
for the partners that they do marry later have fewer children leave bad marriages
in order to get good ones We are seeing the rise
of female sexual expression And indeed once again were moving
forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands
of Africa a million years ago because this is the kind
of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today Were also returning
to an ancient form of marriage equality Theyre now saying that the st century is going to be the century of what
they call the symmetrical marriage or the pure marriage
or the companionate marriage This is a marriage between equals moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit Were also seeing a rise of romantic love  percent of American women
and  percent of American men would not marry somebody
who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner if they were not in love with that person People around the world
in a study of  societies want to be in love
with the person that they marry Indeed arranged marriages are
on their way off this braid of human life I even think that marriages
might even become more stable because of the second great world trend The first one being women
moving into the job market the second one being
the aging world population Theyre now saying that in America that middle age should be regarded
as up to age  Because in that highest
age category of  to  as much as  percent of people
have nothing really wrong with them So were seeing theres a real
extension of middle age For one of my books
I looked at divorce data in  societies And as it turns out the older you get
the less likely you are to divorce So the divorce rate right now
is stable in America and its actually beginning to decline It may decline some more I would even say that with Viagra estrogen replacement hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women  women have never been
as interesting as they are now Not at any time on this planet
have women been so educated so interesting so capable And so I honestly think that if there
really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make
good marriages that time is now However theres always kinds
of complications in this These three brain systems 
lust romantic love and attachment  dont always go together They can go together by the way Thats why casual sex isnt so casual With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine Dopamines associated with romantic love and you can just
fall in love with somebody who youre just having casual sex with With orgasm then you get a real rush
of oxytocin and vasopressin  those are associated with attachment This is why you can feel such a sense
of cosmic union with somebody after youve made love to them But these three brain systems
lust romantic love and attachment arent always connected to each other You can feel deep attachment
to a longterm partner while you feel intense
romantic love for somebody else while you feel the sex drive for people
unrelated to these other partners In short were capable of loving
more than one person at a time In fact you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings
of attachment for one person to deep feelings
of romantic love for somebody else Its as if theres a committee meeting
going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do So I dont think honestly were an animal
that was built to be happy we are an animal
that was built to reproduce I think the happiness we find we make And I think however we can make good relationships
with each other So I want to conclude with two things I want to conclude with a worry and with a wonderful story The worry is about antidepressants Over  million prescriptions
of antidepressants are written every year
in the United States And these drugs are going generic They are seeping around the world I know one girl whos been
on these antidepressants SSRIs serotoninenhancing
antidepressants  since she was  Shes  Shes been on them
ever since she was  Ive got nothing against people
who take them short term when theyre going
through something horrible They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else I would recommend it But more and more people
in the United States are taking them long term And indeed what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin And by raising levels of serotonin
you suppress the dopamine circuit Everybody knows that Dopamine is associated with romantic love Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit but they kill the sex drive And when you kill the sex drive
you kill orgasm And when you kill orgasm you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment The things are connected in the brain And when you tamper with one brain system youre going to tamper with another Im just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place So now  Thank you I want to end with a story And then just a comment Ive been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for  years Im an identical twin
I am interested in why were all alike Why you and I are alike
why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River are all alike And about a year ago an Internet dating service
Matchcom came to me and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them I said I dont know anything
about personality You know I dont know Do you think
youve got the right person They said Yes It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another Thats my current project
it will be my next book Theres all kinds of reasons that you fall in love
with one person rather than another Timing is important
Proximity is important Mystery is important You fall in love with somebody
whos somewhat mysterious in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love You fall in love with somebody who fits within
what I call your love map an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood
as you grow up And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people actually with somewhat
complementary brain systems And thats what Im now
contributing to this But I want to tell you
a story to illustrate Ive been carrying on here
about the biology of love I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it too the magic of it Its a story that was told to me by somebody who had
heard it just from one  probably a true story It was a graduate student 
Im at Rutgers and my two colleagues  Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook Thats where we put our people
in the MRI machine And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student and she was not in love with him And they were
all at a conference in Beijing And he knew from our work that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain and perhaps trigger
this brain system for romantic love So he decided hed put science to work And he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him And sure enough  Ive never been in one but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks and its crazy and its noisy
and its exciting He figured that this
would drive up the dopamine and shed fall in love with him So off they go and shes squealing
and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw and she throws her hands up and she says Wasnt that wonderful And Wasnt that rickshaw
driver handsome Theres magic to love But I will end by saying
that millions of years ago we evolved three basic drives the sex drive romantic love and attachment to a longterm partner These circuits are deeply
embedded in the human brain Theyre going to survive
as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called
this mortal coil Thank you Chris Anderson Helen Fisher ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

18,It is a thrill to be here at a conference thats devoted to Inspired by Nature  you can imagine And Im also thrilled to be in the foreplay section Did you notice this section is foreplay Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters which is the Western Grebe You havent lived until youve seen these guys do their courtship dance I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and my partner and I have a rowing shell And so we were rowing and one of these Western Grebes came along And what they do for their courtship dance is they go together the two of them the two mates and they begin to run underwater They paddle faster and faster and faster until theyre going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water and theyre standing upright sort of paddling the top of the water And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing And so were in a skull and were moving really really quickly And this Grebe I think sort of mistaked us for a prospect and started to run along the water next to us in a courtship dance  for miles It would stop and then start and then stop and then start Now that is foreplay I came this close to changing species at that moment Obviously life can teach us something in the entertainment section Life has a lot to teach us But what Id like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design Whats happened since the book came out  the book was mainly about research in biomimicry  and whats happened since then is architects designers engineers  people who make our world  have started to call and say we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us in real time become inspired Or  and this is the fun part for me  we want you to take us out into the natural world Well come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world who might inspire us So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers they purify wastewater And some of them were very resistant actually to being there What they said to us at first was you know we already do biomimicry We use bacteria to clean our water And we said well thats not exactly being inspired by nature Thats bioprocessing you know thats bioassisted technology using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old old technology called domestication This is learning something learning an idea from an organism and then applying it And so they still werent getting it So we went for a walk on the beach and I said well give me one of your big problems Give me a design challenge sustainability speed bump thats keeping you from being sustainable And they said scaling which is the buildup of minerals inside of pipes And they said you know what happens is mineral  just like at your house  mineral builds up And then the aperture closes and we have to flush the pipes with toxins or we have to dig them up So if we had some way to stop this scaling  and so I picked up some shells on the beach And I asked them what is scaling Whats inside your pipes And they said calcium carbonate And I said thats what this is this is calcium carbonate And they didnt know that They didnt know that what a seashell is its templated by proteins and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell So the same sort of a process without the proteins is happening on the inside of their pipes They didnt know This is not for lack of information its a lack of integration You know its a silo people in silos They didnt know that the same thing was happening So one of them thought about it and said OK well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater  selfassembly  then why arent shells infinite in size What stops the scaling Why dont they just keep on going And I said well in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization  and then they all sort of leaned in  they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal And in fact there is a product called TPA thats mimicked that protein  that stopprotein  and its an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes That changed everything From then on you could not get these engineers back in the boat The first day they would take a hike and it was click click click click Five minutes later they were back in the boat Were done You know Ive seen that island After this they were crawling all over They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve Learning about the natural world is one thing learning from the natural world  thats the switch Thats the profound switch What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world  billion years of fieldtesting  to   Craig Venter will probably tell you I think theres a lot more than  million  welladapted solutions The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context And the context is the Earth  the same context that were trying to solve our problems in So its the conscious emulation of lifes genius Its not slavishly mimicking  although Al is trying to get the hairdo going  its not a slavish mimicry its taking the design principles the genius of the natural world and learning something from it Now in a group with so many IT people I do have to mention what Im not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side So theres computers that protect themselves like an immune system and were learning from gene regulation and biological development And were learning from neural nets genetic algorithms evolutionary computing Thats on the software side But whats interesting to me is that we havent looked at this as much I mean these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that theres dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success So what can we learn about making  not just computers but everything The plane you came in cars the seats that youre sitting on How do we redesign the world that we make the humanmade world More importantly what should we ask in the next  years And theres a lot of cool technologies out there that life has Whats the syllabus Three questions for me are key How does life make things This is the opposite this is how we make things Its called heat beat and treat  thats what material scientists call it And its carving things down from the top with  percent waste left over and only  percent product You heat it up you beat it with high pressures you use chemicals OK Heat beat and treat Life cant afford to do that How does life make things How does life make the most of things Thats a geranium pollen And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily Look at that shape Life adds information to matter In other words structure It gives it information By adding information to matter it gives it a function thats different than without that structure And thirdly how does life make things disappear into systems Because life doesnt really deal in things there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems Really quick syllabus As Im reading more and more now and following the story there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences And at the same time Im listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are The two groups are not talking to each other At all What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that were in Im going to try to go through  really quickly One thats exciting to me is selfassembly Now youve heard about this in terms of nanotechnology Back to that shell the shell is a selfassembling material On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater Its a layered structure thats mineral and then polymer and it makes it very very tough Its twice as tough as our hightech ceramics But whats really interesting unlike our ceramics that are in kilns it happens in seawater It happens near in and near the organisms body This is Sandia National Labs A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a selfassembling coding process Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid lifting it out of the liquid and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works Imagine making all of our hard materials that way Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell to a solar cell onto a roof and having it selfassemble into a layered structure that harvests light Heres an interesting one for the IT world biosilicon This is a diatom which is made of silicates And so silicon which we make right now  its part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips  this is a biomineralization process thats now being mimicked This is at UC Santa Barbara Look at these diatoms This is from Ernst Haeckels work Imagine being able to  and again its a templated process and it solidifies out of a liquid process  imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature Imagine being able to make perfect lenses On the left this is a brittle star its covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever Its one of the most distortionfree lenses we know of And theres many of them all over its entire body Whats interesting again is that it selfassembles A woman named Joanna Aizenberg at Lucent is now learning to do this in a lowtemperature process to create these sort of lenses Shes also looking at fiber optics Thats a sea sponge that has a fiber optic Down at the very base of it theres fiber optics that work better than ours actually to move light but you can tie them in a knot theyre incredibly flexible Heres another big idea CO as a feedstock A guy named Geoff Coates at Cornell said to himself you know plants do not see CO as the biggest poison of our time We see it that way Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose right out of CO Hes found a way  hes found a catalyst  and hes found a way to take CO and make it into polycarbonates Biodegradable plastics out of CO  how plantlike Solar transformations the most exciting one There are people who are mimicking the energyharvesting device inside of purple bacterium the people at ASU Even more interesting lately in the last couple of weeks people have seen that theres an enzyme called hydrogenase thats able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons and is able to take hydrogen up  basically whats happening in a fuel cell in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell In our fuel cells we do it with platinum life does it with a very very common iron And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogenjuggling hydrogenase Thats very exciting for fuel cells  to be able to do that without platinum Power of shape heres a whale Weve seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in for instance the edge of an airplane  increase efficiency by about  percent Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing Color without pigments this peacock is creating color with shape Light comes through it bounces back off the layers its called thinfilm interference Imagine being able to selfassemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface so that its selfcleaning with just water Thats what a leaf does See that upclose picture Thats a ball of water and those are dirt particles And thats an upclose picture of a lotus leaf Theres a company making a product called Lotusan which mimics  when the building facade paint dries it mimics the bumps in a selfcleaning leaf and rainwater cleans the building Water is going to be our big grand challenge quenching thirst Here are two organisms that pull water The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog The one on the right is a pill bug  pulls water out of air does not drink fresh water Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta before it gets into a building are key technologies Separation technologies are going to be extremely important What if we were to say no more hard rock mining What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams small amounts of metals in water Thats what microbes do they chelate metals out of water Theres a company here in San Francisco called MR that is embedding mimics of the microbes molecules on filters to mine waste streams Green chemistry is chemistry in water We do chemistry in organic solvents This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider Isnt that beautiful Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with natures recipe book Its not easy because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table And we use all of them even the toxic ones To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table and create miracle materials like that cell is the task of green chemistry Timed degradation packaging that is good until you dont want it to be good anymore and dissolves on cue Thats a mussel you can find in the waters out here and the threads holding it to a rock are timed at exactly two years they begin to dissolve Healing this is a good one That little guy over there is a tardigrade There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken whats called the cold chain gets broken A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade  which dries out completely and yet stays alive for months and months and months and is able to regenerate itself And he found a way to dry out vaccines  encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells  meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated They can be put in a glove compartment OK Learning from organisms This is a session about water  learning about organisms that can do without water in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration Im not going to get to  But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing besides all of these adaptations is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place thats going to take care of their offspring When theyre involved in foreplay theyre thinking about something very very important  and thats having their genetic material remain  generations from now And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place thatll take care of their offspring Thats the biggest design challenge Luckily there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas Good luck having a conversation with them Thank you Chris Anderson Talk about foreplay I  we need to get to  but really quickly Janine Benyus Oh really CA Yeah Just like you know like the second version of   and  Because we just  your slides are so gorgeous and the ideas are so big I cant stand to let you go down without seeing   and  JB OK put this  OK Ill just hold this thing OK great OK so thats the healing one Sensing and responding feedback is a huge thing This is a locust There can be  million of them in a square kilometer and yet they dont collide with one another And yet we have  million car collisions a year Right Theres a person at Newcastle who has figured out that its a very large neuron And shes actually figuring out how to make a collisionavoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust This is a huge and important one number  And thats the growing fertility That means you know net fertility farming We should be growing fertility And oh yes  we get food too Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life And really thats what other organisms do as well In ensemble thats what whole ecosystems do they create more and more opportunities for life Our farming has done the opposite So farming based on how a prairie builds soil ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water but creates incredibly sparkling productivity This is the simple design brief I mean it looks simple because the system over  billion years has worked this out That is those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places are not around to tell us about it Thats the twelfth one Life  and this is the secret trick this is the magic trick  life creates conditions conducive to life It builds soil it cleans air it cleans water it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs So its not mutually exclusive We have to find a way to meet our needs while making of this place an Eden CA Janine thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

19,I dont know about you but I havent quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life Ive spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about Should I be protechnology Should I embrace it full arms Should I be wary Like you Im very tempted by the latest thing But at the other hand a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions sold all my technology  except for a bicycle  and rode across  miles on the US back roads under the power of my one body fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food And Ive since then tried to keep technology at arms length in many ways so it doesnt master my life At the same time I run a website on cool tools where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology So Im still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity as it relates to nature as it relates to the spiritual And Im not even sure we know what technology is And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in  Before that obviously technology didnt exist But obviously it did I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born So it sums up a lot of what were talking about Danny Hillis actually has an update on that  he says technology is anything that doesnt quite work yet Which also I think gets into a little bit of our current idea But I was interested in another definition of technology Something again that went back to something more fundamental Something that was deeper And as I struggled to understand that I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations And Im this morning going to talk about this for the first time So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud The question that I came up with was this question what does technology want And by that I dont mean does it want chocolate or vanilla By what it wants I mean what are its inherent trends and biases What are its tendencies over time One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms which weve heard a lot about And the trick that Richard Dawkins does which is to say to look at them as simply as genes as vehicles for genes So hes saying what do genes want The selfish gene And Im applying a similar trick to say what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology What does technology want Obviously this in an incomplete question just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it But its still very very productive So Im attempting to say if we take technologys view of the world what does it want And I think once we ask that question we have to go back actually to life Because obviously if we keep extending the origins of technology far back I think we come back to life at some point So thats where I want to begin my little exploration is in life And like you heard from the previous speakers we dont really know what life there is on Earth right now We have really no idea Craig Venters tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great Brian Farrells work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects just to see whats on life And if we did that with our little Martian probe which we have not done on Earth we would begin to see some incredible species This is not on another planet These are things that are hidden away on our planet This is an ant that stores its colleagues honey in its abdomen Each one of these organisms that weve described  that youve seen from Jamie and others these magnificent things  what theyre doing each one of them is theyre hacking the rules of life I cant think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism Every single thing that we can think of  and if you heard Olivias talk about the sexual habits youll realize that there isnt anything we can say thats true for all life because every single one of them is hacking something about it This is a solarpowered sea slug Its a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy This is another version of that This is a sea dragon and the one on the bottom the blue one is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid has not yet taken in the browngreen algae pond scum into its body to give it energy These are hacks and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are current consensus six kingdoms Six different broad approaches the plants the animals the fungi the protests  the little things  the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria The Archaeas Those are the general approaches to life Thats one way to look at life on Earth today But a more interesting way the current way to take the long view is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time we have it coming out from the center So in the center is the most primitive and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth This is all the same six kingdoms You see  representative species and you can see where we are But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans Theyve been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here But we see that each one of these is actually hacking and has a different way of finding out how to do life And if we take the longterm trends of life if we begin to say what does evolution want Theres several things that we see One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we dont find life We find life at the bottom of every longterm longdistance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up  and theres bacteria in the pores of that rock And wherever life is it never retreats Its ubiquitous and it wants to be more More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life The second thing is is we see diversity We also see specialization We see the movement from a generalpurpose cell to the more specific and specialized And we see a drift towards complexity thats very intuitive And actually we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time And the last thing I bring back this nudibranch One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life Like those chloroplast cells  theyre completely surrounded by other life They never touch the inner matter There is more and more coevolution And so the general longterm trends of evolution are roughly these five ubiquity diversity specialization complexity and socialization Now I took that and said OK what are the longterm trends in technology And again my question is what does technology want And so remarkably I discovered that theres also a drift toward specialization That we see theres a general hammer and hammers become more and more specific over time Theres obviously diversity Huge numbers of things This is all the contents of a Japanese home I actually had my daughter  gave her a tally counter and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household And it came up with  different species of products I did some research and found out that the King of England Henry VIII had only about  items in his household And he was the King of England and that was the entire wealth of England at the time So were seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things This is a scene from Star Wars where the PO comes out and he sees machines making machines How depraved Well this is actually what were headed towards world machines And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not nontechnology or even life And thirdly the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche And Im happy to say I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological but thats pretty evident So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution The same drives that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization towards complexity That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out say the evolution of armor you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionarytype cladistic tree I suggest that in fact technology is the seventh kingdom of life That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom And so it would be sort of approximately up there coming out of the animal kingdom And if we were to do that we would find out  we could actually approach technology in this way This is Niles Eldredge He was the codeveloper with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium But as a sideline he happens to collect cornets He has one of the worlds largest collections  about  of them And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites or snails and to do a morphological analysis and try to derive their genealogical history over time This is his chart which is not quite published yet But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made That does not happen in biology When something is extinct you cant have it as your parent But that does happen in technology And it turns out that thats so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system In fact this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology And it turns out that in fact technologies dont die So I suggested this to an historian of science and he said Well what about you know come on what about steam cars Theyre not around anymore Well actually they are In fact theyre so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile And this is a website of a guy whos selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile And the thing that I liked is sort of this oneclick addtoyourcart button  Laughter  for buying steam valves I mean it was just  it was really there And so I began to think about well maybe thats just a random sample Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way So I took the great big  Montgomery Wards catalog and I randomly went through it And I took a page  not quite a random page  I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made But I took this page and I said how many of these things are still being made And not antiques I want to know how many of these things are still in production And the answer is all of them All of them are still being produced So youve got corn shellers I dont know who needs a corn sheller Be it corn shellers  youve got ploughs youve got fan mills all these things  and these are not again antiques These are  you can order these You can go to the web and you can buy them now brandnew made So in a certain sense technologies dont die In fact you can buy for  bucks a stoneage knife made exactly the same way that they were made  years ago Its short bone handle  bucks And in fact whats important is that this information actually never died out Its not just that it was resurrected Its continued all along And in Papua New Guinea they were making stone axes until two decades ago just as a course of practical matters Even when we try to get rid of a technology its actually very hard So weve all heard about the Amish giving up cars Weve heard about the Japanese giving up guns Weve heard about this and that But I actually went back and took what I could find the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology and then I tried to find out when they came back in because they always came back in And it turns out that the time the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited is decreasing over time And that basically you can delay technology but you cant kill it So this makes sense because in a certain sense what culture is is the accumulation of ideas Thats what its for Its so that ideas dont die out And when we take that we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the longterm trajectory  again in lifes evolution  we find that each case  each of the major transitions in life  what theyre really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens Theyre actually changing the way in which ideas are generated So all these steps in evolution are increasing basically the evolution of evolvability So whats happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas these new hacks are increasing And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring And then what we see in the singularity that prophesized by Kurzweil and others  his idea that technology is accelerating evolution Its accelerating the way in which we search for ideas So if you have life hacking  life means hacking the game of survival  then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve That is what we call an infinite game Thats the definition of infinite game A finite game is play to win and an infinite game is played to keep playing And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force The origins of technology was not in  but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot and it was so tight in there there was no room for any difference at all Thats the definition There was no temperature There was no difference whatsoever And at the Big Bang what it expanded was the potential for difference So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences diversity options choices opportunities possibilities and freedoms Those are all basically the same thing And those are the things that technology brings us Thats what technology is bringing us choices possibilities freedoms Thats what its about Its this expansion of room to make differences And so a hammer when we grab a hammer thats what were grabbing And thats why we continue to grab technology  because we want those things Those things are good Differences freedom choices possibilities And each time we make a new opportunity place were allowing a platform to make new ones And I think its really important Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented  what a loss to society there would be Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film Somewhere today there are millions of young children being born whose technology of selfexpression has not yet been invented We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals Thats what technology really wants Im going to skip through some of the objections because I dont have answers to why theres deforestation I dont have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies I dont have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom because its so close to what life is about maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life Maybe in some ways the fact that what were trying to do with technology is find a good home for it Its a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields but its a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village Our humanity is actually defined by technology All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology This is the infinite game Thats what were talking about You see technology is a way to evolve the evolution Its a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more And its actually a way of playing the game of playing all the games Thats what technology wants And so when I think about what technology wants I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here  and I really believe this  every person here has an assignment And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is That recursive nature is the infinite game And if you play that well youll have other people involved so even that game extends and continues even when youre gone That is the infinite game And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

20,"I think I was supposed
to talk about my new book which is called Blink and its about snap judgments
and first impressions And it comes out in January
and I hope you all buy it in triplicate But I was thinking about this and I realized that although
my new book makes me happy and I think would make my mother happy its not really about happiness So I decided instead
I would talk about someone who I think has done as much
to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last  years a man who is a great
personal hero of mine someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz who is most famous
for reinventing spaghetti sauce Howards about this high and hes round and hes in his s
and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair and he has a kind of wonderful
exuberance and vitality and he has a parrot
and he loves the opera and hes a great aficionado
of medieval history And by profession hes a psychophysicist Now I should tell you that I have no idea
what psychophysics is although at some point in my life I dated a girl for two years who was getting
her doctorate in psychophysics Which should tell you something
about that relationship As far as I know psychophysics
is about measuring things And Howard is very interested
in measuring things And he graduated
with his doctorate from Harvard and he set up a little consulting shop
in White Plains New York And one of his first clients was Pepsi This is many years ago
back in the early s And Pepsi came to Howard and they said You know theres this new
thing called aspartame and we would like to make Diet Pepsi Wed like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put
in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink Now that sounds like an incredibly
straightforward question to answer and thats what Howard thought Because Pepsi told him Were working with a band
between eight and  percent Anything below eight percent
sweetness is not sweet enough anything above  percent
sweetness is too sweet We want to know whats the sweet
spot between  and  Now if I gave you this problem to do
you would all say its very simple What we do is you make up
a big experimental batch of Pepsi at every degree of sweetness 
eight percent    all the way up to   and we try this out
with thousands of people and we plot the results on a curve and we take the most popular
concentration right Really simple Howard does the experiment
and he gets the data back and he plots it on a curve and all of a sudden he realizes
its not a nice bell curve In fact the data doesnt make any sense Its a mess Its all over the place Now most people in that business
in the world of testing food and such are not dismayed
when the data comes back a mess They think Well you know figuring out what people think
about colas not that easy You know maybe we made an error
somewhere along the way You know lets just
make an educated guess and they simply point
and they go for  percent right in the middle Howard is not so easily placated Howard is a man of a certain degree
of intellectual standards And this was not good enough for him and this question bedeviled him for years And he would think it through
and say What was wrong Why could we not make sense
of this experiment with Diet Pepsi And one day he was sitting
in a diner in White Plains about to go trying to dream up
some work for Nescaf� And suddenly like a bolt of lightning
the answer came to him And that is that when they analyzed
the Diet Pepsi data they were asking the wrong question They were looking for the perfect Pepsi and they should have been
looking for the perfect Pepsis Trust me This was an enormous revelation This was one of the most brilliant
breakthroughs in all of food science Howard immediately went on the road and he would go to conferences
around the country and he would stand up and say You had been looking
for the perfect Pepsi Youre wrong You should be looking
for the perfect Pepsis And people would look at him
blankly and say What are you talking about Craziness And they would say Move Next Tried to get business
nobody would hire him  he was obsessed though and he talked about it
and talked about it Howard loves the Yiddish expression To a worm in horseradish
the world is horseradish This was his horseradish He was obsessed with it And finally he had a breakthrough Vlasic Pickles came to him and they said Doctor Moskowitz
we want to make the perfect pickle And he said There is no perfect pickle
there are only perfect pickles And he came back to them and he said You dont just need
to improve your regular you need to create zesty And thats where we got zesty pickles Then the next person came to him
Campbells Soup And this was even more important In fact Campbells Soup
is where Howard made his reputation Campbells made Prego and Prego in the early s
was struggling next to Rag� which was the dominant
spaghetti sauce of the s and s In the industry  I dont
know whether you care about this or how much time I have to go into this But it was technically speaking
 this is an aside  Prego is a better tomato sauce than Rag� The quality of the tomato paste
is much better the spice mix is far superior it adheres to the pasta
in a much more pleasing way In fact they would do
the famous bowl test back in the s with Rag� and Prego Youd have a plate of spaghetti
and you would pour it on right And the Rag� would all go to the bottom
and the Prego would sit on top Thats called adherence And anyway despite the fact
that they were far superior in adherence and the quality of their tomato paste Prego was struggling So they came to Howard
and they said fix us And Howard looked
at their product line and he said what you have is a dead tomato society So he said this is what I want to do And he got together
with the Campbells soup kitchen and he made  varieties
of spaghetti sauce And he varied them according
to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce by sweetness by level of garlic by tomatoeyness
by tartness by sourness by visible solids  my favorite term
in the spaghetti sauce business Every conceivable way
you can vary spaghetti sauce he varied spaghetti sauce And then he took this whole raft
of  spaghetti sauces and he went on the road He went to New York to Chicago he went to Jacksonville to Los Angeles And he brought in people
by the truckload into big halls And he sat them down for two hours and over the course of that two hours
he gave them ten bowls Ten small bowls of pasta with a different spaghetti
sauce on each one And after they ate each bowl
they had to rate from  to  how good they thought
the spaghetti sauce was At the end of that process
after doing it for months and months he had a mountain of data about how the American people
feel about spaghetti sauce And then he analyzed the data Did he look for the most popular
variety of spaghetti sauce No Howard doesnt believe
that there is such a thing Instead he looked
at the data and he said lets see if we can group all these
different data points into clusters Lets see if they congregate
around certain ideas And sure enough if you sit down and you analyze all this data
on spaghetti sauce you realize that all Americans
fall into one of three groups There are people
who like their spaghetti sauce plain there are people
who like their spaghetti sauce spicy and there are people
who like it extra chunky And of those three facts
the third one was the most significant because at the time in the early s if you went to a supermarket you would not find
extrachunky spaghetti sauce And Prego turned to Howard and they said Youre telling me
that one third of Americans crave extrachunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs And he said Yes And Prego then went back and completely reformulated
their spaghetti sauce and came out with a line of extra chunky
that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce
business in this country And over the next  years
they made  million dollars off their line of extrachunky sauces Everyone else in the industry looked
at what Howard had done and they said Oh my god Weve been
thinking all wrong And thats when you started to get
seven different kinds of vinegar and  different kinds of mustard
and  different kinds of olive oil And then eventually
even Rag� hired Howard and Howard did the exact same thing
for Rag� that he did for Prego And today if you go
to a really good supermarket do you know how many Rag�s there are  In six varieties Cheese Light Robusto Rich amp Hearty Old World Traditional  ExtraChunky Garden Thats Howards doing That is Howards gift
to the American people Now why is that important It is in fact enormously important Ill explain to you why What Howard did is he fundamentally
changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy Assumption number one
in the food industry used to be that the way to find out
what people want to eat what will make people happy
is to ask them And for years and years and years Rag� and Prego would have focus groups and they would sit you down
and they would say What do you want in a spaghetti sauce Tell us what you want
in a spaghetti sauce And for all those years    years  through all those focus group sessions no one ever said they wanted extrachunky Even though at least a third of them
deep in their hearts actually did People dont know what they want As Howard loves to say The mind knows not
what the tongue wants Its a mystery And a critically important step in understanding
our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always
explain what we want deep down If I asked all of you for example
in this room what you want in a coffee you know what youd say Every one of you would say
I want a dark rich hearty roast Its what people always say
when you ask them What do you like
Dark rich hearty roast What percentage of you actually
like a dark rich hearty roast According to Howard somewhere
between  and  percent of you Most of you like milky weak coffee But you will never ever say
to someone who asks you what you want that I want a milky weak coffee So thats number one thing
that Howard did Number two thing that Howard did
is he made us realize  its another very critical point  he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call
horizontal segmentation Why is this critical Because this is the way the food industry
thought before Howard What were they obsessed with
in the early s They were obsessed with mustard In particular they were obsessed
with the story of Grey Poupon Used to be there were two mustards
Frenchs and Guldens What were they Yellow mustard Whats in it Yellow mustard seeds
turmeric and paprika That was mustard Grey Poupon came along with a Dijon Right Much more volatile brown mustard seed
some white wine a nose hit much more delicate aromatics And what do they do They put it in a little tiny glass jar
with a wonderful enameled label on it made it look French even though its made
in Oxnard California And instead of charging a dollar fifty
for the eightounce bottle the way that Frenchs and Guldens did they decided to charge four dollars And they had those ads With the guy in the Rolls Royce
eating the Grey Poupon Another pulls up and says
Do you have any Grey Poupon And the whole thing after they did that
Grey Poupon takes off Takes over the mustard business And everyones takehome lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something
that is more expensive something to aspire to Its to make them turn their back
on what they think they like now and reach out for something
higher up the mustard hierarchy A better mustard
A more expensive mustard A mustard of more sophistication
and culture and meaning And Howard looked to that
and said Thats wrong Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy Mustard exists just like tomato sauce
on a horizontal plane There is no good mustard or bad mustard There is no perfect mustard
or imperfect mustard There are only different kinds of mustards
that suit different kinds of people He fundamentally democratized
the way we think about taste And for that as well we owe
Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks Third thing that Howard did
and perhaps the most important is Howard confronted the notion
of the Platonic dish What do I mean by that For the longest time in the food industry there was a sense that there was one way a perfect way to make a dish You go to Chez Panisse they give you the redtail sashimi
with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction They dont give you five options
on the reduction They dont say Do you want
the extrachunky reduction or  No You just get the reduction Why Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion
about redtail sashimi This is the way it ought to be And she serves it that way
time and time again and if you quarrel with her she will say You know what Youre wrong This is the best way it ought to be
in this restaurant Now that same idea fueled
the commercial food industry as well They had a Platonic notion
of what tomato sauce was And where did that come from
It came from Italy Italian tomato sauce is what Its blended its thin The culture of tomato sauce was thin When we talked about authentic
tomato sauce in the s we talked about Italian tomato sauce we talked about the earliest Rag�s which had no visible solids right Which were thin you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom
of the pasta Thats what it was And why were we attached to that Because we thought
that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most
culturally authentic tomato sauce A And B we thought that if we gave them
the culturally authentic tomato sauce then they would embrace it And thats what would please
the maximum number of people In other words people in the cooking world
were looking for cooking universals They were looking for one way
to treat all of us And its good reason for them
to be obsessed with the idea of universals because all of science through the th century
and much of the th was obsessed with universals Psychologists medical scientists
economists were all interested
in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave But that changed right What is the great revolution
in science of the last   years It is the movement
from the search for universals to the understanding of variability Now in medical science
we dont want to know necessarily just how cancer works we want to know how your cancer
is different from my cancer I guess my cancer different
from your cancer Genetics has opened the door
to the study of human variability What Howard Moskowitz
was doing was saying This same revolution needs to happen
in the world of tomato sauce And for that we owe him
a great vote of thanks Ill give you one last
illustration of variability and that is  oh Im sorry Howard not only believed that
but he took it a second step which was to say that when we pursue
universal principles in food we arent just making an error we are actually doing ourselves
a massive disservice And the example he used was coffee And coffee is something he did
a lot of work with with Nescaf� If I were to ask all of you to try
and come up with a brand of coffee  a type of coffee a brew 
that made all of you happy and then I asked you to rate that coffee the average score in this room for coffee
would be about  on a scale of  to  If however you allowed me
to break you into coffee clusters maybe three or four coffee clusters and I could make coffee just
for each of those individual clusters your scores would go from  to  or  The difference between coffee
at  and coffee at  is a difference between coffee
that makes you wince and coffee that makes you
deliriously happy That is the final and I think
most beautiful lesson of Howard Moskowitz that in embracing the diversity
of human beings we will find a surer way
to true happiness Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

21,"Over the past couple of days as Ive been preparing for my speech Ive become more and more nervous
about what Im going to say and about being on the same stage
as all these fascinating people Being on the same stage as Al Gore
who was the first person I ever voted for And  So I was getting pretty nervous and you know I didnt know
that Chris sits on the stage and thats more nerveracking But then I started thinking
about my family I started thinking about my father
and my grandfather and my greatgrandfather and I realized that I had all of these Teds
going through my bloodstream  that I had to consider this my element So who am I Chris kind of mentioned I started
a company with my husband We have about  people internationally If you looked in the book you saw this  which I really was appalled by And because I wanted
to impress you all with slides since I saw the great presentations
yesterday with graphs I made a graph that moves and I talk about the makeup of me So besides this freakish thing this is my science slide This is math and this is science
this is genetics This is my grandmother
and this is where I get this mouth So  Im a blogger which probably
to a lot of you means different things You may have heard
about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite
lock using a ballpoint pen and it spread all over Kryptonite had to adjust the lock and they had to address it
to avoid too many customer concerns You may have heard about Rathergate which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the th in  is not typeset on an old typewriter its on Word Bloggers exposed this or they worked hard to expose this You know blogs are scary
This is what you see I see this and Im sure scared 
I swear on stage  shitless about blogs because this is not
something thats friendly But there are blogs that are changing
the way we read news and consume media
and these are great examples These people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and thats incredibly important During the hurricane you had MSNBC posting
about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently This was possible because of the easy
nature of blogging tools You have my friend who has a blog on PVRs
personal recorders He makes enough money just by running ads to support his family up in Oregon Thats all he does now and this is something
that blogs have made possible And then you have something
like this which is Interplast Its a wonderful organization of people and doctors
who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery
to those who need it Children with cleft palates get it
and they document their story This is wonderful I am not that caring I talk about myself Thats what I am Im a blogger I have always decided that I was going
to be an expert on one thing and I am an expert on this person and so I write about it So the short story about my blog it started in  I was  I wasnt happy with my job because I was a designer but I wasnt being really stimulated I was an English major in college I didnt have any use for it
but I missed writing So I started to write a blog and I started to create things
like these little stories This was an illustration about my camp
experience when I was  years old and how I went to a YMCA camp
Christian camp and basically by the end I had made my friends hate me so much
that I hid in a bunk They couldnt find me
they sent a search party and I overheard people saying
they wish I had killed myself  jumped off Bible Peak You can laugh this is OK This is me This is what happened to me And when I started my blog
it was really this one goal  I said I am not going
to be famous to the world but I could be famous
to people on the Internet And I set a goal I said Im going to win an award because I had never won
an award in my entire life And I said Im going to win
the South by Southwest Weblog award And I won it  I reached
all of these people and I had tens of thousands of people
reading about my life every day And then I wrote a post about a banjo I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo  a  banjo which is a lot of money And I dont play instruments I dont know anything about music I like music and I like banjos and I think I probably heard
Steve Martin playing and I said I could do that And I said to my husband Ben can I buy a banjo
And hes like No And my husband  this is my husband who is very hot  he won an award for being hot He told me You cannot buy a banjo Youre just like your dad
who collects instruments And I wrote a post
about how I was so mad at him he was such a tyrant 
he would not let me buy this banjo And those people who know me
understood my joke  this is Mena this is how
I make a joke at people Because the joke in this
is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog And if he knew I was showing
this right now  I put this in today  he would kill me But the thing was my friends read it and theyre like Oh that Mena
she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing
and being stupid But I got emails from people that said Oh my God your husband
is such an asshole How much money does
he spend on beer in a year You could take that money
and buy your banjo Why dont you open a separate account Ive been with him since I was 
weve never had a separate bank account They said Separate your bank account Spend your money
spend his money thats it And then I got people saying Leave him I was like OK what
Who are these people And why are they reading this And I realized I dont
want to reach these people I dont want to write
for this public audience And I started to kill my blog slowly Im like I dont want
to write this anymore Slowly and slowly  And I did tell personal
stories from time to time I wrote this one and I put this
up because of Einstein today Im going to get choked up
because this is my first pet and she passed away two years ago And I decided to break from I dont
really write about my public life because I wanted to give her
a little memorial But anyways its these sorts
of personal stories  You know you read the blogs
about politics or about media and gossip and all these things These are out there but its more of the personal
that interests me and this is who I am You see Norman Rockwell
and you have art critics say Norman Rockwell is not art Norman Rockwell hangs
in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not something
to be considered high art And I think this is one
of the most important things to us as humans These things resonate with us and if you think about blogs
you think of high art blogs the history paintings about
you know all the biblical stories and then you have this These are the blogs that interest me
the people that just tell stories One story is about this baby
and his name is Odin His father was a blogger And he was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth to her baby at  weeks And he never expected this One day it was normal
the next day it was hell And this is a onepound baby So Odin was documented every single day Pictures were taken every day
day one day two  You have day nine 
theyre talking about his apnea day   he gets pneumonia His baby is so small and Ive never encountered such a  just  a disturbing image
but just so heartfelt And youre reading this as it happens so on day  everybody reads
that hes having failures breathing failures and heart failures and its slowing down
and you dont know what to expect But then it gets better
Day  he goes home And you see this post Thats not something youre going
to see in a paper or magazine but this is something this person feels and people are excited
about it   comments Thats not a huge amount
of people reading but  people matter And today he is a healthy baby who if you read his blog  its snowdealorg his fathers blog  he is taking pictures of him still
because he is still his son and he is I think
at his age level right now because he had received such
great treatment from the hospital So blogs So what Youve probably
heard these things before We talked about the WELL
and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history But I think blogs are basically
just an evolution and thats where we are today Its this record
of who you are your persona You have your Google search
where you say What is Mena Trott And then you find these things
and youre happy or unhappy But then you also find peoples blogs and those are the records of people
that are writing daily  not necessarily about the same topic
but things that interest them And we talk about the world
flattens being in this panel and I am very optimistic 
whenever I think about blogs Im like Weve got to reach
all these people Hundreds of millions
and billions of people Were getting into China
we want to be there but there are so many people that
wont have the access to write a blog But to see something
like the  computer is amazing because blogging software is simple We have a successful company
because of timing and because of perseverance
but its simple stuff  its not rocket science And so thats an amazing
thing to consider So  the life record of a blog is something
that I find incredibly important And we started with a slide of my Teds and I had to add this slide because I knew the minute
I showed this my mom  my mom will see this
because she does read my blog and shell say Why wasnt there
a picture of me This is my mom So I have all the people that I know of But this is basically the extent
of the family that I know in terms of my direct line I showed a Norman Rockwell painting
before and this one I grew up with looking at constantly I would spend hours
looking at the connections saying Oh the little kid
up at the top has red hair so does that first generation up there And its just these little things This is not science
but this was enough for me to be really interested
in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line So that has always influenced me I have this record this  census of another Grabowski 
thats my maiden name  and theres a Theodore
because theres always a Theodore This is all I have
a couple of facts about somebody I have their date of birth their age
what they did in their household if they spoke English and thats it thats all I know
of these people And its pretty sad because I only go back
five generations and thats it I dont even know what happens
on my moms side because shes from Cuba
and I dont have that many things Just doing this
I spent time in the archives  thats why my husbands a saint  I spent time in the Washington archives just sitting there
looking for these things Now its online but he sat through that And so you have this record and  This is my greatgreatgrandmother This is the only picture I have And to think of what we have the ability
to do with our blogs to think about the people
that are on those  computers talking about who they are
sharing these personal stories  this is an amazing thing Another photo that has
greatly influenced me or a series of photos is this project thats done by an Argentinean
man and his wife And hes basically taking a picture
of his family every day for the past what is    
Oh my God Im    years Twentynine years There was a joke originally
about my graph that I left out which is You see all this math Im just happy I was able
to add it up to  because thats my skill set So you have these people aging and now this is them today or last year And thats a powerful thing
to have to be able to track this I wish that I would have
this of my family I know that one day my children
will be wondering  or my grandchildren
or my greatgrandchildren if I ever have children  what I am going to  who I was So I do something
thats very narcissistic  I am a blogger  that is an amazing thing for me because it captures
a moment in time every day I take a picture of myself 
Ive been doing this since last year  every single day And you know its the same picture its basically the same person Only a couple of people read it I dont write this for this audience Im showing it now but I would go
insane if this was really public About four people probably read it and they tell me You havent updated Im probably going to get people
telling me I havent updated But this is amazing because I can
go back to a day  to April  and say what was I doing this day I look at it I know exactly Its this visual cue
that is so important to what we do I put the bad pictures up too because there are bad pictures And I remember instantly
I am in Germany in this  I had to go for a oneday trip I was sick and I was in a hotel room and I wanted not to be there And so you see these things
its not just always smiling Now Ive kind of evolved it
so I have this look If you look at my drivers license
I have the same look and its a pretty disturbing thing but its something
that is really important And the last story
I really want to tell is this story because this is probably the one
that means the most to me in all of what Im doing Ill probably get choked up
because I tend to when I talk about this So this woman her name was Emma and she was a blogger
on our service TypePad And she was a beta tester
so she was there right when we opened  you know there was  people And she wrote about her life
dealing with cancer She was writing and writing
and we all started reading it because we had
so few blogs on the service we could keep track of everyone And she was writing one day and then she disappeared for a little bit And her sister came on and she said
that Emma had passed away And all of our support staff who had
talked to her were really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company And this was one of those
instances where I realized how much blogging
affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world That this woman is in England and she lives  she lived  a life where she was talking
about what she was doing But the big thing
that really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said  and she wrote on this blog  that writing her blog during
the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing
that had happened to her and being able to talk to people
and to share what was going on and being able to write
and receive comments And that was amazing to be able to know
that we had empowered that and that blogging was something
that she felt comfortable doing and the idea that blogging
doesnt have to be scary that we dont always have
to be attack of the blogs that we can be people who are open
and wanting to help and talk to people That was an amazing thing And so I printed out and sent
a PDF of her blog to her family and they passed it
out at her memorial service and even in her obituary
they mentioned her blog because it was such
a big part of her life And thats a huge thing So this is her legacy and I think that my call to action
to all of you is think about blogs
think about what they are think about what youve thought of them and then actually do it because its something
thats really going to change our lives So thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

22,"Im Michael Shermer
director of the Skeptics Society publisher of Skeptic magazine We investigate claims of the paranormal pseudoscience fringe groups and cults
and claims of all kinds between science and pseudoscience
and nonscience and junk science voodoo science pathological science
bad science nonscience and plain old nonsense And unless youve been on Mars recently you know theres a lot of that out there Some people call us debunkers
which is kind of a negative term But lets face it theres a lot of bunk We are like the bunko squads
of the police departments out there  well were sort of like
the Ralph Naders of bad ideas trying to replace bad ideas
with good ideas Ill show you an example of a bad idea I brought this with me this was given to us
by NBC Dateline to test Its produced by the Quadro
Corporation of West Virginia Its called the Quadro  Dowser Rod This was being sold to highschool
administrators for  apiece Its a piece of plastic with a Radio
Shack antenna attached to it You could dowse for all sorts of things but this particular one was built
to dowse for marijuana in students lockers So the way it works
is you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts
toward a particular locker and then you open the locker So it looks something like this Ill show you Well it has kind of a rightleaning bias Well this is science
so well do a controlled experiment Itll go this way for sure Sir do you want to empty
your pockets please sir So the question was can it actually
find marijuana in students lockers And the answer is
if you open enough of them yes But in science we have to keep track
of the misses not just the hits And thats probably the key lesson
to my short talk here This is how psychics work astrologers
tarot card readers and so on People remember the hits
and forget the misses In science we keep the whole database and look to see if the number
of hits somehow stands out from the total number
youd expect by chance In this case we tested it We had two opaque boxes one with governmentapproved THC
marijuana and one with nothing And it got it  percent of the time  which is exactly what youd expect
with a coinflip model So thats just a fun little example
here of the sorts of things we do Skeptic is the quarterly publication
Each one has a particular theme This one is on the future of intelligence Are people getting smarter or dumber I have an opinion of this myself
because of the business Im in but in fact people it turns out
are getting smarter Three IQ points per  years going up Sort of an interesting thing With science dont think of skepticism
as a thing or science as a thing Are science and religion compatible Its like are science
and plumbing compatible Theyre just two different things Science is not a thing Its a verb Its a way of thinking about things Its a way of looking for natural
explanations for all phenomena I mean whats more likely that extraterrestrial intelligences
or multidimensional beings travel across vast distances
of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bobs
field in Puckerbrush Kansas to promote skepticcom our web page Or is it more likely that a reader
of Skeptic did this with Photoshop And in all cases we have to ask  Whats the more likely explanation Before we say something
is out of this world we should first make sure
that its not in this world Whats more likely that Arnold had extraterrestrial help
in his run for the governorship or that the World Weekly News
makes stuff up The same theme is expressed nicely
here in this Sidney Harris cartoon For those of you in the back
it says here Then a miracle occurs I think you need to be more
explicit here in step two This single slide completely dismantles
the intelligent design arguments Theres nothing more to it than that You can say a miracle occurs its just that it doesnt explain
anything or offer anything Theres nothing to test Its the end of the conversation
for intelligent design creationists And its true scientists sometimes throw
terms out as linguistic place fillers  dark energy or dark matter
something like that  until we figure out what it is
well call it this Its the beginning of the causal
chain for science For intelligent design creationists
its the end of the chain So again we can ask this
whats more likely Are UFOs alien spaceships or perceptual
cognitive mistakes or even fakes This is a UFO shot from my house
in Altadena California looking down over Pasadena And if it looks a lot like a Buick
hubcap its because it is You dont even need Photoshop
or hightech equipment you dont need computers This was shot with a throwaway
Kodak Instamatic camera You just have somebody off on the side
with a hubcap ready to go Cameras ready  thats it So although its possible
that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on
and that some of them are real its more likely that all of them
are fake like the crop circles On a more serious note in all of science
were looking for a balance between data and theory In the case of Galileo
he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn First of all there was no
theory of planetary rings Second of all his data
was grainy and fuzzy and he couldnt quite make out
what he was looking at So he wrote that he had seen  I have observed that the furthest
planet has three bodies And this is what he ended up
concluding that he saw So without a theory of planetary
rings and with only grainy data you cant have a good theory It wasnt solved until  This is Christiaan Huygenss book
that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out
what was going on with Saturn It wasnt till Huygens had two things He had a good theory of planetary rings
and how the solar system operated and he had better telescopic
more finegrain data in which he could figure out that
as the Earth is going around faster  according to Keplers Laws 
than Saturn then we catch up with it And we see the angles of the rings
at different angles there And that in fact turns out to be true The problem with having a theory is that
it may be loaded with cognitive biases So one of the problems of explaining
why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level and then Ill go to more serious ones Like we have a tendency to see faces This is the face on Mars In  where there was a whole movement
to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental
architecture made by Martians Heres the closeup of it from  If you squint you can still see the face And when youre squinting youre turning that from finegrain
to coarsegrain so youre reducing
the quality of your data And if I didnt tell you what to look for
youd still see the face because were programmed
by evolution to see faces Faces are important for us socially And of course happy faces
faces of all kinds are easy to see You see the happy face on Mars there If astronomers were frogs
perhaps theyd see Kermit the Frog Do you see him there Little froggy legs Or if geologists were elephants Religious iconography Discovered by a Tennessee baker in  He charged five bucks a head
to come see the nun bun till he got a ceaseanddesist
from Mother Teresas lawyer Heres Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our
Lady of Watsonville just down the street or is it up the street from here Tree bark is particularly good
because its nice and grainy branchy blackandwhite splotchy and you can
get the patternseeking  humans are patternseeking animals Heres the Virgin Mary on the side
of a glass window in Sao Paulo Heres when the Virgin Mary made
her appearance on a cheese sandwich  which I got to actually
hold in a Las Vegas casino  of course this being America This casino paid 
on eBay for the cheese sandwich But who does it really look like
The Virgin Mary It has that sort of
puckered lips sera look Virgin Mary in Clearwater Florida I actually went to see this one There was a lot of people there The faithful come in their wheelchairs
and crutches and so on We went down and investigated Just to give you a size thats Dawkins
me and The Amazing Randi next to this two
two and a half storysized image All these candles thousands of candles
people had lit in tribute to this So we walked around the backside
to see what was going on It turns out wherever theres
a sprinkler head and a palm tree you get the effect Heres the Virgin Mary on the backside
which they started to wipe off I guess you can only have
one miracle per building So is it really a miracle of Mary
or is it a miracle of Marge And now Im going to finish up
with another example of this with auditory illusions Theres this film White Noise
with Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to us By the way the whole business of talking
to the dead is not that big a deal Anybody can do it turns out Its getting the dead to talk
back thats the really hard part In this case supposedly these messages
are hidden in electronic phenomena Theres a ReverseSpeechcom web page
where I downloaded this stuff This is the most famous one
of all of these Heres the forward version
of the very famous song Music with lyrics If theres a bustle in your hedgerow
dont be alarmed now Its just a spring clean
for the May Queen Yes there are two paths you
can go by but in the long run Theres still time to change
the road youre on Music ends Couldnt you just listen to that all day All right here it is backwards and see if you can hear the hidden
messages that are supposedly in there Music with unintelligible lyrics Lyrics Satan Unintelligible lyrics continue What did you get
Audience Satan Satan OK at least we got Satan Now Ill prime the auditory
part of your brain to tell you what youre supposed
to hear and then hear it again Music with lyrics Music ends You cant miss it
when I tell you whats there Im going to just end
with a positive nice little story The Skeptics is a nonprofit
educational organization Were always looking for little
good things that people do And in England theres a pop singer One of the top popular singers
in England today Katie Melua And she wrote a beautiful song It was in the top five in  called
Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing Its a love story  shes sort
of the Norah Jones of the UK  about how she much loves her guy and compared to nine million
bicycles and so forth And she has this one passage here Music Lyrics We are  billion
lightyears from the edge Thats a guess No one can ever say its true But I know that I will always be with you Michael Shermer Well thats nice
At least she got it close In America itd be
Were  light years from the edge But my friend Simon Singh the particle
physicist now turned science educator who wrote the book
The Big Bang and so on uses every chance he gets
to promote good science And so he wrote an oped piece
in The Guardian about Katies song in which he said well we know exactly
how far from the edge You know its  billion light years
and its not a guess We know within precise
error bars how close it is So we can say although not absolutely
true its pretty close to being true And to his credit Katie called him up
after this oped piece came out and said Im so embarrassed
I was in the astronomy club I shouldve known better And she recut the song So I will end with the new version Music with lyrics We are  billion light years from the edge of the observable universe Thats a good estimate
with welldefined error bars And with the available information I predict that I will always be with you How cool is that ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

23,I love trees and Im very lucky because we live near a wonderful arboretum and Sundays usually Id go there with my wife and now with my fouryearold and wed climb in the trees wed play hide and seek The second school I was at had big trees too had a fantastic tulip tree I think it was the biggest in the country and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it around the playing fields One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates and taken in the bushes  I was stripped I was attacked I was abused and this came out of the blue Now the reason I say that because afterwards I was thinking  well I went back into the school  I felt dirty I felt betrayed I felt ashamed but mainly  mainly I felt powerless And  years later I was sitting in an airplane next to a lady called Veronica who came from Chile and we were on a human rights tour and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured and from my very privileged position this was the only reference point that I had And it was an amazing learning experience because for me human rights have been something in which I had you know a parttime interest but mainly it was something that happened to other people over there But I got a phone call from Bono in  and as you know hes a great singer but hes a magnificent hustler and  Laughter  a very hard guy to say no to and he was saying you know just after Id done the Biko song were going to do a tour for Amnesty you have to be on it and really that was the first time that Id been out and started meeting people whod watched their family being shot in front of them whod had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world and I couldnt really walk away in quite the same way as before So I got involved with this tour which was for Amnesty and then in  I took over Bonos job trying to learn how to hustle I didnt do it as well but we managed to get Youssou NDour Sting Tracy Chapman and Bruce Springsteen to go round the world for Amnesty and it was an amazing experience And once again I got an extraordinary education and it was the first time really that Id met a lot of these people in the different countries and these human rights stories became very physical and again I couldnt really walk away quite so comfortably But the thing that really amazed me that I had no idea was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience your story denied buried and forgotten And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around or a video or film camera it was a great deal harder to do  for those in power to bury the story And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then  well we made a proposal for a couple of years about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists It didnt really get anywhere and then the Rodney King incident happened and people thought OK if you have a camera in the right place at the right time or perhaps the wrong time depending who you are then you can actually start doing something and campaigning and being heard and telling people about whats going on So WITNESS was started in  and its since given cameras out in over  countries And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and in fact I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns and Im afraid its a story from Uganda and although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday this one isnt quite so good In the north of Uganda there are something like  million internally displaced people people who are not refugees in another country but because of the civil war which has been going on for about  years they have nowhere to live And  kids have been taken away to become child soldiers and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the  now whats it called I forget the name of the of the army  its Lords Resistance Army I believe  but the government also doesnt have a clean sheet so if we could run the first video Music Woman Life in the camp is never simple Even today life is difficult We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp  still exists back home Text Between Two Fires Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda Man When we were at home it was Konys rebel soldiers disturbing us At first we were safe in the camp But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot Chanting Jennifer A soldier walked onto the road asking where wed been Evelyn and I hid behind my mother Evelyn He ordered us to sit down so we sat down The other soldier also came Jennifer The man came and started undressing me The other one carried Evelyn aside The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also Man The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession They kept telling us Tell the truth as they beat us Woman They insisted that I was lying At that moment they fired and shot off my fingers I fell They ran to join the others  leaving me for dead Music Text Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in  Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession to punish coerce or intimidate Peter Gabriel So torture is not something that always happens on other soil In my country it was  we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis weve got Abu Ghraib weve got Guantanamo Bay I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport and he told me a story that in the middle of the night  am hed been taken out of his home in Queens  taken to a place in the Midwest that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later because he had the same  he was Middle Eastern and he had the same name as one of the  pilots and that may or may not be true  I didnt think he was a liar though And I think if we look around the world as well as the polar ice caps melting human rights which have been fought for for many hundreds of years in some cases are also eroding very fast and that is something that we need to take a look at and maybe start campaigning for I mean here too one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project  they have managed with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed and its much  much  I think more humane methods are being looked at how you should lock up young kids and thats questionable to start off And as the story of Mr Morales just down the road excuse me Mr Gabriel would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit No not at all no problem take your time But this surely whoever that man is whatever hes done this is cruel and unusual punishment Anyway WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world with cameras and Id like to show you just a little more of that Thank you Thunder Text You can say a story is fabricated Music Text You can say a jury is corrupt You can say a person is lying You can say you dont trust newspapers But you cant say what you just saw never happened Help WITNESS give cameras to the world Shoot a video expose injustice reveal the truth show us whats wrong with the world and maybe we can help make it right WITNESS All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS PG WITNESS was born of technological innovation  in a sense the small portable DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being And weve also been trying to get computers out to the world so that groups can communicate much more effectively campaign much more effectively but now we have the wonderful possibility which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it because that is cheap its ubiquitous and its moving fast all around the world  and its very exciting for us And so the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded being seen being watched that they really know that they can be heard that there would be a giant website maybe a little like Google Earth and you could fly over and find out the realities of whats going for the worlds inhabitants In a way what this technology is allowing is really that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face that we can actually see whos dying of AIDS or whos being beaten up for the first time and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture  if we can move that into these sort of fields I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways There could be a new movement growing up rising from the ground reaching for the light and growing strong just like a tree Thank

25,"Im Rich Baraniuk and what Id like
to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think
have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been
talked about the last two days So many different points of resonance that its going to be difficult
to bring them all up but Ill try to do my best Does anybody remember these OK so these are LP records
and theyve been replaced right Theyve been swept away
over the last two decades by these types of worldflattening
digitization technologies right And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music
as we came in the room today Whats happened in the music world
is theres a culture or an ecosystem thats been created that if you take some words from Apple the catchphrase 
that we create rip mix and burn What I mean by that is that anyone
in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas Anyone in the world is allowed
to rip or copy musical ideas use them in innovative ways Anyone is allowed to mix them
in different types of ways draw connections between musical ideas and people can burn them or create
final products and continue the circle And what thats done
is its created like I said a vibrant community thats very inclusive with people continually working
to connect musical ideas innovate them and keep things
constantly up to date Todays hit single
is not last years hit single But Im not here
to talk about music today Im here to talk about books In particular textbooks
and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school Has anyone here ever been to school OK does anybody realize
theres a crisis in our schools around the world Im not going to spend
too much time on that but what I want to talk about
is some of the disconnects that appear when an author
publishes a book That in fact the publishing process  just because of the fact
that its complicated its heavy books are expensive  creates a sort of a wall
between authors of books and the ultimate users of books be they teachers students
or just general readers And this is even more true
if you happen to speak a language other than one of the worlds
major languages and especially English Im going to call these people
below the barrier shutouts because theyre really
shut out of the process of being able to share
their knowledge with the world And so what I want to talk about today
is trying to take these ideas that weve seen in the musical culture and try to bring these
towards reinventing the way we think about writing books
using them and teaching from them So thats what Id like to talk about and really how we get
from where we are now to where we need to go The first thing Id like you to do
is a little thought experiment Imagine taking all the worlds books OK everybody imagine books
and imagine just tearing out the pages So liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them
and then storing them in a vast interconnected
global repository Think of it as a massive iTunes
for booktype content And then take that material
and imagine making it all open so that people can modify it
play with it improve it Imagine making it free so that anyone in the world can have
access to all of this knowledge and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content
improve it play with it on a timescale thats more
on the order of seconds instead of years Instead of editions of a book
coming out every two years imagine them coming out every  seconds So imagine we could do that
and imagine we could put people into this So that we could truly build
an ecosystem with not just authors but all the people
who could be or want to be authors in all the different
languages of the world and I think if you could do this
it would be called  Im just going to refer to it
as a knowledge ecosystem So really this is the dream and in a sense what you can think of it is were trying
to enable anyone in the world I mean anyone in the world  to be their own educational DJ creating educational materials
sharing them with the world constantly innovating on them So this is the dream In fact this dream
is actually being realized Over the last sixandahalf years weve been working really hard
at Rice University on a project called Connexions and so what Id like to do
for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing
with Connexions which you can kind of
think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negropontes talk yesterday where theyre working on the hardware
of bringing education to the world Were working on the opensource tools and the content So thats sort of
to put it in perspective here So create What are some of the people
that are using these kind of tools Well the first thing is theres a community
of engineering professors from Cambridge to Kyoto who are developing engineering content
in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of
as a massive super textbook that covers the entire area
of electrical engineering And not only that  it can be customized for use in each
of their own individual institutions If people like Kitty Jones a shutout  a private music teacher and mom
from Champagne Illinois who wanted to share her fantastic
music content with the world on how to teach kids how to play music  Her material is now used
over  times per month Tremendous use In fact a lot of this use coming
from United States K schools because anyone whos involved
in a school scale back the first thing thats cut
is the music curriculum And so this is just indicating
the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free content A lot of teachers are using this stuff What about ripping
What about copying reusing A team of volunteers
at the University of Texas at El Paso  graduate students translating
this engineering super textbook ideas And within about a week having this be some
of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America
and in particular in Mexico because of the open
extensible nature of this People volunteers and even companies that are translating materials
into Asian languages like Chinese Japanese and Thai to spread the knowledge even further OK what about people who are mixing What does mixing mean Mixing means
building customized courses means building customized books Companies like National Instruments who are embedding very powerful
interactive simulations into the materials so that we can go way beyond
our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials
are things you can actually interact with and play around with
and actually learn as you do Weve been working
with Teachers Without Borders who are very interested
in mixing our materials Theyre going to be using
Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials
for teaching teachers how to teach in  countries around the world TWB is currently in Iraq training  teachers
supported by USAID And to them this idea
of being able to remix and customize to the local context
is extraordinarily important because just providing
free content to people has actually been likened
by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism  that if you dont empower people with the ability
to recontextualize the material translate it into their own language
and take ownership of it its not good OK other organizations
weve been working with UC Merced  people know about UC Merced Its a new university in California
in the Central Valley working very closely
with community colleges Theyre actually developing a lot of their science
and engineering curriculum to spread widely
around the world in our system And theyre also trying to develop
all of their software tools completely opensource Weve been working with AMD
which has a project called x which is trying to bring
Internet connectivity to  percent of the worlds
population by  Were going to be
providing content to them in a whole range of different languages And weve also been working
with a number of other organizations In particular a bunch of the projects
that are funded by Hewlett Foundation who have taken a real leadership role
in this area of open content OK burn  I think
this is sort of quite interesting Burn is the idea of trying
to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses And I think a lot of you received  I think all of you received one
of these music books in your gift pack A little present for you Just to tell you quickly about it
this is an engineering textbook Its about  pages long hardbound This costs  anybody guess How much would it cost in a bookstore Audience  dollars Richard Baraniuk
OK This costs  dollars to the student Why does it cost  dollars Because its published on demand and its developed
from this repository of open materials If this book were to be published
by a regular publisher it would cost at least  dollars So what were seeing is moving this burning
or publication process from the regular
sort of singleauthored book towards communityauthored materials that are modular that are customized
to each individual class and published on demand
very inexpensively either pushed out through Amazon or published directly
through an ondemand press like QOOP And I think that this is
an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area
under this long tail in publishing Were not talking
about the Harry Potter end right at the left side Were talking about books on hypergeometric
partial differential equations Books that might sell
 copies a year  copies a year There is tremendous
sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours but also to sustain this new emergence
of ondemand publishers like QOOP who produced these two books And I think one of the things
that you should take away from this talk is that theres an impending
cutoutthemiddleman disintermediation thats going to be happening
in the publishing industry And its going to reach a crescendo
over the next few years and I think that its for our benefit
really and for the worlds benefit OK so what are the enablers Whats really making all of this happen Theres tons of technology and the only piece of technology
that I really want to talk about is XML How many people know about XML Oh great So its the future of the web right Its semantic representation of content And what you can really
think of XML in this case is its the packaging
that were putting around these pages Remember we took the book
tore the pages out Well what the XML is going to do is its going to turn those pages
into Lego blocks XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content
together in a myriad different ways and it provides us a framework
to share content So it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state
of all this content all the pages youve torn out of books and create highly sophisticated
learning machines books courses course packs It gives you the ability
to personalize the learning experience to each individual student so that every student
can have a book or a course thats customized to their
learning style their context their language and the things
that excite them It lets you reuse the same materials
in multiple different ways and surprising new ways It lets you interconnect ideas indicating how fields
relate to each other And Ill just give you my personal story We came up with this
sixandahalf years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box And my day job as Chris said 
Im an electrical engineering professor I teach signal processing and my challenge
was to show that this math  Wow about half of you
have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation But this seemingly dry math is actually the center
of this tremendously powerful web that links technology  that links really cool applications
like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities but also governed
by intellectual property And the thing that I realized is there was no way
that I as an engineer could write this book
that would get all of this across We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools
to be able to interconnect these ideas And I think that really
in a sense what were trying to do is make Minskys dream come to a reality where you can imagine
all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other And people who are teachers out here 
whoever taught you know this  its the interconnections between ideas
that teaching is really all about OK back to math Imagine  this is possible that every single equation that you
click on in one of your new etexts is something that youre going to be able
to explore and experiment with So imagine your kids
algebra textbook in seventh grade You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool
to be able to experiment with it tinker with it understand it Because we really
dont understand until we do The same type of markup
like MathML for chemistry Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure
of how molecules are formed Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve
into the semantic structure of music play with it understand it Its no wonder that everybodys
getting into it right Even the three wise men OK the second big enabler
and this is where I told a big lie The second big enabler
is intellectual property Because in fact I got up here and I talked about how great
the music culture is We can share and rip mix and burn
but in fact thats all illegal And we would be accused
of piracy for doing that because this music has been propertized Its now owned
much of it by big industries So really the key thing here
is we cant let this happen We cant let this
Napster thing happen here So what we have to do
is get it right from the very beginning And what we have to do
is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe
and makes it easily understandable And the inspiration here
is taken from opensource software Things like Linux and the GPL The Creative Commons licenses How many people
have heard of creative commons If you have not you must learn about it Creativecommonsorg At the bottom of every piece
of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects you can find their logo Clicking on that logo
takes you to an absolute nononsense humanreadable document a deed that tells you exactly
what you can do with this content In fact youre free to share it
to do all of these things to copy it to change it
even to make commercial use of it as long as you attribute the author Because in academic publishing
and much of educational publishing its really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact Thats why people write
not necessarily making bucks Were not talking
about Harry Potter right Were at the long tail end here Behind that is the legal code
very carefully constructed And Creative Commons is taking off  over  million things out there licensed with a Creative Commons license Not just text but music images video And theres actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people
that are actually licensing music to make it free for people
who do this whole idea of resampling ripping mixing burning and sharing OK Id like to conclude
with just the last few points So weve built this idea of a commons People are using it We get over  unique visitors
per month just to our particular site MIT OpenCourseWare
which is another large opencontent site gets a similar number of hits But how do we protect this How do we protect it into the future And the first thing
that people are probably thinking is quality control right Because were saying that anybody
can contribute things to this commons Anybody can contribute anything So that could be a problem It didnt take long until people
started contributing materials for example on lingerie which is actually a pretty good module The only problem is its plagiarized
from a major French feminist journal and when you go
to the supposed course website it points to a lingerieselling website So this is a little bit of a problem So we clearly need some kind
of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea
of review and peer review comes in You come to TED Why do you come to TED Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are
very very high quality right And so we need to be able
to do the same thing And we need to be able
to design structures and what were doing
is designing social software to enable anyone to build
their own peer review process and we call these things lenses And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop
their own peerreview process so that they can focus
on the content in the repository that they think is really important And you can think of TED
as a potential lens So Id just like to end by saying you can really view this
as a call to action Connexions and open content
is all about sharing knowledge All of you here are tremendously imbued
with tremendous amounts of knowledge and what Id like to do
is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project
and other projects of its type because I think together
we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing So thanks very much ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

27,"My name is Lovegrove I only know nine Lovegroves
two of which are my parents They are first cousins and you know
what happens when you know  So theres a terribly weird
freaky side to me which Im fighting with all the time So to try and get through today Ive kind of disciplined myself
with an minute talk I was hanging on to have a pee I thought perhaps
if I was hanging on long enough that would guide me
through the  minutes OK I am known as Captain Organic and thats a philosophical position
as well as an aesthetic position But today what Id like to talk
to you about is that love of form and how form can touch
peoples soul and emotion Not very long ago
not many thousands of years ago we actually lived in caves and I dont think
weve lost that coding system We respond so well to form But Im interested
in creating intelligent form Im not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish
that you see coming out as design This artificially induced
consumerism  I think its atrocious My world is the world
of people like Amory Lovins Janine Benyus James Watson Im in that world
but I work purely instinctively Im not a scientist
I could have been perhaps but I work in this world
where I trust my instincts So I am a stcentury
translator of technology into products that we use everyday
and relate beautifully and naturally with And we should be developing things 
we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate
peoples perceptions and respect for the things
that we dig out of the earth and translate into products
for everyday use So the water bottle Ill begin with this concept
of what I call DNA DNA Design Nature Art These are the three things
that condition my world Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci
 years ago before photography It shows how observation
curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art Industrial design is the art form
of the st century People like Leonardo 
there have not been many  had this amazingly instinctive curiosity I work from a similar position I dont want to sound
pretentious saying that but this is my drawing made
on a digital pad a couple of years ago  well into the st century
 years later Its my impression of water Impressionism being the most valuable
art form on the planet as we know it  million dollars easily for a Monet I use now a whole new process A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn
Thom Mayne Zaha Hadid Rem Koolhaas  all these people that I think
are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas
of how to create form This is all created digitally Here you see the machining
the milling of a block of acrylic This is what I show to the client to say
Thats what I want to do At that point I dont know
if thats possible at all Its a seductor but I just feel
in my bones that thats possible So we go we look at the tooling We look at how that is produced These are the invisible things
that you never see in your life This is the background noise
of industrial design That is like an Anish Kapoor
flowing through a Richard Serra It is more valuable
than the product in my eyes I dont have one When I do make some money
Ill have one machined for myself This is the final product When they sent it to me
I thought Id failed It felt like nothing
It has to feel like nothing It was when I put the water in that I realized that Id put
a skin on water itself Its an icon of water itself and it elevates peoples perception
of contemporary design Each bottle is different meaning the water level
will give you a different shape Its mass individualism
from a single product It fits the hand It fits arthritic hands
It fits childrens hands It makes the product strong
the tessellation Its a millefiori of ideas In the future they will look like that because we need to move away
from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things
perhaps in life Biopolymers these new
ideas for materials will come into play in probably a decade It doesnt look as cool does it But I can live up to that
I dont have a problem with that I design for that condition
biopolymers Its the future I took this video in Cape Town last year This is the freaky side coming out I have this special interest
in things like this which blow my mind I dont know whether to
you know drop to my knees cry I dont know what I think But I just know that nature  nature improves with evergreater purpose that which once existed and that strangeness
is a consequence of innovative thinking When I look at these things
they look pretty normal to me But these things evolved over many years
and what were trying to do  I get three weeks to design a telephone
How the hell do I do that when you get these things that take
hundreds of millions of years to evolve How do you condense that It comes back to instinct Im not talking about designing
telephones that look like that and Im not looking
at designing architecture like that Im just interested
in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms
that only nature really creates How that flows through me
and how that comes out is what Im trying to understand This is a scan through the human forearm Its then blown up
through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure I have these in my office My office is a mixture
of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab Its a weird kind of freaky place This is one of my specimens This is made  bone is made from a mixture
of inorganic minerals and polymers I studied cooking in school
for four years and in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me
to try and get a science qualification Actually I put marijuana
in everything I cooked  And I had access to all
the best girls It was fabulous All the guys in the rugby team
couldnt understand Anyway  this is a meringue This is another sample I have A meringue is made exactly the same way
in my estimation as a bone Its made from
polysaccharides and proteins If you pour water on that it dissolves Could we be manufacturing
from foodstuffs in the future Not a bad idea I dont know I need to talk to Janine
and a few other people about that but I believe instinctively that
that meringue can become something a car  I dont know Im also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things so youre not restricted by form at all These interrelated forms
they do inspire everything I do although I might end up
making something incredibly simple This is a detail of a chair
that Ive designed in magnesium It shows this interlocution of elements
and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking shown pretty much as a bone structure Any one of those elements
you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object Its the worlds first chair
made in magnesium It cost  million dollars to develop Its called Go by Bernhardt USA It went into Time magazine in 
as the new language of the st century Boy For somebody growing up in Wales
in a little village thats enough It shows how you make one holistic form
like the car industry and then you break up what you need This is an absolutely
beautiful way of working Its a godly way of working Its organic and its essential Its an absolutely fatfree design and when you look at it
you see human beings When that moves into polymers you can change the elasticity
the fluidity of the form This is an idea for a gasinjected
onepiece polymer chair What nature does
is it drills holes in things It liberates form It takes away anything extraneous Thats what I do I make organic things which are essential And they look funky too 
but I dont set out to make funky things because I think
thats an absolute disgrace I set out to look at natural forms If you took the idea of fractal technology
further take a membrane shrinking it down constantly
like nature does  that could be a seat for a chair It could be a sole for a sports shoe It could be a car blending into seats Wow Lets go for it
Thats the kind of stuff This is what exists in nature Observation now allows us
to bring that natural process into the design process every day Thats what I do This is a show
thats currently on in Tokyo Its called Superliquidity
Its my sculptural investigation Its like stcentury Henry Moore When you see a Henry Moore still
your hair stands up Theres some amazing spiritual connect If he was a car designer
phew wed all be driving one In his day he was
the highest taxpayer in Britain That is the power of organic design It contributes immensely to our  sense of being our sense of relationships with things our sensuality and
you know the sort of  even the sort of socioerotic side
which is very important This is my artwork
This is all my process These actually are sold as artwork
Theyre very big prints But this is how I get to that object Ironically that object was made
by the Killarney process which is a brandnew process here
for the st century and I can hear Greg Lynn
laughing his socks off as I say that Ill tell you about that later When I look into these data images I see new things Its selfinspired Diatomic structures radiolaria the things that we couldnt see
but we can do now  these again are cored out Theyre made virtually from nothing
Theyre made from silica Why not structures from cars like that Coral all these natural forces take away what they dont need
and they deliver maximum beauty We need to be in that realm I want to do stuff like that This is a new chair which should
come on the market in September Its for a company called Moroso in Italy
Its a gasinjected polymer chair Those holes you see there
are very filtereddown watereddown versions of the extremity
of the diatomic structures It goes with the flow
of the polymer and youll see  theres an image coming up
right now that shows the full thing Its great to have companies in Italy
who support this way of dreaming If you see the shadows
that come through that theyre actually probably
more important than the product but its the minimum it takes The coring out of the back
lets you breathe It takes away any material you dont need and it actually garners flexure too I was going to break into a dance then This is some current work Im doing Im looking at singlesurface structures and how they stretch and flow Its based on furniture typologies
but thats not the end motivation Its made from aluminum  as opposed to aluminium and its grown Its grown in my mind and then its grown in terms
of the whole process that I go through This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry
who build parts for Bentleys and so on Its being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips
next year in New York I have a big show
with Phillips Auctioneers When I see these animations
oh Jesus Im blown away This is what goes on
in my studio everyday I walk  Im traveling I come back Some guys got that on a computer 
theres this like oh my goodness So I try to create this energy
of invention every day in my studio This kind of effervescent  fully charged sense of soup
that delivers ideas Singlesurface products Furnitures a good one How you grow legs out of a surface I would love to build this one day and perhaps Id like
to build it also out of flour sugar polymer wood chips 
I dont know human hair I dont know Id love a go at that
I dont know If I just got some time Thats the weird side coming out again
A lot of companies dont understand that Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo They said Give us the dream
What is our dream How do we beat Apple I said You dont copy Apple
thats for sure You get into biopolymers They looked straight through me What a waste Anyway No its true Fuck them
You know I mean  Im delivering theyre not taking Ive had this image  years Ive had this image of a water droplet
for  years sitting on a hot bed That is an image of a car for me Thats the car of the future
Its a water droplet Ive been banging on about this
like I cant believe Cars are all wrong Im going to show you
something a bit weird now They laughed everywhere
over the world I showed this The only place
that didnt laugh was Moscow Cars are made from  components How ridiculous is that
Couldnt you make that from  Its got a vacuumformed
carbonnylon pan Everythings holistically integrated
It opens and closes like a bread bin There is no engine
Theres a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels
theyre fitted like Formula  You take them off your wall
you plug them in Off you go A threewheeled car slow feminine transparent so you can see
the people in there You drive different You see that thing You do You do And not anesthetized separated from life Theres a hole at the front
and theres a reason for that Its a city car
You drive along You get out You drive on to a proboscis You get out It lifts you up It presents the solar panel to the sun
and at night its a street lamp Thats what happens if you get inspired
by the street lamp first and do the car second I can see these bubbles
with these hydrogen packages floating around
on the ground driven by AI When I showed this in South Africa everybody afterwards was going
Hey car on a stick Like this Can you imagine A car on a stick If you put it next to
contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me And thats what I do with my furniture Im not putting Charles Eames
furniture in buildings anymore Im trying to build furniture
which fits architecture Im trying to build
transportation systems I work on aircraft for Airbus I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural
inspiredbynature dreams home Im going to finish on two things This is the stereolithography
of a staircase Its a little bit of a dedication
to James James Watson I built this thing for my studio It cost me  dollars to build this Most people go and buy the Aston Martin I built this This is the data that goes with that
Incredibly complex Took about two years
because Im looking for fatfree design Lean efficient things Healthy products This is built by composites Its a single element which rotates around
to create a holistic element and this is a carbonfiber handrail
which is only supported in two places Modern materials
allow us to do modern things This is a shot in the studio This is how it looks
pretty much every day You wouldnt want to have
a fear of heights coming down it There is virtually no handrail
It doesnt pass any standards Who cares And it has an internal handrail
which gives it its strength Its this holistic integration
Thats my studio Its subterranean Its in Notting Hill
next to all the crap  the prostitutes and all that stuff Its next to David Hockneys
original studio It has a lighting system
that changes throughout the day My guys go out for lunch
The doors open They come back in because its normally raining
and they prefer to stay in This is my studio Elephant skull
from Oxford University  I bought that last year
Theyre very difficult to find If anybodys got a whale skeleton
they want to sell me Ill put it in the studio So Im just going
to interject a little bit with some of the things
that youll see in the video Its a homemade video made it myself
at three oclock in the morning just to show you how my real world is You never see that You never see architects or designers
showing you their real world This is called a Plasnet Its a new biopolycarbonate chair
Im doing in Italy Worlds first bamboo bike
with folding handlebars We should all be riding one of these As China buys all these crappy cars
we should be riding things like this Counterbalance Like I say its a cross between Natural History Museum
and a NASA laboratory Its full of prototypes and objects Its selfinspirational again I mean the rare times when Im there I do enjoy it And I get lots and lots of kids coming Im a contaminator for all those children
of investment bankers  wankers Sorry Thats a solar seed
Its a concept for new architecture That thing on the top is the worlds
first solarpowered garden lamp  the first produced Giles Revell should be
talking here today  amazing photography
of things you cant see The first sculptural model
I made for that thing in Tokyo Lots of stuff
Theres a little leaf chair  that golden looking thing
is called Leaf Its made from Kevlar On the wall is my book
called Supernatural which allows me to remember
what Ive done because I forget Theres an aerated brick
I did in Limoges last year in Concepts for New Ceramics
in Architecture Gernot Oberfell working
at three oclock in the morning  and I dont pay overtime Overtime is the passion of design so join the club or dont No its true People like Tom and Greg  were traveling like you cant 
we fit it all in I dont know how we do it Next week Im at Electrolux in Sweden
then Im in Beijing on Friday You work that one out And when I see Eds photographs
I think why the hell am I going to China Its true Its true Because theres a soul
in this whole thing We need to have a new instinct
for the st century We need to combine all this stuff If all the people who were
talking over this period worked on a car together it would be a joy absolute joy So theres a new Xlight system
Im doing in Japan Theres Tuareg shoes from North Africa
Theres a Kifwebe mask These are my sculptures A copper jelly mold It sounds like some quiz show
or something doesnt it So its going to end Thank you James
for your great inspiration Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

28,"Im going to give you
four specific examples Im going to cover at the end about how a company called Silk
tripled their sales how an artist named Jeff Koons
went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money
and having a lot of impact to how Frank Gehry redefined
what it meant to be an architect And one of my biggest failures
as a marketer in the last few years  a record label I started
that had a CD called Sauce Before I can do that
Ive got to tell you about sliced bread and a guy named Otto Rohwedder Now before sliced bread
was invented in the s I wonder what they said Like the greatest invention
since the telegraph or something But this guy named Otto Rohwedder
invented sliced bread and he focused like most inventors did
on the patent part and the making part And the thing about the invention
of sliced bread is this  that for the first  years
after sliced bread was available no one bought it no one knew about it it was a complete and total failure And the reason
is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread
the idea of sliced bread no one wanted it That the success of sliced bread like the success of almost everything
weve talked about at this conference is not always about what the patent
is like or what the factory is like  its about can you get
your idea to spread or not And I think that the way
youre going to get what you want or cause the change that you want
to change to happen is to figure out a way
to get your ideas to spread And it doesnt matter to me
whether youre running a coffee shop or youre an intellectual
or youre in business or youre flying hot air balloons I think that all this stuff applies
to everybody regardless of what we do That what we are living in
is a century of idea diffusion That people who can spread ideas
regardless of what those ideas are win When I talk about it
I usually pick business because they make the best pictures
that you can put in your presentation and because its the easiest
sort of way to keep score But I want you to forgive me
when I use these examples because Im talking about anything
that you decide to spend your time to do At the heart of spreading ideas
is TV and stuff like TV TV and mass media made it really easy
to spread ideas in a certain way I call it the TVindustrial complex The way the TVindustrial complex works
is you buy some ads interrupt some people
that gets you distribution You use the distribution you get
to sell more products You take the profit
from that to buy more ads And it goes around and around and around the same way that the militaryindustrial
complex worked a long time ago That model of
and we heard it yesterday  if we could only get
onto the homepage of Google if we could only figure out
how to get promoted there or grab that person by the throat and tell them about what we want to do If we did that then everyone would pay
attention and we would win Well this TVindustrial complex informed
my entire childhood and probably yours I mean all of these products succeeded
because someone figured out how to touch people in a way
they werent expecting in a way they didnt
necessarily want with an ad over and over again until they bought it And the thing thats happened is
they canceled the TVindustrial complex That just over the last few years what anybody who markets
anything has discovered is that its not working
the way that it used to This picture is really fuzzy I apologize
I had a bad cold when I took it But the product in the blue box
in the center is my poster child I go to the deli Im sick
I need to buy some medicine The brand manager for that blue product
spent  million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year  million dollars interrupting me
with TV commercials and magazine ads and Spam and coupons and shelving
allowances and spiff  all so I could ignore
every single message And I ignored every message because I dont have
a pain reliever problem I buy the stuff in the yellow box
because I always have And Im not going to invest a minute
of my time to solve her problem because I dont care Heres a magazine called Hydrate
Its  pages about water Articles about water ads about water Imagine what the world
was like  years ago with just the Saturday Evening Post
and Time and Newsweek Now there are magazines about water New product from Coke Japan water salad Coke Japan comes out
with a new product every three weeks because they have no idea
whats going to work and whats not I couldnt have written
this better myself It came out four days ago  I circled the important parts
so you can see them here Theyve come out Arbys is going to spend
 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold hoping that that will get people to go
to Arbys and buy a roast beef sandwich Now I had tried to imagine what could
possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold
that would get you to get in your car drive across town
and buy a roast beef sandwich Now this is Copernicus and he was right when he was talking to anyone
who needs to hear your idea The world revolves around me Me me me me My favorite person  me I dont want to get email
from anybody I want to get memail So consumers and I dont just mean
people who buy stuff at the Safeway I mean people at the Defense Department
who might buy something or people at you know the New Yorker
who might print your article Consumers dont care about you
at all they just dont care Part of the reason is  theyve got
way more choices than they used to and way less time And in a world where we have
too many choices and too little time the obvious thing to do
is just ignore stuff And my parable here
is youre driving down the road and you see a cow and you keep driving
because youve seen cows before Cows are invisible Cows are boring Whos going to stop and pull over
and say  Oh look a cow Nobody But if the cow was purple 
isnt that a great special effect I could do that again if you want If the cow was purple
youd notice it for a while I mean if all cows were purple
youd get bored with those too The thing thats going to decide
what gets talked about what gets done what gets changed what gets purchased what gets built is Is it remarkable And remarkable is a really cool word because we think it just means neat but it also means
worth making a remark about And that is the essence
of where idea diffusion is going That two of the hottest cars
in the United States is a dollar giant car big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk People are paying full price for both and the only thing they have in common is that they dont have
anything in common Every week the number one
bestselling DVD in America changes Its never The Godfather
its never Citizen Kane its always some thirdrate movie
with some secondrate star But the reason its number one
is because thats the week it came out Because its new because its fresh People saw it and said
I didnt know that was there and they noticed it Two of the big success stories
of the last  years in retail  one sells things that are
superexpensive in a blue box and one sells things that are
as cheap as they can make them The only thing they have in common
is that theyre different Were now in the fashion business
no matter what we do for a living were in the fashion business And people in the fashion business know what its like to be in the fashion
business  theyre used to it The rest of us have to figure out
how to think that way How to understand that its not about interrupting
people with big fullpage ads or insisting on meetings with people But its a totally different
sort of process that determines which ideas spread
and which ones dont They sold a billion dollars
worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing
what it meant to sell a chair They turned a chair from something
the purchasing department bought to something that was a status symbol
about where you sat at work This guy Lionel Poil�ne
the most famous baker in the world  he died two and a half months ago and he was a hero of mine
and a dear friend He lived in Paris Last year he sold  million dollars
worth of French bread Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned by one baker at a time
in a woodfired oven And when Lionel started his bakery
the French poohpoohed it They didnt want to buy his bread It didnt look like French bread It wasnt what they expected It was neat it was remarkable and slowly it spread
from one person to another person until finally it became the official
bread of threestar restaurants in Paris Now hes in London and he ships
by FedEx all around the world What marketers used to do is make
average products for average people Thats what mass marketing is Smooth out the edges go for the center
thats the big market They would ignore the geeks
and God forbid the laggards It was all about going for the center But in a world where
the TVindustrial complex is broken I dont think thats a strategy
we want to use any more I think the strategy we want to use
is to not market to these people because theyre really good
at ignoring you But market to these
people because they care These are the people
who are obsessed with something And when you talk to them theyll listen because they like listening 
its about them And if youre lucky theyll tell
their friends on the rest of the curve and itll spread Itll spread to the entire curve They have something I call otaku 
its a great Japanese word It describes the desire
of someone whos obsessed to say drive across Tokyo to try
a new ramen noodle place because thats what they do
they get obsessed with it To make a product to market an idea to come up with any problem
you want to solve that doesnt have
a constituency with an otaku is almost impossible Instead you have to find
a group that really desperately cares about what it is you have to say Talk to them and make it easy
for them to tell their friends Theres a hot sauce otaku
but theres no mustard otaku Thats why theres lots and lots
of kinds of hot sauces and not so many kinds of mustard Not because its hard
to make interesting mustard  you could make interesting mustard  but people dont
because no ones obsessed with it and thus no one tells their friends Krispy Kreme has figured
this whole thing out It has a strategy and what they do is they enter a city they talk
to the people with the otaku and then they spread through the city to the people whove just
crossed the street This yoyo right here cost  dollars
but it sleeps for  minutes Not everybody wants it
but they dont care They want to talk to the people
who do and maybe itll spread These guys make the loudest
car stereo in the world Its as loud as a  jet You cant get in
the cars got bulletproof glass because itll blow out
the windshield otherwise But the fact remains that when someone wants to put
a couple of speakers in their car if theyve got the otaku
or theyve heard from someone who does they go ahead and they pick this Its really simple  you sell
to the people who are listening and just maybe
those people tell their friends So when Steve Jobs talks
to  people at his keynote who are all tuned in from  countries watching his twohour commercial  thats the only thing keeping
his company in business  its that those  people
care desperately enough to watch a twohour commercial
and then tell their friends Pearl Jam  albums released
in the last two years Every one made a profit How They only sell them on their website Those people who buy them have the otaku and then they tell their friends
and it spreads and it spreads This hospital crib cost  dollars
 times the standard But hospitals are buying it
faster than any other model Hard Candy nail polish
doesnt appeal to everybody but to the people who love it
they talk about it like crazy This paint can right here saved
the Dutch Boy paint company making them a fortune It costs  percent more
than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people
talk about because its remarkable They didnt just slap
a new ad on the product they changed what it meant
to build a paint product AmIhotornotcom  everyday
 people go to this site run by two volunteers and I can
tell you they are hard graders  They didnt get this way
by advertising a lot They got this way by being remarkable sometimes a little too remarkable And this picture frame
has a cord going out the back and you plug it into the wall My father has this on his desk and he sees his grandchildren
everyday changing constantly And every single person
who walks into his office hears the whole story
of how this thing ended up on his desk And one person at a time
the idea spreads These are not diamonds not really Theyre made from cremains After youre cremated you can
have yourself made into a gem Oh you like my ring Its my grandmother Fastestgrowing business
in the whole mortuary industry But you dont have to be Ozzie Osborne  you dont have to be
superoutrageous to do this What you have to do is figure out what people
really want and give it to them A couple of quick rules to wrap up The first one is Design
is free when you get to scale The people who come up
with stuff thats remarkable more often than not figure out
how to put design to work for them Number two The riskiest thing
you can do now is be safe Proctor and Gamble knows this right The whole model of being
Proctor and Gamble is always about average products
for average people Thats risky The safe thing to do now
is to be at the fringes be remarkable And being very good is one
of the worst things you can possibly do Very good is boring Very good is average It doesnt matter whether
youre making a record album or youre an architect
or you have a tract on sociology If its very good its not going to work
because no ones going to notice it So my three stories Silk put a product that does not need
to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk
in the refrigerated section Sales tripled Why Milk milk milk milk milk  not milk For the people who were there
and looking at that section it was remarkable They didnt triple their sales
with advertising they tripled it by doing
something remarkable That is a remarkable piece of art You dont have to like it but a foot tall dog made out of bushes
in the middle of New York City is remarkable Frank Gehry didnt just change a museum he changed an entire citys economy by designing one building that people
from all over the world went to see Now at countless meetings at you know the Portland City Council
or who knows where they said we need an architect 
can we get Frank Gehry Because he did something
that was at the fringes And my big failure
I came out with an entire  Music A record album and hopefully
a whole bunch of record albums in SACD this remarkable new format  and I marketed it straight to people
with dollar stereos People with dollar stereos
dont like new music So what you need to do
is figure out who does care Who is going to raise their hand and say I want to hear what youre doing next and sell something to them The last example I want to give you This is a map of Soap Lake Washington As you can see if thats nowhere
its in the middle of it But they do have a lake And people used to come from miles
around to swim in the lake They dont anymore So the founding fathers said
Weve got some money to spend What can we build here And like most committees they were going to build
something pretty safe And then an artist came to them 
this is a true artists rendering  he wants to build a foot tall
lava lamp in the center of town Thats a purple cow
thats something worth noticing I dont know about you but if they build it
thats where Im going to go Thank you very much for your attention ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

29,"Youll be happy to know that
Ill be talking not about my own tragedy but other peoples tragedy Its a lot easier to be lighthearted
about other peoples tragedy than your own and I want to keep it
in the spirit of the conference So if you believe the media accounts being a drug dealer in the height
of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life
in the words of Virginia Postrel There was money
there was drugs guns women you know you name it  jewelry
blingbling  it had it all What Im going to tell you today is that
in fact based on  years of research a unique opportunity
to go inside a gang  to see the actual books
the financial records of the gang  that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang
was a glamorous life But I think more realistically
that being in a gang  selling drugs for a gang  is perhaps
the worst job in all of America And thats what Id like
to convince you of today So there are three things I want to do First I want to explain
how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence
on innercity gangs Secondly I want to tell you how somebody like me
came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang 
an interesting story I think And then third I want to tell you
in a very superficial way about some of the things we found when we actually got to look
at the financial records the books of the gang So before I do that just one warning which is that this presentation
has been rated R by the Motion Picture
Association of America It contains adult themes adult language Given who is up on the stage
youll be delighted to know that in fact therell be no nudity  Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside So let me start by talking
about crack cocaine and how it transformed the gang To do that you have to actually go
back to a time before crack cocaine in the early s and look at it
from the perspective of a gang leader Being a gang leader in the inner city
wasnt such a bad deal in the mids  the early s let me say Now you had a lot of power
and you got to beat people up  you got a lot of prestige
a lot of respect But the thing is
there was no money in it The gang had no way to make money You couldnt charge dues
to the people in the gang because the people in the gang
didnt have any money You couldnt really make any money
selling marijuana  marijuanas too cheap it turns out You cant get rich selling marijuana You couldnt sell cocaine cocaines a great product 
powdered cocaine  but youve got to know rich white people And most of the innercity gang members
didnt know any rich white people so couldnt sell to that market You couldnt really do
petty crime either Turns out petty crimes
a terrible way to make a living As a result as a gang leader
you had you know power  its a pretty good life 
but the thing was in the end you were living at home with your mother And so it wasnt really a career There were limits to how powerful
and important you could be if you had to live at home
with your mother Then along comes crack cocaine And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell crack cocaine was the extrachunky
version of tomato sauce for the inner city Because crack cocaine
was an unbelievable innovation I dont have time to talk about it today
but if you think about it I would say that in the last  years of every invention or innovation
thats occurred in this country the biggest one in terms of impact on the wellbeing of people
who live in the inner city was crack cocaine And for the worse 
not for the better but for the worse It had a huge impact on life So what was it about crack cocaine It was a brilliant way
of getting the brain high Because you could smoke crack cocaine 
you cant smoke powdered cocaine  and smoking is a much more efficient
mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it And it turned out there was this audience
that didnt know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did And it was a perfect drug you could buy the cocaine
that went into it for a dollar sell it for five dollars Highly addictive 
the high was very short So for fifteen minutes
you get this great high and then when you come down all you want to do is get high again It created a wonderful market And for the people who were there
running the gang it was a great way seemingly
to make a lot of money At least for the people on the top So this is where we enter the picture Not really me  Im really
a bit player in all this My coauthor Sudhir Venkatesh
is the main character He was a math major in college
who had a good heart and decided he wanted
to get a sociology PhD came to the University of Chicago Now the three months
before he came to Chicago he had spent following the Grateful Dead And in his own words
he looked like a freak Hes a South Asian 
very darkskinned South Asian Big man and he had hair
in his words down to his ass Defied all kinds of boundaries Was he black or white
Was he man or woman He was really a curious sight to be seen So he showed up
at the University of Chicago and the famous sociologist
William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved
surveying people all across Chicago He took one look at Sudhir who was going
to go do some surveys for him and decided he knew exactly
the place to send him which was to one of the toughest
most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago
but in the entire United States So Sudhir the suburban boy who had never
really been in the inner city dutifully took his clipboard
and walked down to this housing project gets to the first building The first building
Well theres nobody there But he hears some voices
up in the stairwell so he climbs up the stairwell
comes around the corner and finds a group of young
AfricanAmerican men playing dice This is about 
peak of the crack epidemic This is a very dangerous job
being in a gang You dont like to be surprised You dont like to be surprised
by people who come around the corner And the mantra was
shoot first ask questions later Now Sudhir was lucky 
he was such a freak and that clipboard
probably saved his life because they figured no other
rival gang member would be coming up to shoot
at them with a clipboard So his greeting was not particularly
warm but they did say well OK  lets hear
your questions on your survey So  I kid you not  the first question on the survey
that he was sent to ask was How do you feel about being
poor and Black in America Makes you wonder about academics So the choice of answers were A Very Good B Good C Bad D Very Bad What Sudhir found out is in fact
that the real answer was the following A Very Good B Good C Bad
D Very Bad E Fuck you The survey was not in the end going
to be what got Sudhir off the hook He was held hostage
overnight in the stairwell There was a lot of gunfire there were a lot of philosophical
discussions he had with the gang members By morning the gang leader arrived checked out Sudhir
decided he was no threat and they let him go home So Sudhir went home
took a shower took a nap And you and I probably faced
with the situation would think I guess Im going to write
my dissertation on The Grateful Dead Ive been following them
for the last three months Sudhir on the other hand got right back walked
down to the housing project went up to the second floor and said Hey guys I had so much fun
hanging out with you last night I wonder if I could do it again tonight And that was the beginning of what turned
out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing
project on and off for  years hanging out in crack houses
going to jail with the gang members having the windows shot out of his car having the police break into his apartment
and steal his computer disks  you name it But ultimately the story
has a happy ending for Sudhir who became one of the most
respected sociologists in the country And especially for me as I sat in my office
with my Excel spreadsheet open waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver
to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang It was one of the most unequal
coauthoring relationships ever  But I was glad to be
the beneficiary of it So what did we find What did we find in the gang Well let me say one thing We really got access
to everybody in the gang We got an inside look at the gang
from the very bottom up to the very top They trusted Sudhir in ways
that really no academic has ever  or really anybody any outsider 
has ever earned the trust of these gangs to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting
for me  their books the financial records they kept They made them available to us
and we not only could study them but we could ask them questions
about what was in them So if I have to kind of summarize
very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what
I take away from the gang is its that if I had to draw
a parallel between the gang and any other organization it would be that the gang
is just like McDonalds in a lot of different respects 
the restaurant McDonalds So first in one way which isnt maybe the most interesting
way but its a good way to start  is in the way its organized
the hierarchy of the gang the way it looks So heres what the org chart
of the gang looks like I dont know if you know much
about org charts but if you were to assign a strippeddown
and simplified McDonalds org chart this is exactly what it would look like Its amazing but the top
level of the gang they actually call themselves
the Board of Directors And Sudhir says its not like these guys
had a very sophisticated view of what happened
in American corporate life but they had seen movies
like Wall Street and they had learned a little bit
about what it was like to be in the real world Now below that board of directors youve got essentially
what are regional VPs  people who control say the South Side
of Chicago or the West Side of Chicago Sudhir got to know very well the guy
who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant
financial endeavors they undertook But the thing that really makes the gang
seem like McDonalds is its franchisees The guys who are running
the local gangs  the foursquareblock
by foursquareblock areas  theyre just like the guys in some sense
who are running the McDonalds They are the entrepreneurs They get the exclusive property rights
to control the drugselling They get the name of the gang behind them
for merchandising and marketing And theyre the ones who basically
make the profit or lose a profit depending on how good
they are at running the business Now the group I really want you
to think about though are the ones at the bottom 
the foot soldiers These are the teenagers typically whod be standing out on the street
corner selling the drugs Extremely dangerous work And important to note is that almost all
of the weight all of the people in this organization are at the bottom 
just like McDonalds So in some sense the foot soldiers
are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonalds and its not just by chance
that theyre like them In fact in these neighborhoods
theyd be the same people So the same kids who are working
in the gang were actually at the very same time
typically working parttime at a place like McDonalds Which already foreshadows
the main result that Ive talked about about what a crappy job
it was being in the gang Because obviously if being in the gang
were such a wonderful lucrative job why in the world would these guys
moonlight at McDonalds So what do the wages look like
You might be surprised But based on being able to talk to them
and to see their records this is what it looks
like in terms of the wages The hourly wage the foot soldiers
were earning was  an hour It was below the minimum wage
And this is welldocumented Its easy to see by the patterns
of consumption they have It really is not fiction  its fact There was very little money in the gang
especially at the bottom Now if you managed to rise up say
and be that local leader the guy whos the equivalent
of the McDonalds franchisee youd be making  dollars a year And that in some ways
was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these
neighborhoods as a young black male If you managed to rise to the very top  or  dollars a year
is what youd hope to make Truly you would be a great success story And one of the sad parts
of this is that indeed among the many other
ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals
in these communities  this is what they were striving for They werent trying to make it
in legitimate ways because there were
no legitimate channels out This was the best way out And it actually was
the right choice probably to try to make it out this way You look at this the relationship to McDonalds
breaks down here The money looks about the same Why is it such a bad job Well the reason its such a bad job
is that theres somebody shooting at you a lot of the time So with shooting at you
what are the death rates We found in our gang  and admittedly this was not really
a standard situation this was a time of intense violence
of a lot of gang wars as this gang actually
became quite successful But there were costs And so the death rate  not to mention the rate of being arrested
sent to prison being wounded  the death rate in our sample
was seven percent per person per year Youre in the gang for four years you expect to die
with about a  percent likelihood That is about as high as you can get So for comparisons purposes lets think about some other walk of life
you may expect might be extremely risky Lets say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder
and youre sent to death row It turns out the death rates on death row
from all causes including execution two percent a year So its a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs
out on the street That gives you some pause
for those of you who believe that a death penaltys going to have
an enormous deterrent effect on crime To give you a sense of just how bad
the inner city was during crack  and Im not really focusing
on the negatives but really theres another story
to tell you there  if you look at the death rates
just of random young black males growing up in the inner city
in the United States the death rates during crack
were about one percent Thats extremely high And this is violent death 
its unbelievable in some sense To put it into perspective if you compare
this to the soldiers in Iraq for instance right now
fighting the war  percent So in some very literal way the young black men who were
growing up in this country were living in a war zone very much in the sense that the soldiers
over in Iraq are fighting in a war So why in the world you might ask would anybody be willing
to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for  an hour with a  percent chance of dying
over the next four years Why would they do that And I think there are a couple answers I think the first one
is that they got fooled by history It used to be the gang
was a rite of passage that the young people controlled the gang that as you got older
you dropped out of the gang So what happened was the people who happened to be
in the right place at the right time  the people who happened to be leading
the gang in the midtolates  became very very wealthy And so the logical thing to think was that they are going
to age out of the gang like everybody else has and the next generation is going
to take over and get the wealth There are striking similarities
I think to the Internet boom The first set of people in Silicon Valley
got very very rich And then all of my friends said
Maybe I should go do that too And they were willing to work very cheap
for stock options that never came In some sense
thats what happened exactly to the set of people we were looking at They were willing to start at the bottom just like say a firstyear
lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom work hour weeks
for not that much money because they think
theyre going to make partner But the rules changed
and they never got to make partner Indeed the same people who were running
all of the major gangs in the late s are still running the major gangs
in Chicago today They never passed on any of the wealth So everybody got stuck
at that anhour job and it turned out to be a disaster The other thing the gang was
very good at was marketing and trickery And so for instance
one thing the gang would do is  the gang leaders would have
big entourages and theyd drive fancy cars
and have fancy jewelry So what Sudhir eventually realized
as he hung out with them more is that really they didnt own
those cars  they just leased them because they couldnt afford
to own the fancy cars And they didnt really have gold jewelry
they had goldplated jewelry It goes back to you know
the realreal versus the fakereal And really they did all sorts
of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal
the gang was going to be So for instance they would give
a yearold kid a whole roll of bills to hold That yearold kid
would say to his friends Hey look at all the money
I got in the gang It wasnt his money  until he spent it and then he was in debt to the gang and was sort of an indentured
servant for a while So I have a couple minutes Let me do one last thing
I hadnt thought Id have time to do which is to talk about what we learned
more generally about economics from the study of the gang So economists tend to talk
in technical words Often our theories fail quite miserably
when we over the data but whats kind of interesting
is that in this setting it turned out that
some of the economic theories that worked not so well
in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy in some sense because
its unfettered capitalism Heres an economic principle This is one of the basic ideas
in labor economics called a compensating differential Its the idea that the increment to wages
that a worker requires to leave him indifferent
between performing two tasks one which is more unpleasant
than the other Compensating differential  its why
we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks The words of one of the members
of the gang I think make this clear So it turns out  Im sort
of getting ahead of myself  it turns out in the gang
when theres a war going on they actually pay the foot soldiers
twice as much money Its exactly this concept Because theyre not willing to be at risk And the words of a gang member
capture it quite nicely he says Would you stand around here when all
this shit   the shooting   if all this shits
going on No right So if I gonna be asked to put my life
on the line then front me the cash man I think the gang member says it
much more articulately than the economist about whats going on Heres another one Economists talk about game theory that every twoperson game
has a Nash equilibrium Heres the translation
you get from the gang member Theyre talking about the decision
of why they dont go shoot  One thing that turns out to be a great
business tactic in the gang if you go and just shoot guns in the air
in the other gangs territory  people are afraid to go buy drugs there theyre going to come
into your neighborhood Heres what he says
about why they dont do that If we start shooting around there
the other gangs territory nobody I mean you dig it
nobody gonna step on their turf But we gotta be careful cause they can shoot around here too
and then we all fucked So thats the same concept Then again sometimes
economists get it wrong One thing we observed in the data
is that it looked like  the gang leader always got paid No matter how bad it was economically
he always got himself paid We had some theories related to cash flow and lack of access to capital markets
and things like that Then we asked the gang member Why is it you always get paid
and your workers dont always get paid His response is You got all these niggers below you
who want your job you dig If you start taking losses
they see you as weak and shit And I thought about it and said CEOs often pay themselves
milliondollar bonuses even when companies
are losing a lot of money And it never would really occur
to an economist that this idea of weak and shit
could really be important Maybe weak and shit is an important
hypothesis that needs more analysis Thank you very much ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

30,Once upon a time there was a dread disease that afflicted children And in fact among all the diseases that existed in this land it was the worst It killed the most children And along came a brilliant inventor a scientist who came up with a partial cure for that disease And it wasnt perfect Many children still died but it was certainly better than what they had before And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free virtually free and was very easy to use But the worst thing about it was that you couldnt use it on the youngest children on infants and on oneyearolds And so as a consequence a few years later another scientist  perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him but building on the invention of the first one  came up with a second cure And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and oneyearolds And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive and it was very complicated to use And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end But what they did of course since it was so complicated and expensive they only used it on the zeroyearolds and the oneyearolds And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the twoyearolds and up And this went on for quite some time People were happy They had their two cures Until a particular mother whose child had just turned two died of this disease And she thought to herself My child just turned two and until the child turned two I had always used this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment And then the child turned two and I started using the cheap and easy treatment and I wonder  and she wondered like all parents who lose children wonder  if there isnt something that I could have done like keep on using that complicated expensive cure And she told all the other people and she said How could it possibly be that something thats cheap and simple works as well as something thats complicated and expensive And the people thought You know youre right It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution And the government they heard her story and the other people and they said Yeah youre right we should make a law We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children And the people were happy They were satisfied For many years this went along and everything was fine But then along came a lowly economist who had children himself and he used the expensive and complicated treatment But he knew about the cheap and simple one And he thought about it and the expensive one didnt seem that great to him So he thought I dont know anything about science but I do know something about data so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one And lo and behold when he went through the data he found that it didnt look like the expensive complicated solution was any better than the cheap one at least for the children who were two and older  the cheap one still didnt work on the kids who were younger And so he went forth to the people and he said Ive made this wonderful finding it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution and by doing so we could save ourselves  million dollars a year and we could spend that on our children in other ways And the parents were very unhappy and they said This is a terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing And the government was very upset And in particular the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought How can we hope to compete with something thats essentially free We would lose all of our market And people were very angry and they called him horrible names And he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days and seek out some more intelligent openminded people in a place called Oxford and come and try and tell the story at that place And so anyway here I am Its not a fairy tale Its a true story about the United States today and the disease Im referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children And the free cure is adult seatbelts and the expensive cure  the milliondollarayear cure  is child car seats And what Id like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true that for children two years old and up there really is no real benefit  proven benefit  of car seats in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts And then talk about why  what is it that makes that true And then finally talk a little bit about a third way about another technology which is probably better than anything we have but which  there hasnt been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution OK So many times when you try to do research on data it records complicated stories  its hard to find in the data It doesnt turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident thats happened since  So in every car crash in which at least one person dies they have information on all of the people So if you look at that data  its right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administrations website  you can just look at the raw data and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence thats in favor of car seats for children aged two and up So here is the data Here I have among two to sixyearolds  anyone above six basically no one uses car seats so you cant compare   percent of the children who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies themselves die If you put a child in a car seat  percent of the children die If theyre wearing a lapandshoulder belt in this raw data  percent die And interestingly wearing a laponly seatbelt  percent die And actually the theory tells you that the laponly seatbelts got to be worse than the lapandshoulder belt And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way So what we do in the study is  and this is just presenting the same information but turned into a figure to make it easier So the yellow bar represents car seats the orange bar lapandshoulder and the red bar laponly seatbelts And this is all relative to unrestrained  the bigger the bar the better Okay So this is the data I just showed OK So the highest bar is what youre striving to beat So you can control for the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting in etc the age of the child And thats that middle set of bars And so you can see that the laponly seatbelts start to look worse once you do that And then finally the last set of bars which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash    different characteristics of the crash And what you find is that the car seats and the lapandshoulder belts when it comes to saving lives fatalities look exactly identical And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well And its not just overall Its very robust to anything you want to look at One thing thats interesting if you look at frontalimpact crashes  when the car crashes the front hits into something  indeed what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better And I think this isnt just chance In order to have the car seat approved you need to pass certain federal standards all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash But when you look at other types of crashes like rearimpact crashes indeed the car seats dont perform as well And I think thats because theyve been optimized to pass as we always expect people to do to optimize relative to brightline rules about how affected the car will be And the other thing you might argue is Well car seats have got a lot better over time And so if we look at recent crashes  the whole data set is almost  years worth of data  you wont see it in the recent crashes The new car seats are far far better But indeed in recent crashes the lapandshoulder seatbelts actually are doing even better than the car seats They say Well thats impossible that cant be And the line of argument if you ask parents is But car seats are so expensive and complicated and they have this big tangle of latches how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated Its kind of an interesting logic I think that people use And the other logic they say Well the government wouldnt have told us to use them if they werent much better But whats interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two which has led to the passage of all these laws  not very much on data So you can only get so far I think in telling your story by using these abstract statistics And so I had some friends over to dinner and I was asking  we had a cookout  I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point They said Why dont you run some crash tests And I said Thats a great idea So we actually tried to commission some crash tests And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said some explicitly some not so explicitly All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers We cant risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats Now eventually one did Under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do this test for us  so anonymity and  dollars per seat that we crashed And so we went to Buffalo New York and here is the precursor to it These are the crash test dummies waiting for their chance to take the center stage And then heres how the crash test works Here they dont actually crash the entire car you know  its not worth ruining a whole car to do it So they just have these bench seats and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it So I just wanted you to look at this And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great Look at the kid in the car seat Does he not look content ready to go like he could survive anything And then if you look at the kid in back it looks like hes already choking before the crash even happens Its hard to believe when you look at this that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash So this is going to be a crash where theyre going to slam this thing forward into a wall at  miles an hour and see what happens OK So let me show you what happens These are threeyearold dummies by the way So here  this is the car seat Now watch two things watch how the head goes forward and basically hits the knees  and this is in the car seat  and watch how the car seat flies around in the rebound up in the air The car seats moving all over the place Bear in mind there are two things about this This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed  car seats who knew exactly how to do it And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them And so this is a test thats very much rigged in favor of the car seat OK So that kid in this crash fared very well The federal standards are that you have to score below a  to be an approved car seat on this crash in some metric of units which are not important And this crash would have been about a  So this car seat was actually an aboveaverage car seat from Consumer Reports and did quite well So the next one Now this is the kid same crash who is in the seatbelt He hardly moves at all actually relative to the other child The funny thing is the cam work is terrible because theyve only set it up to do the car seats and so they actually dont even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid thats on the rebound Anyway it turns out that those two crashes that actually the threeyearold did slightly worse So he gets about a  out of  you know on this range  relative to a  and something But still if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government and said I have invented a new car seat I would like you to approve it for selling then they would say This is a fantastic new car seat it works great It only got a  it could have gotten as high up as a  And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat So in some sense what this is suggesting is that its not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong which is putting children at risk Its just that fundamentally the car seats arent doing much So heres the crash So these are timed at the same time so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat  at rebound it takes a lot longer  but theres just a lot less movement for child whos in the seatbelt So Ill show you the sixyearold crashes as well The sixyearold is in a car seat and it turns out that looks terrible but thats great Thats like a  OK So that kid would do fine in the crash Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all And then heres the sixyearold in the seatbelt and in fact they get exactly within you know within one or two points of the same So really for the sixyearold the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever Thats some more evidence so in some sense  I was criticized by a scientist who said You could never publish a study with an n of  meaning those four crashes So I wrote him back and I said What about an n of  Because I had the other  other realworld crashes And I just think that its interesting that the idea of using realworld crashes which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do is something that scientists dont actually usually think  they would rather use a laboratory a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies than actually  years of data of what weve seen with children and with car seats And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that theres a much better solution out there thats gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working And if you think from a design perspective about going back to square one and say I just want to protect kids in the back seat I dont theres anyone in this room whod say Well the right way to start would be lets make a great seat belt for adults And then lets make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain I mean why not start  whos sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids But essentially do something like this which I dont know exactly how much it would cost to do but theres no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat Its just actually  you see this is folding up  its behind the seat Youve got a regular seat for adults and then you fold it down and the kid sits on top and its integrated It seems to me that this cant be a very expensive solution and its got to work better than what we already have So the question is is there any hope for adoption of something like this which would presumably save a lot of lives And I think the answer perhaps lies in a story The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful and why this may someday be adopted or not lies in a story that my dad told me relating to when he was a doctor in the US Air Force in England And this is a long time ago you were allowed to do things then you cant do today So my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them and hed say Come back in a week if you still feel lousy OK and most of them would not come back but some of them would come back And when they came back he still convinced they were not sick had another jar of pills In this jar were huge horse pills They were almost impossible to swallow And these to me are the analogy for the car seats People would look at these and say Man this thing is so big and so hard to swallow If this doesnt make me feel better you know what possibly could And it turned out that most people wouldnt come back because it worked But every once in a while there was still a patient convinced that he was sick and hed come back And my dad had a third jar of pills And the jar of pills he had he said were the tiniest little pills he could find so small you could barely see them And he would say listen I know I gave you that huge pill that complicated hardtoswallow pill before but now Ive got one thats so potent that is really tiny and small and almost invisible Its almost like this thing here which you cant even see And it turned out that never in all the times my dad gave out this pill the really tiny pill did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness So my dad always took that as evidence that this little teeny powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect And in some sense if thats the right story I think integrated car seats you will see very quickly becoming something that everyone has The other possible conclusion is well maybe after coming to my father three times getting sent home with placebos he still felt sick he went and found another doctor And thats completely possible And if thats the case then I think were stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come Thank you very much Audience I just wanted to ask you when we wear seatbelts we dont necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life its also to prevent lots of serious injury Your data looks at fatalities It doesnt look at serious injury Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury Because that would prove your case Steven Levitt Yeah thats a great question In my data and in another data set Ive looked at for New Jersey crashes I find very small differences in injury So in this data its statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lapandshoulder belts In the New Jersey data which is different because its not just fatal crashes but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported it turns out that there is a  percent difference in injuries but generally theyre the minor injuries Now whats interesting I should say this as a disclaimer there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data which suggests that car seats are dramatically better And they use a completely different methodology that involves  after the crash occurs they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash and they call them on the phone and they asked them what happened And I really cant resolve yet and Id like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences which are completely at odds with one another But its obviously a critical question The question is even if  are there enough serious injuries to make these costeffective Its kind of tricky Even if theyre right its not so clear that theyre so costeffective ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

31,I dont know your name Audience Member Howard Howard Thom Mayne Howard Im sitting next to Howard I dont know Howard obviously and hes going I hope youre not next Amazing Amazing performance I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that Let me start some place Im interested  I kind of do the same thing but I dont move my body Laughter And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space I work in the mineral world I work with more or less inert matter And I organize it And well its also a bit different because an architect versus lets say a dance company finally is a negotiation between ones private world ones conceptual world the world of ideas the world of aspirations of inventions with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations the naysayers Because I have to say for my whole career if theres anything thats been consistent its been that you cant do it No matter what Ive done what Ive tried to do everybody says it cant be done And its continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas And to be an architect somehow you have to negotiate between left and right and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world and then make it understood I can start any number of places because this process is also  I think  very different from some of the morning sessions which you had such a kind of very clear such a lineal idea like the last one say with Howard that I think the creative process in architecture the design process is extremely circuitous Its labyrinthine Its Calvinos idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line not the straight line And definitely my life has been part of that Im going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things But basically what we do is we try to give coherence to the world We make physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process they make cities And those things are the reflection of the processes and the time that they are made And what Im doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material Because really all Im interested in always as an architect is the way things are produced because thats what I do Right And its not based on an a priori notion I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying This is what it looks like In fact somebody mentioned  Ewan maybe it was you in your introduction  about this is what architects  did somebody say its what business people come to its what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line Huh Wow It doesnt work that way for me at all I have no interest in that whatsoever Architecture is the beginning of something because its  if youre not involved in first principles if youre not involved in the absolute the beginning of that generative process its cake decoration And Ive nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators if anybodys involved in cake decorations  its not what Im interested in doing Laughter And so in the formation of things in giving it form in concretizing these things it starts with some notion of how one organizes And Ive had for  years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear and to understand the nature of the final result of that representing the building itself Theres been a continual relationship between inventions which are private and reality which has been important to me A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen  years ago which was the modeling of a hippocampus  the territory of the brain that records shortterm memory  and the documentation of that the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer observing every kilometer a particular object of desire and then placing that within this And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies but built on nonsequiturs built on randomness And Id been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city an accretional notion of the city and that led to various ideas of organization And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems And its not any single system that makes the work Its the relationship  its the dynamics between the systems  which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is  that would otherwise not exist And those systems could be identified and they could be grouped together And of course today with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping etc we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because thats all we do Were producing spaces that accommodate human activity And what Im interested in is not the styling of that but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity And that directly connects to ideas of citymaking This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very very large city project that came directly out of this process which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it And the project  again enormous enormous competition  on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago which uses these processes And what youre looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces that deals with the enormity of the problem the complexity of the problem when were designing cities at larger and larger aggregates Because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems And that led us directly to the Olympic Village I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC We won the competition  what was it nine months ago Again a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated very largescale organisms And then also was working with broad strategies In this case we only used  of the  acres of land and the  acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs etc Its position of course in the middle of Manhattan  its on Hunters Point And then the broader ideas of citymaking start having direct influences on architecture on the elements that make up the broader scheme the buildings themselves and start guiding us Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place And so I can start this discussion in any number of places and Ive chosen three or four to talk about And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base Theres just no place that it doesnt somehow have a connective tissue to This is Jim Dine and its the absence of presence etc Its the clothing the skin without the presence of the character It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very kind of complex space And the idea was the relationship of the space which was made up of the fold of the image and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space which were in dialog And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations And this was the first prototype in Korea as were dealing with a dynamic envelope and then the same characteristic of the fabric It has a material identity and its translucent and its porous and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is And that turned right away into another project This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles And now were seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated Again its a very very simple notion If you look at most buildings what you look at is the building the facade and it is the building And all of a sudden were kind of moving away and were separating the skin from the body and thats going to lead to broader performance criteria which Im going to talk about in a minute And youre looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body And then again the building itself middle of Los Angeles right across from City Hall And as it moves it takes pieces of the earth with it It bends up Its part of a sign system which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles  the twodimension threedimension signing etc And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself Its transparent and it allows you to understand I think what is always the most interesting thing in any building which is the actual constructional processes that make it And its probably the most intense kind of territory of the work which is not occupied because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when its separated from function and this is an area that allows for that And then the skin starts transforming into other materials Were using light as a building material in this case Were working with Keith Sonnier in New York and were making this large outside room which is possible in Los Angeles and which is very much reflective of the urban the contemporary urban environments that you would find in Shibuya or youd find in Mexico City or Sao Paulo etc that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles And again all of it promoting transparency And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material Well that immediately turned into something much broader and as a scope And again were looking at an early sketch where Im understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction And now it turned into something much much broader as a problem and it has to do with performance This will be the first building in the United States that took  well I cant say it took the air conditioning out Its a hybrid I wanted a pure thing and I cant get it Its a wrong attitude actually because the hybrid is probably more interesting But we took the air conditioning out of the tower Theres some air conditioning left in the base but the skin now moves on hydraulics It forces air through a Venturi force if theres no wind It adjusts continually And we removed the air conditioning Huge huge thing Half a million dollars a year delta  of these  its just under a million square feet   and some thousand square feet   of these would power Sausalito  the delta on this And so now what were looking at as the projects get larger in scale as they interface with broader problems that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance Well I could also start here We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground Well our research  my generation for sure people who were going to school in the late s  made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture looking at architecture within its own territory and we were much more affected by film by what was going on in the art world etc This is of course Michael Heizer And when I saw this first an image and then visited it completely changed the way I thought after that point And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earths surface and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense And then  well he was probably looking at this  this is Nazca this is  years ago  the most amazing fourkilometer land sculptures Theyre just totally incredible And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw how we work This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona  well whatever it is a model a conceptual kind of idea And its the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable So it puts  square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work And there it is again as its starting to get resolved tectonically and then theres the school And of course were interested in participating with education I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X Y and Z function What Im interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because its a system thats developed not sculpturally Its an idea that started from my first discussion It has to do with a broad consistent logic and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building And theres an overt  at least theres an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem as one would understand that And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas It uses landscape as a major idea Then again were doing the headquarters for NOAA  National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency  outside of Washington in Maryland And this is how they see the world They have  satellites zipping around at plus or minus  miles and the sites in red And what we really want to do  well the architects if there are architects out there this is the Laugier Hut this is the primitive hut thats been around for so long  and what we wanted to do is really build this because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world and we wanted them to look down at their satellite how they see their own site that eightacre site and we wanted nothing left We wanted it to stay green Theres actually three baseball fields on it right now and theyre going to stay there We put one piece directly northsouth and it holds the dishes at the ears right And then right below that the processing and the mission lift and the mission control room and all the other spaces are underground And what you look at is an aircraft carrier thats performancedriven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion broken up by a series of courts and its five acres of uninterrupted horizontal space for their administrative offices And then that in turn propelled us to look at largerscale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue The new capital competition for Berlin four years ago And again we just finished the ECB  actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park which is parallel to the river and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric  the social cultural and the landscape recreational fabric of the city And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing but something thats only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time And a project that was realized in Austria the Hooper Bank which again used this idea of connecting typology the traditional buildings and morphology or the relationship of the development of land as an idea into a complex which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting this movement of the land thats a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it and other parts are much more energetic and intense And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together and then where part of it is in the ground part of it is oppositional lifts One enters the building as it lifts off the ground and it becomes part of the idea And then the skin  the edges of this  all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts geologic shifts Right And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior and those interiors again are promoting transparency for the workplace which has been a continual interest of ours And then again in a more kind of traditional setting this is a graduate student housing in Toronto and its very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city The main idea was the gateway where it breaks the site and the building occupies both the public space and the private space And its that territory of  its this thing I visited the site many times and everybody kind of  you can see this from two kilometers away its an exact center of the street and the whole notion is to engage the public to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city And finally one of the most interesting projects  its a courthouse And what I want to talk about  this is the Supreme Court of course  and well Im dealing with Michael Hogan the Chief Justice of Oregon You could not proceed without making this negotiation between ones own values and the relationship of the character youre working with and how he understands the court because Im showing him of course Corbusier at Savoy which is  which is the beginning of modern architecture Well then we get to this image And this is where the project started Because Im going Im interested in the phenomenon thats taking place in here And really what were talking about is constructing reality And Im a character thats extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because theres no such thing as nature any more Nature is gone Nature in the thcentury sense alright Nature is only a cultural edifice today right We construct it and we construct those ideas And then of course this one our governor at the moment And we spent some time with Conan believe it or not and then that led us to kind of the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic architectural And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work and the dynamics of that and what other sources of the work is And it led us to the project the courthouse which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse Youll find a stair thats the same length as the Supreme Court Heres a piano nobile which is a device used in the Renaissance The courts were made of that The skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution which were part of the little process all set on a plinth that defined it from the community Thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1

32,I was asked to come here and speak about creation And I only have  minutes and I see theyre counting already And I can  in  minutes I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation which I call creativity Creativity is how we cope with creation While creation sometimes seems a bit ungraspable or even pointless creativity is always meaningful See for instance in this picture You know creation is what put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters When you think about  you know creativity has a lot to do with causality too You know when I was a teenager I was a creator I just did things Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was and tried to maintain that persona  I became creative It wasnt until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition that I could track exactly  looks like all the craziest things that I had done all my drinking all my parties  they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually Im talking to you at this moment Though its actually true you know the reason Im talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil If I was born in Monterey probably would be in Brazil You know I was born in Brazil and grew up in the s under a climate of political distress and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way  in a sort of a semiotic black market You couldnt really say what you wanted to say you had to invent ways of doing it You didnt trust information very much That led me to another step of why Im here today is because I really liked media of all kinds I was a media junkie and eventually got involved with advertising My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards and based on speed angle of approach and actually blocks of text It was very  actually it was a very good study and got me a job in an ad agency And they also decided that I had to  to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it And another point  why Im here  is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life picked the thing  didnt have any friends On my way out I had to break a fight apart Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles They were in tuxedos and fighting It was very ugly And also  advertising people do that all the time  Laughter  and I  well what happened is when I went back it was on the way back to my car the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun  I dont know why he had a gun  and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor The first person was wearing a black tie a tuxedo It was me Luckily it wasnt fatal as you can all see And even more luckily the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money otherwise I press charges And thats how  with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in  and thats very  the basic reason Im talking to you here today because I got shot Laughter Applause Well when I started working with my own work I decided that I shouldnt do images You know I became  I took this very iconoclastic approach Because when I decided to go into advertising I wanted to do  I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice for whiskey commercials thats what I really wanted to do Laughter But I  they didnt let me do it so I just  you know they would only let me do other things But I wasnt into selling whiskey I was into selling ice The first works were actually objects It was kind of a mixture of found object product design and advertising And I called them relics They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in  This is the clown skull Is a remnant of a race of  a very evolved race of entertainers They lived in Brazil long time ago Laughter This is the Ashanti joystick Unfortunately it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform A Playstation II is in the works maybe for the next TED Ill bring it The rocking podium Laughter This is the preColumbian coffeemaker Laughter Actually the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks that I insisted that I wasnt having Colombian coffee the coffee was actually preColumbian The Bonsai table The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume for travel purposes And the half tombstone for people who are not dead yet I wanted to take that into the realm of images and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts So I decided to do work with clouds Because clouds can mean anything you want But now I wanted to work in a very lowtech way so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton a cloud and Durers praying hands  although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouses praying hands But I was still you know  this is a kitty cloud Theyre called Equivalents after Alfred Stieglitzs work The Snail But I was still working with sculpture and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter The Teapot I had a chance to go to Florence in  I think it was  and I saw Ghibertis Door of Paradise And he did something that was very tricky He put together two different media from different periods of time First he got an ageold way of making it which was relief and he worked this with threepoint perspective which was brandnew technology at the time And its totally overkill And your eye doesnt know which level to read And you become trapped into this kind of representation So I decided to make these very simple renderings that at first they are taken as a line drawing  you know something thats very  and then I did it with wire The idea was to  because everybody overlooks white  like pencil drawings you know And they would look at it  Ah its a pencil drawing Then you have this double take and see that its actually something that existed in time It had a physicality and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way towards the image So this is Monkey with Leica Relaxation Fiat Lux And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings And I wanted to deal with other subjects I started taking that into the realm of landscape which is something thats almost a picture of nothing I made these pictures called Pictures of Thread and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture These always end up being a photograph at the end or more like an etching in this case So this is a lighthouse This is  Yards after Corot  Yards after Gerhard Richter And I dont know how many yards after John Constable Departing from the lines I decided to tackle the idea of points like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts and I did work and play with them I got some photographs from them Upon my arrival in New York I decided  they were children of sugar plantation workers And by manipulating sugar over a black paper I made portraits of them These are  Applause  Thank you This is Valentina the Fastest It was just the name of the child with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly Valicia Jacynthe But another layer of representation was still introduced Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject  something that would interfere with the themes so chocolate is very good because it has  it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance And so I decided to make these pictures and they were very large so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them So theyre called Pictures of Chocolate Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I He was the first subject And Jackson Pollock also Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting because you know you go to that  you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily like a face goes into becoming just a texture Paparazzi I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection And I picked minimalist pieces because theyre about specificity And you render this with the most nonspecific material which is dust itself Like you know you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor They do a DNA scan of this they will come up with a great mailing list This is Richard Serra I bought a computer and they told me it had millions of colors in it You know an artists first response to this is who counted it You know And I realized that I never worked with color because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors But once theyre applied to numeric structure then you can feel more comfortable So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches They end up being very large pictures and I photographed with a very large camera  an x camera So you can see the surface of every single swatch  like in this picture of Chuck Close And you have to walk very far to be able to see it Also the reference to Gerhard Richters use of color charts  and the idea also entering another realm of representation thats very common to us today which is the bit map I ended up narrowing the subject to Monets Haystacks This is something I used to do as a joke  you know make  the same like  Robert Smithsons Spiral Jetty  and then leaving traces as if it was done on a tabletop I tried to prove that he didnt do that thing in the Salt Lake But then just doing the models I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself I opt for very simple line drawings  kind of stupid looking And at the same time I was doing these very large constructions being  meters away Now I would do very small ones which would be like  but under the same light and I would show them together so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking I wasnt interested in the very large things or in the small things I was more interested in the things in between you know because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there This is like you see  the size of a person over there This is a pipe A hanger And this is another thing that I did  you know working  everybody loves to watch somebody draw but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in  a lot of people at the same time to evidence a single drawing And I love this work because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months And it was quite wonderful because I had an interest  an early interest  in theater thats justified on this thing In theater you have the character and the actor in the same place trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience And in this youd have like a  something that looks like a cloud and it is a cloud at the same time So theyre like perfect actors My interest in acting especially bad acting goes a long way Actually I once paid like  dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of King Lear and I felt really robbed because by the time the actor started being King Lear he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see On the other hand you know I paid like three dollars I think  and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of Othello by an amateur group And it was quite fascinating because you know the guy  his name was Joey Grimaldi  he impersonated the Moorish general  you know for the first three minutes he was really that general and then he went back into plumber he worked as a plumber so  plumber general plumber general  so for three dollars I saw two tragedies for the price of one See I think its not really about impression making people fall for a really perfect illusion as much as it is to make  I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion Because its not about fooling somebody its actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief how much you want to be fooled Thats why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that Well I think thats it My time is nearly up Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

34,A fact came out of MIT couple of years ago Ken Hale whos a linguist said that of the  languages spoken on Earth right now  arent spoken by the children So that in one generation were going to halve our cultural diversity He went on to say that every two weeks an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture So an entire philosophy a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries goes away And this happens every two weeks So for the last  years since my dental experience I have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people What Id like to do right now is share some of those stories with you This is Tamdin She is a yearold nun She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country And when I met her she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa the capital of Tibet into Nepal across to India   days  to meet her leader the Dalai Lama The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala India So I took this picture three days after she arrived and she had this beatup pair of tennis shoes on with her toes sticking out And she crossed in March and theres a lot of snow at  feet in March This is Paldin Paldin is a yearold monk And he spent  years in prison His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet And he was beaten starved tortured  lost all his teeth while in prison And when I met him he was a kind gentle old man And it really impressed me  I met him two weeks after he got out of prison  that he went through that experience and ended up with the demeanor that he had So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people and Id spent about five weeks there and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala And it just so happened on the fifth week there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama And I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns many of which I had just interviewed and heard their stories and I watched their faces and they gave us a little FM radio and we could listen to the translation of his teachings And what he said was treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels because its your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment That hit me so hard telling these people that had been through this experience So two months later I went into Tibet and I started interviewing the people there taking my photographs Thats what I do I interview and do portraits And this is a little girl I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple And Id snuck in  because its totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet  its the quickest way you can get arrested So I snuck in a bunch of little walletsized pictures of the Dalai Lama and I would hand them out And when I gave them to the people theyd either hold them to their heart or theyd hold them up to their head and just stay there And this is  well at the time  I did this  years ago  that was  years after the Dalai Lama had left So I was going in interviewing these people and doing their portraits This is Jigme and her sister Sonam And they live up on the Chang Tang the Tibetan Plateau way in the western part of the country This is at  feet And they had just come down from the high pastures at  feet Same thing gave her a picture she held it up to her forehead And I usually hand out Polaroids when I do these because Im setting up lights and checking my lights and when I showed her her Polaroid she screamed and ran into her tent This is Tenzin Gyatso he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two out in a peasants house way out in the middle of nowhere At the age of four he was installed as the th Dalai Lama As a teenager he faced the invasion of his country and had to deal with it  he was the leader of the country Eight years later when they discovered there was a plot to kill him they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback and took the same trip that Tamdin did And hes never been back to his country since And if you think about this man  years later still sticking to this nonviolent response to a severe political and human rights issue And the young people young Tibetans are starting to say listen this doesnt work You know violence as a political tool is all the rage right now And he still is holding this line So this is our icon to nonviolence in our world  one of our living icons This is another leader of his people This is Moi This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon And Moi is  years old And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon  oil was discovered in  And in this period of time  since that time  as much oil or twice as much oil as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident was spilled in this little area of the Amazon and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe and theyre known as very fierce theyre known as auca And theyve managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns And we spent  I was with a team  two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt This was on a monkey hunt hunting with curaretipped darts And the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible They could hear things smell things see things I couldnt see And I couldnt even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts This is Yadira and Yadira is five years old Shes in a tribe thats neighboring the Huaorani And her tribe has had to move three times in the last  years because of the oil spills And we never hear about that And the latest infraction against these people is as part of Plan Colombia were spraying Paraquat or Round Up whatever it is  were defoliating thousands of acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon in our war on drugs And these people are the people who take the brunt of it This is Mengatoue Hes the shaman of the Huaorani and he said to us you know Im an older man now Im getting tired you know Im tired of spearing these oil workers I wish they would just go away And I was  I usually travel alone when I do my work but I did this  I hosted a program for Discovery and when I went down with the team I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people especially into the Huaorani deep into the Huaorani tribe And as it turned out these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals One of the things I did just before   August of   I took my son Dax who was  at the time and I took him to Pakistan Because at first I wanted  you know Ive taken him on a couple of trips but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less I wanted him to get an experience in the Islamic world and I also wanted him to  I was going there to work with a group do a story on a group called the Kalash that are a group of animists  animists that live  very small area  surrounded by Islam  theres  of these Kalash left theyre incredible people So it was a great experience for him He stayed up all night with them drumming and dancing And he brought a soccer ball and we had soccer every night in this little village And then we went up and met their shaman By the way Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well And this is John Doolikahn whos the shaman of the Kalash And hes up in the mountains right on the border with Afghanistan In fact on that other side is the area Tora Bora the area where Osama bin Ladens supposed to be This is the tribal area And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn And the shaman  I did a whole series on shamanism which is an interesting phenomenon But around the world they go into trance in different ways and in Pakistan the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke And theyre all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance You know getting kids used to different realities I think is so important What Dan Dennett said the other day  having a curriculum where they study different religions just to make a mental flexibility give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems  I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place And all the security issues they cause us So one thing we did five years ago we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle We now have  sites We have one in Kathmandu Nepal Dharamsala India Takaungu Kenya  Takaungu is onethird Christian onethird Muslim and onethird animist the community is  Ollantaytambo Peru and Arctic Village Alaska This is Daniel hes one of our students in Arctic Village Alaska He lives in this log cabin  no running water no heat other than  no windows and highspeed Internet connection And this is  I see this rolling out all over  this is our site in Ollantaytambo Peru four years ago where they first saw their first computers now they have computers in their classrooms And the way weve done this  we teach digital storytelling to these kids And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about And this is in Peru where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up And the way we do it is we do it in workshops and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling and have them work with the kids And just this last year weve taken a group of teenagers in and this has worked the best So our dream is to bring teenagers together so theyll have a community service experience as well as a crosscultural experience as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan childrens village in Dharamsala We have the website where the kids all get their homepage This is all their movies Weve got about  movies that these kids have made and theyre quite incredible The one I want to show you  after we get them to make the movies we have a night where we show the movies to the community And this is in Takaungu  weve got a generator and a digital projector and were projecting it up against a barn and showing one of the movies that they made And if you get a chance you can go to our website and youll see the incredible work these kids do The other thing I wanted to give indigenous people a voice That was one of the big motivating factors But the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country National Geographic just did a Roper Study of  to  year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries It was a two million dollar study United States came in second to last in geographic knowledge  percent of the kids couldnt find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map  percent couldnt find India  percent couldnt find the Pacific Ocean And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago So what Id like to show you now in the couple of minutes I have left is a film that a student made in Guatemala We just had a workshop in Guatemala A week before we got to the workshop a massive landslide caused by Hurricane Stan last October came in and buried  people alive in their village And this kid lived in the village  he wasnt there at the time  and this is the little movie he put together about that And he hadnt seen a computer before we did this movie We taught him Photoshop and  yeah we can play it This is an old Mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

35,Well I thought there would be a podium so Im a bit scared Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA And since you know I follow his orders Ill do it But it slightly bores me And you know I wrote a book So Ill say something   Ill say a little about you know how the discovery was made and why Francis and I found it And then I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now In back of me is a picture of me when I was  I was at the University of Chicago in my third year and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school So you  it was fun to get away from high school  Laughter  because I was very small and I was no good in sports or anything like that But I should say that my background  my father was you know raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican but after one year of college he became an atheist and a Democrat And my mother was Irish Catholic and  but she didnt take religion too seriously And by the age of  I was no longer going to Sunday Mass and going on birdwatching walks with my father So early on I heard of Charles Darwin I guess you know he was the big hero And you know you understand life as it now exists through evolution And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major and thought I would end up you know if I was bright enough maybe getting a PhD from Cornell in ornithology Then in the Chicago paper there was a review of a book called What is Life by the great physicist Schrodinger And that of course had been a question I wanted to know You know Darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes and it had to be present on a molecule Id never really thought of molecules before You know chromosomes but this was a molecule and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form And there was the big question of how did you copy the information So that was the book And so from that moment on I wanted to be a geneticist  understand the gene and through that understand life So I had you know a hero at a distance It wasnt a baseball player it was Linus Pauling And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down So I went to Indiana which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics and besides they had a really good basketball team Laughter So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana And it was at Indiana I got the impression that you know the gene was likely to be DNA And so when I got my PhD I should go and search for DNA So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought well maybe I could become a biochemist but I discovered biochemistry was very boring It wasnt going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science And oh thats the book little book You can read it in about two hours And  but then I went to a meeting in Italy And there was an unexpected speaker who wasnt on the program and he talked about DNA And this was Maurice Wilkins He was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked DNA because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes Most people believed it was proteins But Wilkins you know thought DNA was the best bet and he showed this xray photograph Sort of crystalline So DNA had a structure even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions So there was something universal about the DNA molecule So I wanted to work with him but he didnt want a former birdwatcher and I ended up in Cambridge England So I went to Cambridge because it was really the best place in the world then for xray crystallography And xray crystallography is now a subject in you know chemistry departments I mean in those days it was the domain of the physicists So the best place for xray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge And there I met Francis Crick I went there without knowing him He was  I was  And within a day we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA Not solve it like you know in rigorous fashion but build a model an electromodel using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff from xray photographs But just ask what the molecule  how should it fold up And the reason for doing so at the center of this photograph is Linus Pauling About six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins And in doing so he banished the man out on the right Sir Lawrence Bragg who was the Cavendish professor This is a photograph several years later when Bragg had cause to smile He certainly wasnt smiling when I got there because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix and the Cambridge people failing because they werent chemists And certainly neither Crick or I were chemists so we tried to build a model And he knew Francis knew Wilkins So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix Xray diagram he thought was comparable with the helix So we built a threestranded model The people from London came up Wilkins and this collaborator or possible collaborator Rosalind Franklin came up and sort of laughed at our model They said it was lousy and it was So we were told to build no more models we were incompetent And so we didnt build any models and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins And basically I did nothing And  except read You know basically reading is a good thing you get facts And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Paulings going to move on to DNA If DNA is that important Linus will know it Hell build a model and then were going to be scooped And in fact hed written the people in London Could he see their xray photograph And they had the wisdom to say no So he didnt have it But there was ones in the literature Actually Linus didnt look at them that carefully But about oh  months after I got to Cambridge a rumor began to appear from Linus Paulings son who was in Cambridge that his father was now working on DNA And so one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling and he gave me a copy of his fathers manuscripts And boy I was scared because I thought you know we may be scooped I have nothing to do no qualifications for anything And so there was the paper and he proposed a threestranded structure And I read it and it was just  it was crap So this was you know unexpected from the worlds   and so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups Well if the peak pH that cells have is around seven those hydrogen bonds couldnt exist We rushed over to the chemistry department and said Could Pauling be right And Alex Hust said No So we were happy And you know we were still in the game but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong And so Bragg said Build models And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript  I should say I took the manuscript to London and showed the people Well I said Linus was wrong and that were still in the game and that they should immediately start building models But Wilkins said no Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left he would start building models And so I came back with that news to Cambridge and Bragg said Build models Well of course I wanted to build models And theres a picture of Rosalind She really you know in one sense she was a chemist but really she would have been trained  she didnt know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry She was a crystallographer And I think part of the reason she didnt want to build models was she wasnt a chemist whereas Pauling was a chemist And so Crick and I you know started building models and Id learned a little chemistry but not enough Well we got the answer on the th February  And it was because of a rule which to me is a very good rule Never be the brightest person in a room and we werent We werent the best chemists in the room I went in and showed them a pairing Id done and Jerry Donohue  he was a chemist  he said its wrong Youve got  the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place I just put them down like they were in the books He said they were wrong So the next day you know after I thought Well he might be right So I changed the locations and then we found the base pairing and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions And we knew we were right So it was a pretty you know it all happened in about two hours From nothing to thing And we knew it was big because you know if you just put A next to T and G next to C you have a copying mechanism So we saw how genetic information is carried Its the order of the four bases So in a sense it is a sort of digitaltype information And you copy it by going from strandseparating So you know if it didnt work this way you might as well believe it because you didnt have any other scheme But thats not the way most scientists think Most scientists are really rather dull They said we wont think about it until we know its right But you know we thought well its at least  percent right or  percent right So think about it The next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in Nature  none And so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last part of the trio how do you  what does this genetic information do It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule and then how do you go from RNA to protein For about three years we just  I tried to solve the structure of RNA It didnt yield It didnt give good xray photographs I was decidedly unhappy a girl didnt marry me It was really you know sort of a shitty time So theres a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl so Im still looking happy But there is what we did when we didnt know where to go forward we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club George Gamow also a great physicist he designed the tie He was one of the members The question was How do you go from a fourletter code to the letter code of proteins Feynman was a member and Teller and friends of Gamow But thats the only  no we were only photographed twice And on both occasions you know one of us was missing the tie Theres Francis up on the upper right and Alex Rich  the MDturnedcrystallographer  is next to me This was taken in Cambridge in September of  And Im smiling sort of forced I think because the girl I had boy she was gone And so I didnt really get happy until  because then we found out basically you know that there are three forms of RNA And we knew basically DNA provides the information for RNA RNA provides the information for protein And that let Marshall Nirenberg you know take RNA  synthetic RNA  put it in a system making protein He made polyphenylalanine polyphenylalanine So thats the first cracking of the genetic code and it was all over by  So there thats what Chris wanted me to do it was  so what happened since then Well at that time  I should go back When we found the structure of DNA I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor The physicist Leo Szilard he looked at me and said Are you going to patent this And  but he knew patent law and that we couldnt patent it because you couldnt No use for it And so DNA didnt become a useful molecule and the lawyers didnt enter into the equation until   years later when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money At least they patented something which you know could do useful things And then they learned how to read the letters for the code And boom weve you know had a biotech industry And but we were still a long ways from you know answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood which is How do you naturenurture And so Ill go on Im already out of time but this is Michael Wigler a very very clever mathematician turned physicist And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and eventually a million spots along it Theres a chip there a conventional one Then theres one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen which is way ahead of Affymetrix And we use their technique And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions So the DNA is really badly mucked up whereas if you have a chance of surviving the DNA isnt so mucked up So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call DNA biopsies Before you get treated for cancer you should really look at this technique and get a feeling of the face of the enemy Its not a  its only a partial look but its a  I think its going to be very very useful So we started with breast cancer because theres lots of money for it no government money And now I have a sort of vested interest I want to do it for prostate cancer So you know you arent treated if its not dangerous But Wigler besides looking at cancer cells looked at normal cells and made a really sort of surprising observation Which is all of us have about  places in our genome where weve lost a gene or gained another one So were sort of all imperfect And the question is well if were around here you know these little losses or gains might not be too bad But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene maybe well feel sick So the first disease he looked at is autism And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it Looking at an individual is about  dollars And the parent of a child with Aspergers disease the highintelligence autism had sent his thing to a conventional company they didnt do it Couldnt do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism And you can see here there are a lot of them So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA I mean big piece at the molecular level We saw one autistic kid about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes We havent yet looked at the parents but the parents probably dont have that loss or they wouldnt be parents Now so our autism study is just beginning We got three million dollars I think it will cost at least  to  before youd be in a position to help parents whove had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we spot the difference So this same technique should probably look at all Its a wonderful way to find genes And so Ill conclude by saying weve looked at  people with schizophrenia And we thought wed probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture But as you can see theres seven out of  had a change which was very high And yet in the controls there were three So whats the meaning of the controls Were they crazy also and we didnt know it Or you know were they normal I would guess theyre normal And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure and whether this is one that predisposes  and then theres only a subsegment of the population thats capable of being schizophrenic Now we dont have really any evidence of it but I think to give you a hypothesis the best guess is that if youre lefthanded youre prone to schizophrenia  percent of schizophrenic people are lefthanded and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means  percent of the people are genetically lefthanded but only half of it showed I dont have the time to say Now some people who think theyre righthanded are genetically lefthanded OK Im just saying that if you think oh I dont carry a lefthanded gene so therefore my you know children wont be at risk of schizophrenia You might OK So its to me an extraordinarily exciting time We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar theres a relationship And if I had enough money wed find them all this year I thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

36,Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow So thats Kibera the largest squatter community in Nairobi This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay India whats called Mumbai these days This is Hosinia the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro And this is Sultanbelyi which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow the new urban world Now why do I say that To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here his name is Julius And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera So I had been there almost three months and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around he grabbed my hand for support which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing Theyre very polite and they dont get so forward so quickly And I found out later that it was Julius first day in Nairobi and hes one of many So close to  people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas Thats and Im going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning not almost  million people a week but almost  million people a week but Im a journalist and we exaggerate so almost  million people a week close to  million people a year And if you do the math thats  people every minute So thatll be  in the  minutes that Im given to talk here between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities And here are the statistics Today  a billion squatters one in six people on the planet   two billion squatters one in four people on the planet And the estimate is that in  therell be three billion squatters better than one in three people on earth So these are the cities of the future and we have to engage them And I was thinking this morning of the good life and before I show you the rest of my presentation Im going to violate TED rules here and Im going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is So  The hut was made of corrugated metal set on a concrete pad It was a  by  cell Armstrong OBrian Jr shared it with three other men Armstrong and his friends had no water  they bought it from a nearby tap owner  no toilet  the families in this compound shared a single pitlatrine  and no sewers or sanitation They did have electricity but it was illegal service tapped from someone elses wires and could only power one feeble bulb This was Southland a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi Kenya But it couldve been anywhere in the city because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this  million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services no toilets no rights Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation they paid  shillings in rent about  bucks a month a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown and they could not afford to be late with the money In case you owe one month the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out He will confiscate your things Armstrong said Not one month one day his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu who was cooking ugali the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country cut into the conversation They called their landlord a Wabenzi meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a MercedesBenz Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof and we perspired as we ate After we finished Armstrong straightened his tie put on a wool sports jacket and we headed out into the glare Outside a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata It was perhaps eight feet tall  feet long and  feet wide And it was set in a wider watery ooze As we passed two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash They couldnt have been more than five or six years old They were barefoot and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile I thought they might be playing King of the Hill but I was wrong Once atop the pile one of the boys lowered his shorts squatted and defecated The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs When  families   people or so  share a single latrine a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing But it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating  that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood For Armstrong Southland wasnt constrained by its material conditions Instead the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could freedom This place is very addictive he had said Its a simple life but nobody is restricting you Nobody is controlling what you do Once you have stayed here you cannot go back He meant back beyond that mountain of trash back in the legal city of legal buildings with legal leases and legal rights Once you have stayed here he said you can stay for the rest of your life So he has hope and this is where these communities start This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera little more than a stickandmud hut next to a garbage heap This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay India This is home improvement putting plastic tarps on your roof This is in Rio de Janeiro and its getting a bit better right Were seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs and plaster over the brick some color and this is Sulay Montakayas house in Sultanbelyi and its getting even better Hes got a fence he scavenged a door hes got new tile on the roof And then you get Rocinha and you can see that its getting even better The buildings here are multistory They develop  you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other room after room after room And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories and they sell their loggia or roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building and then that person sells the roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick And then you get Sultanbelyi in Turkey where its even built to a higher level of design The crud in the front is mattress stuffing and you see that all over Turkey People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs But the green building on behind you can see that the top floor is not occupied so people are building with the possibility of expansion And its built to a pretty high standard of design And then you finally get squatter homes like this which is built on the suburban model Hey thats a single family home in the squatter community Thats also in Istanbul Turkey Theyre quite vital places these communities This is the main drag of Rocinha the Estrada da Gavea and theres a bus route that runs through it lots of people out on the street These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities They have more things going on in them This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a beco  these are how you get around the community Its on very steep ground Theyre built on the hills inland from the beaches in Rio and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions So thats just a rock in the hillside And these becos are normally very crowded and people hump furniture up them or refrigerators up them all sorts of things Beer is all carried in on your shoulders Beer is a very important thing in Brazil This is commerce in Kenya right along the train tracks so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way This is a marketplace also in Kenya Toi Market lots of dealers in almost everything you want to buy Those green things in the foreground are mangoes This is a shopping street in Kibera and you can see that theres a soda dealer a health clinic two beauty salons a bar two grocery stores and a church and more Its a typical downtown street it just happens to be selfbuilt This here on the righthand side is whats called a  if you look at the fine print under the awning  its a hotel And what hotel means in Kenya and India is an eatingplace So thats a restaurant People steal electrical power  this is Rio People tap in and they have thieves who are called grillos or crickets and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood People burn trash to get rid of the garbage and they dig their own sewer channels Talk about more plastic bags than plankton And sometimes they have natural trashdisposal And when they have more money they cement their streets and they put in sewers and good water pipes and stuff like that This is water going to Rio People run their water pipes all over the place and that little hut right there has a pump in it and thats what people do they steal electricity they install a pump and they tap into the water main and pump water up to their houses So the question is how do you go from the mudhut village to the more developed city to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi I say there are two things One is people need a guarantee they wont be evicted That does not necessarily mean property rights and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question because property rights create a lot of complications Theyre most often sold to people and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt Theres a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes dont work in these cases but they do need security of tenure And they need access to politics and that can mean two things That can mean community organizing from below but it can also mean possibilities from above And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters One is that  its called gecekondu in Turkish which means built overnight and if you build your house overnight in Turkey you cant be evicted without due process of law if they dont catch you during the night And the second aspect is that once you have  people in the community you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal submunicipality And when youre a legal submunicipality you suddenly have politics Youre allowed to have an elected government collect taxes provide municipal services and thats exactly what they do So these are the civic leaders of the future The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai Thats Sureka Gundi she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median Theyre very outspoken Theyre very active They can be community leaders This woman is Nine which means grandma in Turkish And there were three old ladies who lived in  thats her selfbuilt house behind her  and theyve lived there for  or  years and they are the backbone of the community there This is Richard Muthama Peter and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood and is a great resource in the community And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio the fruit merchant with his two kids here and a more honest and giving and caring man I dont know The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people So I think the message I take from what I read from the book from what Armstrong said and from all these people is that these are neighborhoods The issue is not urban poverty The issue is not the larger overarching thing The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods  this is a legitimate form of urban development  and that cities have to engage these residents because they are building the cities of the future Thank you very much

37,"Charles Van Doren who was later
a senior editor of Britannica said the ideal encyclopedia
should be radical  it should stop being safe But if you know anything about the history
of Britannica since  it was anything but radical still a very completely safe
stodgy type of encyclopedia Wikipedia on the other hand
begins with a very radical idea and thats for all of us
to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access
to the sum of all human knowledge And thats what were doing So Wikipedia  you just saw the little
demonstration of it  its a freely licensed encyclopedia Its written by thousands of volunteers all over the world
in many many languages Its written using wiki software  which is the type of software
he just demonstrated  so anyone can quickly edit and save and it goes live
on the Internet immediately And everything about Wikipedia is managed
by virtually an allvolunteer staff So when Yochai is talking
about new methods of organization hes exactly describing Wikipedia And what Im going to do today is tell you a little bit more
about how it really works on the inside So Wikipedias owned
by the Wikimedia Foundation which I founded a nonprofit organization And our goal the core aim
of the Wikimedia Foundation is to get a free encyclopedia
to every single person on the planet And so if you think
about what that means it means a lot more
than just building a cool website Were really interested
in all the issues of the digital divide poverty worldwide empowering people everywhere
to have the information that they need to make good decisions And so were going
to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet And so thats a big part of why
weve chosen the free licensing model because that empowers local
entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to  they can take our content
and do anything they like with it  you can copy it redistribute it  and you can do it
commercially or noncommercially So theres a lot of opportunities
that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world Were funded by donations from the public and one of the more
interesting things about that is how little money
it actually takes to run Wikipedia So Yochai showed you the graph
of what the cost of a printing press was And Im going to tell you
what the cost of Wikipedia is But first Ill show you how big it is So weve got over 
articles in English Weve got two million total articles
across many many different languages The biggest languages
are German Japanese French  all the WesternEuropean
languages are quite big But only around onethird
of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia which is surprising to a lot of people A lot of people think in a very
Englishcentric way on the Internet but for us were truly global Were in many many languages How popular weve gotten to be 
were a top website and were more popular
than the New York Times So this is where we get
to Yochais discussion This shows the growth of Wikipedia 
were the blue line there  and this is the New York Times over there And whats interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge
enormous corporate operation with I have no idea
how many hundreds of employees We have exactly one employee and that employee
is our lead software developer And hes only been our employee
since January  all the other growth before that  So the servers are managed
by a ragtag band of volunteers All the editing is done by volunteers And the way that were organized is not like any traditional
organization you can imagine People are always asking
Well whos in charge of this or Who does that And the answer is
anybody who wants to pitch in Its a very unusual and chaotic thing Weve got over  servers now
in three locations These are managed by volunteer
system administrators who are online I can go online
any time of the day or night and see eight to  people waiting for me to ask a question or something
anything about the servers You could never afford
to do this in a company You could never afford to have a standby crew of people
 hours a day and do what were doing at Wikipedia So were doing around
 billion page views monthly so its really gotten to be a huge thing And everything is managed
by the volunteers And the total monthly cost
for our bandwidth is about  dollars And thats essentially our main cost We could actually do without the employee We hired Brian because he was
working parttime for two years and fulltime at Wikipedia so we actually hired him so he could get a life
and go to the movies sometimes So the big question when youve got
this really chaotic organization is why isnt it all rubbish Why is the website as good as it is First of all how good is it Well its pretty good It isnt perfect but its much better
than you would expect given our completely chaotic model So when you saw him make
a ridiculous edit to the page about me you think Oh this is obviously
just going to degenerate into rubbish But when weve seen quality tests  and there havent been enough of these yet and Im really encouraging
people to do more comparing Wikipedia
to traditional things  we win hands down So a German magazine
compared German Wikipedia which is much much smaller than English to Microsoft Encarta
and to Brockhaus multimedial and we won across the board They hired experts to come and look
at articles and compare the quality and we were very pleased with that result So a lot of people have heard about
the Wikipedia BushKerry controversy The media has covered this
somewhat extensively It started out
with an article in Red Herring The reporters called me up and they  I mean I have to say
they spelled my name right but they really wanted to say
the BushKerry election is so contentious its tearing apart
the Wikipedia community And so they quote me as saying Theyre the most contentious
in the history of Wikipedia What I actually said
is theyre not contentious at all So its a slight misquote The articles were edited quite heavily And it is true that we did
have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions Time magazine recently reported that Extreme action sometimes has to be taken and Wales locked the entries
on Kerry and Bush for most of  This came after I told the reporter
that we had to lock it for  occasionally a little bit here and there So the truth in general
is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think
we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all Articles on controversial topics
are edited a lot but they dont cause much controversy
within the community And the reason for this is that most
people understand the need for neutrality The real struggle is not
between the right and the left  thats where most people assume  but its between
the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly
on either of those qualities The actual truth
about the specific BushKerry incident is that the BushKerry articles were locked less than one percent
of the time in  and it wasnt because
they were contentious it was just because
there was routine vandalism  which happens sometimes even on stage  Sometimes even reporters have reported
to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed
that it was fixed so quickly And I said  you know I always say
please dont do that Thats not a good thing So how do we do this How do we manage the quality control How does it work So theres a few elements mostly social policies
and some elements of the software So the biggest
and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy This is something
that I set down from the very beginning as a core principle of the community
thats completely not debatable Its a social concept of cooperation so we dont talk a lot
about truth and objectivity The reason for this is if we say were only going to write
the truth about some topic that doesnt do us a damn bit of good
of figuring out what to write because I dont agree with you
about whats the truth But we have this
jargon term of neutrality which has its own long history
within the community which basically says
any time theres a controversial issue Wikipedia itself should not
take a stand on the issue We should merely report on what
reputable parties have said about it So this neutrality policy
is really important for us because it empowers a community
that is very diverse to come together
and actually get some work done So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political
religious cultural backgrounds By having this firm neutrality policy which is nonnegotiable
from the beginning we ensure that people can work together and that the entries
dont become simply a war back and forth
between the left and the right If you engage in that type of behavior
youll be asked to leave the community So realtime peer review Every single change on the site
goes to the Recent changes page So as soon as he made his change
it went to the Recent changes page That recent changes page
was also fed into an IRC channel which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring
with various software tools And people can get RSS feeds  they can get email
notifications of changes And then users can set up
their own personal watch list So my page is on quite a few
volunteers watch lists because it is sometimes vandalized And therefore what happens is someone
will notice the change very quickly and then theyll just
simply revert the change Theres a new pages feed for example so you can go
to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as its created This is really important because a lot of new pages
are just garbage that has to be deleted you know ASDFASDF But also thats some
of the most interesting and fun things some of the new articles People will start an article
on some interesting topic other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help
and make it much better So we do have edits by anonymous users which is one of the most controversial
and intriguing things about Wikipedia So Chris was able to do his change 
he didnt have to log in or anything he just went on the website
and made a change But it turns out
that only about  percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users And thats a really important
thing to understand the vast majority of the edits
that go on on the website are from a very closeknit community
of maybe  to  people who are in constant communication And we have over  IRC channels
 mailing lists All these people know each other They communicate
We have offline meetings These are the people
who are doing the bulk of the site and they are in a sense
semiprofessionals at what theyre doing The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher
than professional standards of quality We dont always meet those standards
but thats what were striving for And so that tight community
is who really cares for the site and these are some
of the smartest people Ive ever met Its my job to say that
but its actually true The type of people who were drawn
to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people The tools and the software
theres lots of tools that allow us  allow us meaning the community  to selfmonitor
and to monitor all the work This is an example
of a page history on flat Earth and you can see some changes
that were made Whats nice about this page
is you can immediately take a look at this and see OK I understand now When somebody goes and looks at  they see that someone
an anonymous IP number made an edit to my page That sounds suspicious
Who is this person Somebody looks at it  they can immediately see
highlighted in red all of the changes that took place  to see OK well these words
have changed things like this So thats one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor
the history of a page Another thing that we do
within the community is we leave everything very openended Most of the social rules
and the methods of work are left completely openended
in the software All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages And so theres nothing
in the software that enforces the rules The example Ive got up here
is the Votes for Deletion page So I mentioned earlier
people type ASDFASDF  it needs to be deleted Cases like that
the administrators just delete it Theres no reason
to have a big argument about it But you can imagine theres a lot
of other areas where the question is is this notable enough
to go in an encyclopedia Is the information verifiable
Is it a hoax Is it true Is it what So we needed a social method
for figuring out the answer to this And so the method that arose
organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page And in the particular
example we have here its a film Twisted Issues and the first person says Now this is supposedly a film
It fails the Google test miserably The Google test is you look in Google
and see if its there because if somethings not even in Google
it probably doesnt exist at all Its not a perfect rule but its a nice starting point
for quick research So somebody says Delete it please
Delete it  its not notable And then somebody says
Wait I found it I found it in a book Film Threat Video Guide
the  Underground Films You Must See So the next persons says Clean it up Somebody says Ive found it on IMDB
Keep keep keep And whats interesting about this
is that the software is  these votes are just text
typed into a page This is not really a vote
so much as it is a dialogue Now it is true that at the end of the day an administrator can go through here
and take a look at this and say OK  deletes two keeps
well delete it But in other cases
this could be  deletes and two keeps and we would keep it
because if those last two keeps say Wait a minute Nobody else saw this
but I found it in a book and I found a link
to a page that describes it and Im going to clean it up tomorrow
so please dont delete it then it would survive And it also matters
who the people are who are voting Like I say its a tightknit community Down here at the bottom
Keep real movie RickK RickK is a very famous Wikipedian
who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism hoaxes
and votes for deletion His voice carries a lot of weight
within the community because he knows what hes doing So how is all this governed People really want to know
about administrators things like that So the Wikipedia governance model
the governance of the community is a very confusing
but workable mix of consensus  meaning we try not to vote
on the content of articles because the majority view
is not necessarily neutral  some amount of democracy  all of the administrators  these are the people
who have the ability to delete pages That doesnt mean that they have
the right to delete pages They still have to follow all the rules 
but theyre elected by the community Sometimes people 
random trolls on the Internet  like to accuse me
of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia I always laugh at this because I have
no idea how theyre elected actually Theres a certain amount of aristocracy You got a hint of that
when I mentioned like RickKs voice would carry
a lot more weight than someone we dont know I give this talk sometimes with Angela who was just reelected to the board
from the community  to the Board of the Foundation with more than twice the votes
of the person who didnt make it And I always embarrass her because I say Well Angela for example could get away with doing
absolutely anything within Wikipedia because shes so admired and so powerful But the irony is of course that Angela
can do this because shes the one person who you know would never ever
break any rules of Wikipedia And I also like to say
shes the only person who actually knows
all the rules of Wikipedia so  And then theres monarchy and thats my role
on the community so  I was describing this in Berlin once and the next day
in the newspaper the headline said I am the Queen of England And thats not exactly what I said but  the point is my role in the community  Within the free software world
theres been a longstanding tradition of the benevolent dictator model So if you look at most
of the major free software projects they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees
is the benevolent dictator Well I dont like the term
benevolent dictator and I dont think that its my job
or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future
of all human knowledge compiled by the world It just isnt appropriate But there is a need still
for a certain amount of monarchy a certain amount of  sometimes we have to make a decision and we dont want
to get bogged down too heavily in formal decisionmaking processes So as an example
of how this can be important we recently had a situation where
a neoNazi website discovered Wikipedia and they said
Oh well this is horrible this Jewish conspiracy of a website and were going to get certain articles
deleted that we dont like And we see they have a voting process
so were going to send  we have  members
and were going to send them over and theyre all going to vote
and get these pages deleted Well they managed
to get  people to show up Thats neoNazi math for you They always think theyve got
 members when theyve got  But they managed to get  people
to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article Of course the vote ended up
being about  to  so there was no real danger
to our democratic processes On the other hand people said
But what are we going to do I mean this could happen What if some group
gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote Then I said Well fuck it
well just change the rules Thats my job in the community to say we wont allow
our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content And so as long as people
trust me in my role then thats a valid place for me Of course because of the free licensing if I do a bad job the volunteers
are more than happy to take and leave  I cant tell anyone what to do So the final point here
is that to understand how Wikipedia works its important to understand
that our wiki model is the way we work but we are not fanatical web anarchists In fact were very flexible
about the social methodology because ultimately
the passion of the community is for the quality of the work not necessarily for the process
that we use to generate it Thank you Ben Saunders Yeah hi Ben Saunders Jimmy you mentioned impartiality
being a key to Wikipedias success It strikes me that much of the textbooks
that are used to educate our children are inherently biased Have you found Wikipedia
being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia
changing education Jimmy Wales Yeah so a lot of teachers
are beginning to use Wikipedia Theres a media storyline about Wikipedia
which I think is false It builds on the storyline
of bloggers versus newspapers And the storyline is
theres this crazy thing Wikipedia but academics hate it
and teachers hate it And that turns out to not be true The last time I got an email
from a journalist saying Why do academics hate Wikipedia I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently
appointed a fellow there And I said Well
they dont all hate it But I think theres going
to be huge impacts And we actually have a project
that Im personally really excited about which is the Wikibooks project which is an effort to create
textbooks in all the languages And thats a much bigger project Its going to take  years or so
to come to fruition But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia
to every single person on the planet We dont mean were going
to Spam them with AOLstyle CDs We mean were going to give them
a tool that they can use And for a lot of people in the world if I give you an encyclopedia
thats written at a university level it doesnt do you any good
without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point
where you can actually use it The Wikibooks project
is an effort to do that And I think that were going to see 
it may not even come from us theres all kinds of innovation going on But freely licensed textbooks
are the next big thing in education ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

38,"Well its great to be here Weve heard a lot about the promise of technology and the peril Ive been quite interested in both If we could convert  percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy we could meet all of our projected needs for  We cant do that today because solar panels are heavy expensive and very inefficient There are nanoengineered designs which at least have been analyzed theoretically that show the potential to be very lightweight very inexpensive very efficient and wed be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way Nanoengineered fuel cells could provide the energy where its needed Thats a key trend which is decentralization moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption Bono spoke very eloquently that we have the tools for the first time to address ageold problems of disease and poverty Most regions of the world are moving in that direction In  in East Asia and the Pacific region there were  million people living in poverty  that number now is under  million The World Bank projects by  it will be under  million which is a reduction of  percent I did enjoy Bonos comment linking HaightAshbury to Silicon Valley Being from the Massachusetts hightech community myself Id point out that we were hippies also in the s although we hung around Harvard Square But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty and Im going to talk about those issues if we have the will Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology Thats been a strong interest of mine and a theme that Ive developed for some  years I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project That invariably the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology And I noticed that most inventions fail not because the RampD department cant get it to work  if you look at most business plans they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say theyre going to build  and  percent of those projects or more will fail because the timing is wrong  not all the enabling factors will be in place when theyre needed So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends and track where technology would be at different points in time and began to build the mathematical models of that Its kind of taken on a life of its own Ive got a group of  people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas and we build models And youll hear people say well we cant predict the future And if you ask me will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now thats very hard to say Will WiMax CDMA G be the wireless standard three years from now Thats hard to say But if you ask me what will it cost for one MIPS of computing in  or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in  or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in  it turns out that those are very predictable There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance capacity bandwidth And Im going to show you a small sample of this but theres really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion And a lot of people when they think about the future think about it linearly They think theyre going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using todays tools at todays pace of progress and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth The Genome Project was a controversial project in  We had our best PhD students our most advanced equipment around the world we got th of the project done so howre we going to get this done in  years And  years into the project the skeptics were still going strong  says Youre twothirds through this project and youve managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome But its the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve it explodes Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project It took us  years to sequence HIV  we sequenced SARS in  days So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems Im going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is The actual paradigmshift rate the rate of adopting new ideas is doubling every decade according to our models These are all logarithmic graphs so as you go up the levels it represents generally multiplying by factor of  or  It took us half a century to adopt the telephone the first virtualreality technology Cell phones were adopted in about eight years If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph television radio telephone were adopted in decades Recent technologies  like the PC the web cell phones  were under a decade Now this is an interesting chart and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process  and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes  accelerate They work through interaction  they create a capability and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage So the first step in biological evolution the evolution of DNA  actually it was RNA came first  took billions of years but then evolution used that informationprocessing backbone to bring on the next stage So the Cambrian Explosion when all the body plans of the animals were evolved took only  million years It was  times faster And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions and biological evolution kept accelerating Its an inherent nature of an evolutionary process So Homo sapiens the first technologycreating species the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage  and by the way chimpanzees dont really have a very good opposable thumb  so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology But anyway the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years and then working through interaction evolution used essentially the technologycreating species to bring on the next stage which were the first steps in technological evolution And the first step took tens of thousands of years  stone tools fire the wheel  kept accelerating We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation Printing press took a century to be adopted the first computers were designed penonpaper  now we use computers And weve had a continual acceleration of this process Now by the way if you look at this on a linear graph it looks like everything has just happened but some observer says Well Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line So I took  different lists from key thinkers like the Encyclopedia Britannica the Museum of Natural History Carl Sagans Cosmic Calendar on the same  and these people were not trying to make my point these were just lists in reference works and I think thats what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution And again it forms the same straight line You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements what the key points are theres differences of opinion when agriculture started or how long the Cambrian Explosion took But you see a very clear trend Theres a basic profound acceleration of this evolutionary process Information technologies double their capacity price performance bandwidth every year And thats a very profound explosion of exponential growth A personal experience when I was at MIT  computer taking up about the size of this room less powerful than the computer in your cell phone But Moores Law which is very often identified with this exponential growth is just one example of many because its basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology I put  famous computers on this logarithmic graph  by the way a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth  thats another exponential It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in  two years in the middle were now doubling it every one year And thats exponential growth through five different paradigms Moores Law was just the last part of that where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit but we had electromechanical calculators relaybased computers that cracked the German Enigma Code vacuum tubes in the s predicted the election of Eisenhower discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moores Law Every time one paradigm ran out of steam another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth They were shrinking vacuum tubes making them smaller and smaller That hit a wall They couldnt shrink them and keep the vacuum Whole different paradigm  transistors came out of the woodwork In fact when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm And because weve been predicting the end of Moores Law for quite a long time  the first prediction said  until now it says  But by the teen years the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width and we wont be able to shrink them any more Thatll be the end of Moores Law but it wont be the end of the exponential growth of computing because chips are flat We live in a threedimensional world we might as well use the third dimension We will go into the third dimension and theres been tremendous progress just in the last few years of getting threedimensional selforganizing molecular circuits to work Well have those ready well before Moores Law runs out of steam Supercomputers  same thing Processor performance on Intel chips the average price of a transistor   you could buy one transistor for a dollar You could buy  million in  Its pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is I mean youd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior  countries accusing each other of dumping products IPOs bankruptcies marketing programs You would think it would be a very erratic process and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process Just as we cant predict what one molecule in a gas will do  its hopeless to predict a single molecule  yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas using thermodynamics very accurately Its the same thing here We cant predict any particular project but the result of this whole worldwide chaotic unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable And we can predict these trends far into the future Unlike Gertrude Steins roses its not the case that a transistor is a transistor As we make them smaller and less expensive the electrons have less distance to travel Theyre faster so youve got exponential growth in the speed of transistors so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of  years You add other forms of innovation and processor design you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year And thats basically deflation   percent deflation And its not just computers I mean its true of DNA sequencing its true of brain scanning its true of the World Wide Web I mean anything that we can quantify we have hundreds of different measurements of different informationrelated measurements  capacity adoption rates  and they basically double every    months depending on what youre looking at In terms of price performance thats a  to  percent deflation rate And economists have actually started worrying about that 
 We had deflation during the Depression but that was collapse of the money supply collapse of consumer confidence a completely different phenomena This is due to greater productivity but the economist says But theres no way youre going to be able to keep up with that If you have  percent deflation people may increase their volume   percent but they wont keep up with it But what were actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it Weve had  percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last  years I mean people didnt build iPods for  dollars  years ago As the price performance makes new applications feasible new applications come to the market And this is a very widespread phenomena Magnetic data storage  thats not Moores Law its shrinking magnetic spots different engineers different companies same exponential process A key revolution is that were understanding our own biology in these information terms Were understanding the software programs that make our body run These were evolved in very different times  wed like to actually change those programs One little software program called the fat insulin receptor gene basically says Hold onto every calorie because the next hunting season may not work out so well That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago Wed like to actually turn that program off They tried that in animals and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim They didnt get diabetes they didnt get heart disease they lived  percent longer they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this felt that would be interesting drug for the human market and thats just one of the  genes that affect our biochemistry We were evolved in an era where it wasnt in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference like myself to live much longer because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them So life  long lifespans  like that is to say much more than   werent selected for but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution For example we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome Theres actually a  for the first time now something going to human trials that actually cures pulmonary hypertension  a fatal disease  using gene therapy So well have not just designer babies but designer baby boomers And this technology is also accelerating It cost  dollars per base pair in  then a penny in  Its now under a th of a cent The amount of genetic data  basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year enabling the genome project to be completed Another major revolution the communications revolution The price performance bandwidth capacity of communications measured many different ways wired wireless is growing exponentially The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to measured many different ways This is based on the number of hosts Miniaturization  were shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate both wired and wireless These are some designs from Eric Drexlers book  which were now showing are feasible with supercomputing simulations where actually there are scientists building moleculescale robots One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly humanlike gait thats built out of molecules There are little machines doing things in experimental bases The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions And this is less futuristic than it may sound These things have already been done in animals Theres one nanoengineered device that cures type  diabetes Its blood cellsized They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell  they tried this in rats  it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion and actually cures type  diabetes What youre watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very suboptimal even though its remarkable in its intricacy Once we understand its principles of operation and the pace with which we are reverseengineering biology is accelerating we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable An analysis of this respirocyte designed by Rob Freitas indicates if you replace  percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions you could do an Olympic sprint for  minutes without taking a breath You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours  so Honey Im in the pool will take on a whole new meaning It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials Presumably well ban them but then well have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely outperforming the Olympic athletes Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell These are circa scenarios but theyre not as futuristic as it may sound There are four major conferences on building blood cellsized devices there are many experiments in animals Theres actually one going into human trial so this is feasible technology If we come back to our exponential growth of computing  dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the s but thatll be the hardware side of the equation Where will we get the software Well it turns out we can see inside the human brain and in fact not surprisingly the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year And with the new generation of scanning tools for the first time we can actually see individual interneural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time  but then the question is OK we can get this data now but can we understand it Doug Hofstadter wonders well maybe our intelligence just isnt great enough to understand our intelligence and if we were smarter well then our brains would be that much more complicated and wed never catch up to it It turns out that we can understand it This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well  in applying psychoacoustic tests gets very similar results to human auditory perception Theres another simulation of the cerebellum  thats more than half the neurons in the brain  again works very similarly to human skill formation This is at an early stage but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning we will succeed in reverseengineering the human brain by the s Weve already had very good models and simulation of about  regions out of the several hundred All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress Weve had productivity go from  dollars to  dollars per hour of labor in the last  years Ecommerce has been growing exponentially Its now a trillion dollars You might wonder well wasnt there a boom and a bust That was strictly a capitalmarkets phenomena Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology which it was but then six months later when it hadnt revolutionized all business models they figured well that was wrong and then we had this bust All right this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies were involved in This will be a routine feature in a cell phone It would be able to translate from one language to another So let me just end with a couple of scenarios By  computers will disappear Theyll be so small theyll be embedded in our clothing in our environment Images will be written directly to our retina providing fullimmersion virtual reality augmented real reality Well be interacting with virtual personalities But if we go to  we really have the full maturity of these trends and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology which are getting faster and faster well have at that point I mean we will have twotothethpower greater price performance capacity and bandwidth of these technologies which is pretty phenomenal Itll be millions of times more powerful than it is today Well have completed the reverseengineering of the human brain  dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity Computers will combine the subtle panrecognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior in terms of doing analytic thinking remembering billions of facts accurately Machines can share their knowledge very quickly But its not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines We are going to merge with our technology These nanobots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications cleaning up the environment providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment But theyll also go inside our brain interact with our biological neurons Weve demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this So for example fullimmersion virtual reality from within the nervous system the nanobots shut down the signals coming from your real senses replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment and then itll feel like youre in that virtual environment You can go there with other people have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses Experience beamers I call them will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet You can plug in and experience what its like to be someone else But most importantly itll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology which in some sense were doing already We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology Human life expectancy is expanding It was  in  and with this sort of biotechnology nanotechnology revolutions this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead My main message is that progress in technology is exponential not linear Many  even scientists  assume a linear model so theyll say Oh itll be hundreds of years before we have selfreplicating nanotechnology assembly or artificial intelligence If you really look at the power of exponential growth youll see that these things are pretty soon at hand And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials Well be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the s from information in very inexpensive raw materials using nanotechnology These are very powerful technologies They both empower our promise and our peril So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

39, minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit so Im going to dive straight in right at the point where I get this thing to work Here we go Im going to talk about five different things Im going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable Im going to talk about why we have to get our shit together and actually talk about this a bit more than we do Im going to talk about feasibility as well of course Im going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging And then Im going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it Im going to do that in two steps The first one Im going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension  which Im going to define as  years applied to people who are already in middleage when you start  to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging Namely essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year  or indeed to get sick in the first place And of course the last thing Im going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step that point of maybe  years life extension So Im going to start with why we should Now I want to ask a question Hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria That was easy OK OK Hands up anyone in the audience whos not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing OK So we all think malaria is a bad thing Thats very good news because I thought that was what the answer would be Now the thing is I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging And here is that characteristic The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does Now I like in an audience in Britain especially to talk about the comparison with foxhunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle by the government not very many months ago I mean I know Im with a sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic And this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me You know a lot of people said Well you know city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time Its a traditional part of the way of life and we should be allowed to carry on doing it Its ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes But ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the British public and certainly the majority of members of Parliament came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades What part of this do people not understand Its not just about life of course  Laughter  its about healthy life you know  getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun whether or not dying may be fun So really this is how I would like to describe it Its a global trance These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging And I mean OK Im not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless There are some good points to be made here things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too  well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging But these are completely crazy when you actually remember your sense of proportion You know these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about But the question is are they so dangerous  these risks of doing something about aging  that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning  people a day to an unnecessarily early death You know if you havent got an argument thats that strong then just dont waste my time is what I say Now there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong and here it is People worry about overpopulation they say Well if we fix aging no ones going to die to speak of or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing St Giles carelessly And therefore were not going to be able to have many kids and kids are really important to most people And thats true And you know a lot of people try to fudge this question and give answers like this I dont agree with those answers I think they basically dont work I think its true that we will face a dilemma in this respect We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate or a high death rate A high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids And I say that thats fine  the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice Whats not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future If we vacillate hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies then we are condemning a whole cohort of people  who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies but will not be because we havent developed them as quickly as we could  well be denying those people an indefinite life span and I consider that that is immoral Thats my answer to the overpopulation question Right So the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this And the fundamental answer is that the proaging trance is not as dumb as it looks Its actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging Aging is ghastly but its inevitable so you know weve got to find some way to put it out of our minds and its rational to do anything that we might want to do to do that Like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all But of course that only works when we have both of these components And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear  and we might be in range of doing something about aging  this becomes part of the problem This proaging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things And thats why we have to really talk about this a lot  evangelize I will go so far as to say quite a lot  in order to get peoples attention and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard So thats all Im going to say about that Im now going to talk about feasibility And the fundamental reason I think why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that Im giving here A very simple definition Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place which is to say metabolism This is not a completely tautological statement its a reasonable statement Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever selfrepair mechanisms because those selfrepair mechanisms are not perfect So basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next has side effects Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology Thats a fine definition So we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of events And there are really two games in town according to most people with regard to postponing aging Theyre what Im calling here the gerontology approach and the geriatrics approach The geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon Of course its a very shorttermist strategy its a losing battle because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface because you know prevention is better than cure But unfortunately the thing is that we dont understand metabolism very well In fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work  even cells were not really too good on yet Weve discovered things like for example RNA interference only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work Basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when were talking about intervention So then what do we do about that I mean thats a fine logic that sounds pretty convincing pretty ironclad doesnt it But it isnt Before I tell you why it isnt Im going to go a little bit into what Im calling step two Just suppose as I said that we do acquire  lets say we do it today for the sake of argument  the ability to confer  extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age lets say  Im going to call that robust human rejuvenation OK What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today  or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive  would actually live In order to answer that question  you might think its simple but its not simple We cant just say Well if theyre young enough to benefit from these therapies then theyll live  years longer Thats the wrong answer And the reason its the wrong answer is because of progress There are two sorts of technological progress really for this purpose There are fundamental major breakthroughs and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs Now they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames Fundamental breakthroughs very hard to predict how long its going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun and it took us until  to actually work out how to do it But after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight We can think really that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough And you see it in all sorts of technologies Computers you can look at a more or less parallel time line happening of course a bit later You can look at medical care I mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics  you know the same sort of time frame So I think that actually step two that I called a step a moment ago isnt a step at all That in fact the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension even though those people are already middleaged when the therapies arrive will be at some sort of cusp They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further  or maybe  years In other words they will be staying ahead of the game The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us This is a very important point for me to get across Because you know most people when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to  or more they think that Im saying that were going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to  or more Im not saying that at all Im saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough Theyll never be perfect but well be able to fix the things that yearolds die of before we have any yearolds And the same for  and  and so on I decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity Well it seems to get the point across So these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive If youre already  or even if youre   and an average yearold we probably cant do a lot for you with these therapies because youre too close to deaths door for the really initial experimental therapies to be good enough for you You wont be able to withstand them But if youre only  then theres a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and you know  Laughter  eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from agerelated causes And of course if youre a bit younger than that then youre never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of agerelated causes So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to that the first yearold  we dont know how old that person is today because we dont know how long its going to take to get these firstgeneration therapies But irrespective of that age Im claiming that the first person to live to   subject of course to you know global catastrophes  is actually probably only about  years younger than the first yearold And thats quite a thought Alright so finally Im going to spend the rest of the talk my last sevenandahalf minutes on step one namely how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity And in order to do that I need to talk about mice a little bit I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation Im calling it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively And this is what it is I say were going to take a longlived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average We do exactly nothing to them until theyre already two years old And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies we get them to live on average to their fifth birthday So in other words we add two years  we treble their remaining lifespan starting from the point that we started the therapies The question then is what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans Which we can now as Ive explained equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity Secondly what does it mean for the publics perception of how long its going to take for us to get to those things starting from the time we get the mice And thirdly the question is what will it do to actually how much people want it And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and its extremely hard to answer One has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more I say thats nonsense I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this We need to give our best guess as to the time frame in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities So I say that we have a  chance of reaching this RHR milestone robust human rejuvenation within  years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation  years from the robust mouse The publics perception will probably be somewhat better than that The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are So theyll probably think its five years away Theyll be wrong but that actually wont matter too much And finally of course I think its fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier the coping strategy That will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since its been postponed so very effectively in mice So were likely to end up with a very strong change in peoples attitudes and of course that has enormous implications So in order to tell you now how were going to get these mice Im going to add a little bit to my description of aging Im going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology the damage itself is caused ongoingly throughout life starting before were born But it is not part of metabolism itself And this turns out to be useful Because we can redraw our original diagram this way We can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage And Im going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology And the reason its a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate So theres a third approach if we look at it this way We can call it the engineering approach and I claim that the engineering approach is within range The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes It does not intervene in this process or this one And thats good because it means that its not a losing battle and its something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesnt involve improving on evolution The engineering approach simply says Lets go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage  not necessarily repair them completely but repair them quite a lot so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes it to be pathogenic We know that this threshold exists because we dont get agerelated diseases until were in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born Why do I say that were in range Well this is basically it The point about this slide is actually the bottom If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging we will be here all night because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another This list is just for illustration it is incomplete The list on the right is also incomplete Its a list of types of pathology that are agerelated and its just an incomplete list But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete  this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathology And there are only seven of them Theyre categories of things of course but theres only seven of them Cell loss mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on First of all Id like to give you an argument for why that list is complete Of course one can make a biological argument One can say OK what are we made of Were made of cells and stuff between cells What can damage accumulate in The answer is longlived molecules because if a shortlived molecule undergoes damage but then the molecule is destroyed  like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis  then the damage is gone too Its got to be longlived molecules So these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news because it means that you know weve come a long way in biology in these  years so the fact that we havent extended this list is a pretty good indication that theres no extension to be done However its better than that we actually know how to fix them all in mice in principle  and what I mean by in principle is we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade Some of them are partially implemented already the ones at the top I havent got time to go through them at all but my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only  years but we do need to get serious about it We do need to really start trying So of course there are some biologists in the audience and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have You may have been dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff Ive published a great deal on this I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based and theres quite a lot of detail there The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that Im predicting here So if you think that Im wrong youd better damn well go and find out why you think Im wrong And of course the main thing is that you shouldnt trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously So you know youve got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true And well just end with a few things One thing is you know youll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time and everyone said Well its obviously impossible And you know what happened So you know this does happen We have various strategies  theres the Methuselah Mouse Prize which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do what you think is going to work and you get money for it if you win Theres a proposal to actually put together an institute This is whats going to take a bit of money But I mean look  how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq Not very long OK Its got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but its basically got a  percent chance I think of succeeding in this And I think we know how to do it And Ill stop there Thank you Chris Anderson OK I dont know if theres going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance Audience Since youve been talking about aging and trying to defeat it why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man AG Because I am an old man I am actually  Audience Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate However as far as I know all the species have evolved to actually die so when cells divide the telomerase get shorter and eventually species die So why does  evolution has  seems to have selected against immortality when it is so advantageous or is evolution just incomplete AG Brilliant Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer Im going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question which I happen to agree with which is that no aging is not a product of selection evolution aging is simply a product of evolutionary neglect In other words we have aging because its hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathways more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly and that carries on being true the longer you push it out So to the extent that evolution doesnt matter doesnt care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation theres a certain amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different lifespans but thats why there are no immortal species CA The genes dont care but we do AG Thats right Audience Hello I read somewhere that in the last  years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by  years If I project that that would make me think that I would live until  if I dont crash on my motorbike That means that Im one of your subjects to become a yearold AG If you lose a bit of weight Your numbers are a bit out The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade So its not quite as good as you might think you might hope But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible Audience I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last  years or so If that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation If there are cells in my body that live all  years as opposed to a typical you know couple of months AG There are technical implications certainly Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate especially neurons but we dont want to replace them any faster than that  or not much faster anyway because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function What I said about there being no nonaging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification There are species that have no aging  Hydra for example  but they do it by not having a nervous system  and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very longlived cells ,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

40,Natures my muse and its been my passion As a photographer for National Geographic Ive portrayed it for many But five years ago I went on a personal journey I wanted to visualize the story of life Its the hardest thing Ive ever attempted and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out But there were also revelations And one of those Id like to share with you today I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago back before the sky turned blue Theres stromatolites down there  the first living things to capture photosynthesis  and its the only place they still occur today Going down there was like entering a time capsule and I came out with a different sense of myself in time The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today Stromatolites are the heroes in my story I hope its a story that has some resonance for our time Its a story about you and me nature and science And with that said Id like to invite you for a short brief journey of life through time Our journey starts in space where matter condenses into spheres over time  solidifying into surface molded by fire The fire gave way Earth emerged  but this was an alien planet The moon was closer things were different Heat from within made geysers erupt  that is how the oceans were born Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth Water is the key to life but in frozen form it is a latent force And when it vanishes Earth becomes Mars But this planet is different  its roiling inside And where that energy touches water something new emerges life It arises around cracks in the Earth Mud and minerals become substrate there are bacteria Learn to multiply thickening in places  Growing living structures under an alien sky  Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen And they changed the atmosphere A breath thats fossilized now as iron Meteorites delivered chemistry and perhaps membranes too Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate These are diatoms singlecelled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon  circuit boards of the future Shallow seas nurtured life early on and thats where it morphed into more complex forms It grew as light and oxygen increased Life hardened and became defensive It learned to move and began to see The first eyes grew on trilobites Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs among the first to leave the sea They still do what theyve done for ages their enemies long gone Scorpions follow prey out of the sea Slugs became snails Fish tried amphibian life Frogs adapted to deserts Lichens arose as a coop Fungi married algae  clinging to rock and eating it too  transforming barren land True land plants arose leafless at first Once they learn how to stay upright they grew in size and shape The fundamental forms of ferns followed to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds Life flourished in swamps On land life turned a corner Jaws formed first teeth came later Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era It took time for life to break away from water and it still beckons all the time Life turned hard so it could venture inland And the dragons that arose are still among us today Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar and the center of Brazil where plants called cycads remain rock hard Forests arose and nurtured things with wings One early form left an imprint like it died only yesterday And others fly today like echoes of the past In birds life gained new mobility Flamingos covered continents Migrations got underway Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants Water lilies were among the first Plants began to diversify and grew turning into trees In Australia a lily turned into a grass tree and in Hawaii a daisy became a silver sword In Africa Gondwana molded Proteas But when that ancient continent broke up life got lusher Tropical rainforests arose sparking new layers of interdependence Fungi multiplied Orchids emerged genitalia shaped to lure insects  a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth Coevolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever When birds cant fly they become vulnerable Kiwis are and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica Extinction can come slowly but sometimes it arrives fast An asteroid hits and the world went down in flames But there were witnesses survivors in the dark When the skies cleared a new world was born A world fit for mammals From tiny shrews came tenrecs accustomed to the dark New forms became bats Civets New predators hyenas getting faster and faster still Grasslands created opportunities Herd safety came with sharpened senses Growing big was another answer but size always comes at a price Some mammals turned back to water Walruses adapted with layers of fat Sea lions got sleek And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds There are many ways to be a mammal A roo hops in Oz a horse runs in Asia and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil Primates emerge from jungles as tarsiers first becoming lemurs not much later Learning became reinforced Bands of apes ventured into the open And forests dried out once more Going upright became a lifestyle So who are we Brothers of masculine chimps sisters of feminine bonobos We are all of them and more Were molded by the same life force The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth And our brains  our celebrated brains  reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh Life is a force in its own right It is a new element And it has altered the Earth It covers Earth like a skin And where it doesnt as in Greenland in winter Mars is still not very far But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again And where water is liquid it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll  and that molecular marvel is whats made a difference  it powers everything The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae and their waste is our breath and vice versa This Earth is alive and its made its own membrane We call it atmosphere This is the icon of our journey And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next Thank you Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

41,"Ive been at MIT for  years I went to TED I Theres only one other person here
I think who did that All the other TEDs  and I went to them all
under Rickys regime  I talked about
what the Media Lab was doing which today has almost  people in it And if you read the press last week it actually said
I quit the Media Lab I didnt quit the Media Lab
I stepped down as chairman  which was a kind of ridiculous title
but someone else has taken it on  and one of the things
you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor And I will now do for the rest of my life
the One Laptop Per Child which Ive sort of been doing
for a year and a half anyway So Im going to tell you about this use my  minutes
to tell you why were doing it how were doing it
and then what were doing And at some point Ill even pass around what the  laptop might be like I was asked by Chris
to talk about some of the big issues and so I figured Id start with the three
that at least drove me to do this And the first is pretty obvious Its amazing when you meet
a head of state and you say What is your most precious
natural resource They will not say children at first and then when you say children
they will pretty quickly agree with you And so that isnt very hard Everybody agrees that whatever
the solutions are to the big problems they include education
sometimes can be just education and can never be without
some element of education So thats certainly part of it And the third
is a little bit less obvious And that is that we all in this room
learned how to walk how to talk not by being taught how to talk
or taught how to walk but by interacting with the world by having certain results as a consequence
of being able to ask for something or being able to stand up and reach it Whereas at about the age six
we were told to stop learning that way and that all learning from then on
would happen through teaching whether its people standing up
like Im doing now or a book or something But it was really through teaching And one of the things in general
that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more
like walking and talking in the sense that a lot of it is driven
by the learner himself or herself So with those as the principles  some of you may know Seymour Papert This is back in 
when we were working in Senegal Because some people think that
the  laptop just happened a year ago or two years ago
or we were struck by lightning  this actually has gone back a long time
and in fact back to the s Here were in the s Steve Jobs had given us some laptops
We were in Senegal It didnt scale but it at least was bringing computers
to developing countries and learning pretty quickly
that these kids even though English wasnt their language the Latin alphabet
barely was their language but they could just swim like fish They could play these like pianos A little bit more recently
I got involved personally And these are two anecdotes  one was in Cambodia in a village that has no electricity
no water no television no telephone but has broadband Internet now And these kids
their first English word is Google and they only know Skype Theyve never heard of telephony They just use Skype And they go home at night  theyve got a broadband connection
in a hut that doesnt have electricity The parents love it
because when they open up the laptops its the brightest light source
in the house And talk about
where metaphors and reality mix  this is the actual school In parallel with this
Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child
in the year  Now at the time I think its fair to say
that  percent of the teachers were  let me say apprehensive Really they were actually against it And they really preferred
that the money would be used for higher salaries
more schools whatever And now three and a half
years later guess what Theyre reporting five things
drop of truancy to almost zero attending parentteacher meetings  which nobody did
and now almost everybody does  drop in discipline problems
increase in student participation Teachers are now saying
its kind of fun to teach Kids are engaged  they have laptops  and then the fifth
which interests me the most is that the servers have to be turned off
at certain times at night because the teachers
are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help So when you see that kind of thing  this is not something
that you have to test The days of pilot projects are over
when people say Wed like to do three or four thousand
in our country to see how it works Screw you Go to the back of the line
and someone else will do it and then when you figure out
that this works you can join as well And this is what were doing Laughter Applause So One Laptop Per Child
was formed about a year and a half ago Its a nonprofit association It raised about  million dollars to do the engineering
to just get this built and then have it produced afterwards Scale is truly important And its not important because you can
buy components at a lower price OK Its because you can go
to a manufacturer  and I will leave the name out  but we wanted a small display doesnt have to have
perfect color uniformity It can even have a pixel or two missing It doesnt have to be that bright And this particular manufacturer said Were not interested in that
Were interested in the living room Were interested
in perfect color uniformity Were interested in big displays
bright displays Youre not part of our strategic plan And I said Thats kind of too bad
because we need  million units a year And they said Oh well maybe we could
become part of your strategic plan And thats why scale counts And thats why we will not launch this without five to  million units
in the first run And the idea is
to launch with enough scale that the scale itself
helps bring the price down and thats why I said
seven to  million there And were doing it
without a salesandmarketing team I mean youre looking
at the salesandmarketing team We will do it by going
to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it and then the others can follow We have partners Its not hard to guess
Google would be one The others are all playing to pending And this has been
in the press a great deal Its the socalled Green Machine
that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit
that was held in Tunisia Now once people start looking at this
they say Ah this is a laptop project Well no its not a laptop project
Its an education project And the fun part 
and Im quite focused on it  I tell people I used to be a light bulb
but now Im a laser  Im just going to get that thing built
and it turns out its not so hard Because laptop economics
are the following I say  percent here 
its more like   percent of the cost of your laptop is sales marketing
distribution and profit Now we have none of those OK None of those figure into our cost because first of all we sell it at cost
and the governments distribute it It gets distributed
to the school system like a textbook So that piece disappears Then you have display and everything else Now the display on your laptop costs in rough numbers
 dollars a diagonal inch That can drop to eight
it can drop to seven but its not going to drop to two
or to one and a half unless we do some pretty clever things Its the rest  that little brown box 
that is pretty fascinating because the rest of your laptop
is devoted to itself Its a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy
to move their obesity And we have a situation today
which is incredible Ive been using laptops
since their inception And my laptop runs slower
less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before And this year is worse People clap sometimes
you even get standing ovations and I say What the hells wrong
with you Why are we all sitting there And somebody  to remain nameless 
called our laptop a gadget recently And I said God our laptops going to go
like a bat out of hell When you open it up
its going to go bing Itll be on Itll be just like it was in  when you bought an Apple Macintosh  It worked really well And weve been going steadily downhill Now people ask all the time what it is Thats what it is The two pieces that are probably notable
itll be a mesh network so when the kids open up their laptops
they all become a network and then just need
one or two points of backhaul You can serve a couple of thousand kids
with two megabits So you really can bring into a village and then the villages
can connect themselves and you really can do it quite well The dual mode display  the idea is to have a display
that both works outdoors  isnt it fun using your cell phone
outdoors in the sunlight Well you cant see it And one of the reasons you cant see it is because its backlighting
most of the time most cell phones Now what were doing is were doing one
that will be both frontlit and backlit And whether you manually switch it
or you do it in the software is to be seen But when its backlit its color And when its frontlit
its black and white at three times the resolution Is it all worked out No Thats why a lot of our people are
more or less living in Taiwan right now And in about  days
well know for sure whether this works Probably the most important piece there is that the kids
really can do the maintenance And this is again something
that people dont believe but I really think its quite true Thats the machine we showed in Tunis This is more the direction
that were going to go And its something
that we didnt think was possible Now Im going to pass this around This isnt a design OK So this is just a mechanical
engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with And its clearly just a model The working one is at MIT Im going to pass it
to this handsome gentleman At least you can decide
whether it goes left or  Chris Anderson Before you do it
for the people down in simulcast  Nicholas Negroponte Sorry I forgot
CA Just show it off a bit So wherever the camera is 
OK good point Thank you Chris The idea was that
it would be not only a laptop but that it could transform
into an electronic book So its sort of an electronic book This is where when you go outside
its in black and white The games buttons are missing but itll also be a games machine book machine Set it up this way
and its a television set Etc etc  is that enough
for simulcast OK sorry Ill let Jim decide
which way to send it afterwards OK Seven countries I say maybe for Massachusetts
because they actually have to do a bid By law youve got to bid
and so on and so forth So I cant quite name them In the other cases
they dont have to do bids They can decide  its the federal government in each case Its kind of agonizing because a lot of people say
Lets do it at the state level because states are more nimble
than the feds just because of size And yet we count Were really dealing
with the federal government Were really dealing
with ministries of education And if you look at governments
around the world ministries of education
tend to be the most conservative and also the ones that have huge payrolls Everybody thinks
they know about education a lot of culture is built into it as well Its really hard
And so its certainly the hard road If you look at the countries
theyre pretty geoculturally distributed Have they all agreed No not completely Probably Thailand Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are
the most active and most agreed Were purposely
not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones And since I visit
each one of those countries within at least every three months Im just going around the world
every three weeks Heres sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some
away free in two years at this meeting Everybody says its a  laptop  you cant do it Well guess what were not Were coming in probably at 
to start then drift down And thats very important because so many things hit the market
at a price and then drift up Its kind of the loss leader and then as soon as it looks interesting it cant be afforded
or it cant be scaled out So were targeting  dollars in  The gray markets a big issue And one of the ways  just one  but one of the ways to help
in the case of the gray market is to make something
that is so utterly unique  Its a little bit like the fact
that automobiles  thousands of automobiles
are stolen every day in the United States Not one single
postoffice truck is stolen And why Because theres no market
for postoffice trucks It looks like a postoffice truck You can spray paint it
You can do anything you want I just learned recently in South Africa
no white Volvos are stolen Period None Zero So we want to make it
very much like a white Volvo Each government has a task force This perhaps is less interesting but were trying to get the governments
to all work together and its not easy The economics of this
is to start with the federal governments and then later
to subsequently go to other  whether its childtochild funding so a child in this country buys one
for a child in the developing world maybe of the same gender
maybe of the same age An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that
as a birthday present I mean there are all sorts of things
that will happen and theyll be very very exciting And everybody says  I say 
its an education project Are we providing the software The answer is The system certainly has software but no were not providing
the education content That is really done in the countries But we are certainly constructionists And we certainly believe
in learning by doing and everything from Logo
which was started in  to more modern things like Scratch
if youve ever even heard of it are very very much part of it And thats the rollout Are we dreaming Is this real It actually is real The only criticism and people
really dont want to criticize this because it is a humanitarian effort
a nonprofit effort and to criticize it
is a little bit stupid actually But the one thing
that people could criticize was Great idea but these guys cant do it And that could either mean these guys
professors and so on couldnt do it or that its not possible Well on December  a company
called Quanta agreed to build it and since they make about onethird
of all the laptops on the planet today that question disappeared So its not a matter
of whether its going to happen It is going to happen And if it comes out
at  dollars so what If it comes out six months late so what Thats a pretty soft landing Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

42,If you take  people at random  have something in common their interests in business lie on or near the Earths surface The odd one out is an astronomer and I am one of that strange breed My talk will be in two parts Ill talk first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race But lets start off by remembering that Darwin showed how were the outcome of four billion years of evolution And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwins simple beginning to set our Earth in a cosmic context And let me just run through a few slides This was the impact that happened last week on a comet If theyd sent a nuke it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday So thats another project for NASA Thats Mars from the European Mars Express and at New Year This artists impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan Saturns giant moon It landed on the surface This is pictures taken on the way down That looks like a coastline It is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane  the temperature minus  degrees centigrade If we go beyond our solar system weve learned that the stars arent twinkly points of light Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it And we can see places where stars are forming like the Eagle Nebula We see stars dying In six billion years the sun will look like that And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that On a still bigger scale we see entire galaxies of stars We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled And to the cosmologist these galaxies are just the atoms as it were of the largescale universe This picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about  patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky Through a small telescope this would look quite blank but you see here hundreds of little faint smudges Each is a galaxy fully like ours or Andromeda which looks so small and faint because its light has taken  billion lightyears to get to us The stars in those galaxies probably dont have planets around them Theres scant chance of life there  thats because theres been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and of life We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang  a hot dense state So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos Im going to show you a movie simulation  powers of  faster than real time which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out But you see as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small dense irregularities and structures develop And well end up after  billion years with something looking rather like our own universe And we compare simulated universes like that  Ill show you a better simulation at the end of my talk  with what we actually see in the sky Well we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang but we still dont know what banged and why it banged Thats a challenge for stcentury science If my research group had a logo it would be this picture here an ouroboros where you see the microworld on the left  the world of the quantum  and on the right the largescale universe of planets stars and galaxies We know our universes are united though  links between left and right The everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together And as weve learned in the last few years galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of socalled dark matter particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei But wed like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top The microworld of the quantum is understood On the right hand side gravity holds sway Einstein explained that But the unfinished business for stcentury science is to link together cosmos and microworld with a unified theory  symbolized as it were gastronomically at the top of that picture Laughter And until we have that synthesis we wont be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom quantum effects could shake everything And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small which we dont yet have One idea incidentally  and I had this hazard sign to say Im going to speculate from now on  is that our Big Bang was not the only one One idea is that our threedimensional universe may be embedded in a highdimensional space just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper You can imagine ants on one of them thinking its a twodimensional universe not being aware of another population of ants on the other So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours but were not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension and were imprisoned in our three And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what weve normally called our universe  the aftermath of our Big Bang And heres another picture Bottom right depicts our universe which on the horizon is not beyond that but even that is just one bubble as it were in some vaster reality Many people suspect that just as weve gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems one galaxy to many galaxies we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties Well lets go back to this picture Theres one challenge symbolized at the top but theres another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small but we want to understand the very complex And the most complex things are ourselves midway between atoms and stars We depend on stars to make the atoms were made of We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure We clearly have to be large compared to atoms to have layer upon layer of complex structure We clearly have to be small compared to stars and planets  otherwise wed be crushed by gravity And in fact we are midway It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is  kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here Well most of you anyway The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right And its this science which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world but also transforming our world faster than ever And more than that its engendering new kinds of change And I now move on to the second part of my talk and the book Our Final Century was mentioned If I was not a selfeffacing Brit I would mention the book myself and I would add that its available in paperback And in America it was called Our Final Hour because Americans like instant gratification But my theme is that in this century not only has science changed the world faster than ever but in new and different ways Targeted drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence perhaps even implants into our brains may change human beings themselves And human beings their physique and character has not changed for thousands of years It may change this century Its new in our history And the human impact on the global environment  greenhouse warming mass extinctions and so forth  is unprecedented too And so this makes this coming century a challenge Bio and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects while nonetheless reducing pressure on energy and resources But they will have a dark side In our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind on disaster Indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure  error rather than terror And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence In fact some years ago Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over etc I dont go along with all that but its interesting that he had a simple solution It was what he called finegrained relinquishment He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits Now thats absurdly naive for two reasons First any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones And also when a scientist makes a discovery he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science We have to accept that there will be hazards And I think we have to go back to what happened in the postWar era postWorld War II when the nuclear scientists whod been involved in making the atomic bomb in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers And they were inspired not by the young Einstein who did the great work in relativity but by the old Einstein the icon of poster and tshirt who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws He was premature But he was a moral compass  an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control And perhaps the greatest living person is someone Im privileged to know Joe Rothblatt Equally untidy office there as you can see Hes  years old and he founded the Pugwash movement He persuaded Einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell And he sets an example of the concerned scientist And I think to harness science optimally to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed we need latterday counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt We need not just campaigning physicists but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service or company employees subject to commercial pressure I wrote my book Our Final Century as a scientist just a general scientist But theres one respect I think in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective and thats that it offers an awareness of the immense future The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture  outside the American Bible Belt anyway  but most people even those who are familiar with evolution arent mindful that even more time lies ahead The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years but itll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out On that schematic picture a sort of timelapse picture were halfway And itll be another six billion before that happens and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized Theres an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there experiencing the suns demise but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on Earth and probably far beyond So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond If you represent the Earths lifetime by a single year say from January when it was made to December the stcentury would be a quarter of a second in June  a tiny fraction of the year But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective our century is very very special the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet As I should have shown this earlier it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria When Einstein died in  one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post The plaque reads Albert Einstein lived here And Id like to end with a vignette as it were inspired by this image Weve been familiar for  years with this image the fragile beauty of land ocean and clouds contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints But lets suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar not just for  years but for the entire  billionyear history of our Earth What would they have seen Over nearly all that immense time Earths appearance would have changed very gradually The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic supereruptions Apart from those brief traumas nothing happens suddenly The continental landmasses drifted around Ice cover waxed and waned Successions of new species emerged evolved and became extinct But in just a tiny sliver of the Earths history the last onemillionth part a few thousand years the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before This signaled the start of agriculture Change has accelerated as human populations rose Then other things happened even more abruptly Within just  years  thats one hundredth of one millionth of the Earths age  the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise and ominously fast The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves  the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions And something else happened Metallic objects  albeit very small ones a few tons at most  escaped into orbit around the Earth Some journeyed to the moons and planets A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earths final doom in another six billion years But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earths life These humaninduced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed If they continued their vigil what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years Will some spasm foreclose Earths future Or will the biosphere stabilize Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases a posthuman life elsewhere The science done by the young Einstein will continue as long as our civilization but for civilization to survive well need the wisdom of the old Einstein  humane global and farseeing And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth far beyond the Earth as depicted here Thank you very much ,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

43,Hello Actually thats hello in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants  the Big being the organization the system the country  and what the Small wants  the individual the person And how do you bring those two things together Charlie Ledbetter yesterday I thought talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things And thats what I want to talk about today So bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big I think is something that we believe in  something I believe in and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo I call this first chapter  for the Brits in the room  the Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious Often the good ideas are so staringatyourightintheface that you kind of miss them And I think a lot of times what we do is just sort of hold the mirror up to our clients and sort of go Duh You know look whats really going on And rather than talk about it in the theory I think Im just going to show you an example We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was And I think they were expecting  theyd worked with lots of consultants before  I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this that and the other and all kinds of mappy stuff Or even worse some kind of ghastly deathbyPowerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of you know God knows whatever The first thing we actually shared with them was this Ill play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve This is  seconds into the film This is a minute   I think something happens I think a head may appear in a second    We showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what is this And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day all you do is look at the roof and its a really shitty experience And just putting yourself in the position of the patient  this is Christian who works with us at Ideo He just lay in the hospital bed and kind of stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time Thats what its like to be a patient in the hospital And they were sort you know blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious Oh my goodness So looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out  as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in  was for these guys quite a revelation And so that was a really catalytic thing for them So they snapped into action They said OK its not about systemic change Its not about huge ridiculous things that we need to do Its about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we BandAided it here onto a gurney a hospital trolley so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor you could actually have a conversation with them You could kind of see them in your rearview mirror so it created a tiny human interaction Very small example of something that they could do Interestingly the nurses themselves sort of snapped into action  said OK we embrace this What can we do The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling Which I thought was really  I showed this to my mother recently I think my mother now thinks that Im some sort of interior decorator Its what I do for a living sort of Laurence LlewelynBowen Not particularly the worlds best design solution for those of us who are real sort of hardcore designers but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for people Things that they started doing themselves  like changing the floor going into the patients room so that it signified This is my room This is my personal space  was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem So you went from public space to private space And another idea again that came from one of the nurses  which I love  was they took traditional sort of corporate white boards then they put them on one wall of the patients room and they put this sticker there So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room which was lovely So tiny tiny tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact I thought that was a really really nice example So this is not particularly a new idea kind of seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution Its a history of invention based around this Im going to read this because I want to get these names right Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter  came down on a Saturday morning saw her daughter watching the test card waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship And he invented the shipping container George de Mestral  this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock  was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs sort of little prickly things and from that came Velcro And finally for the Brits Percy Shaw  this is a big British invention  saw the cats eyes at the side of the road when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye So theres a whole series of just using your eyes seeing things for the first time seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities Second one without sounding overly Zen and this is a quote from the Buddha Finding yourself in the margins looking to the edges of things is often a really interesting place to start Blinkered vision tends to produce I think blinkered solutions So looking wide using your peripheral vision is a really interesting place to look for opportunity Again another medical example here We were asked by a device producer  we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo  theyd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics This was a device that a nurse uses when theyre doing a spinal procedure in hospital Theyll ask the nurses to input data And they had this vision of the nurse kind of clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly sort of gadgetlustish When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place  and Ill explain this in a second  it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really werent recognizing When youre having a fourinch needle inserted into your spine  which was the procedure that this devices data was about it was for pain management  youre shit scared youre freaking out And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did was hold the patients hand to comfort them Human gesture  which made the fabulous twohanded data input completely impossible So the thing that we designed much less sexy but much more human and practical was this So its not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination but it has a thumbscroll so you can do everything with one hand So again going back to this  the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product And I think thats really really important So again this idea of workarounds We use this phrase workarounds a lot sort of looking around us I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while Ive been here This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life  and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential  is something that we look at a lot We wrote a book recently I think you might have received it called Thoughtless Acts Its been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do which have huge intention and huge opportunity Why do we all follow the line in the street This is a picture in a Japanese subway People consciously follow things even though why we dont know Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence Because we kind of have to  were just compelled to We dont know why but we do Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle Again were sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions And were always saying to our clients You should look at this stuff This stuff is really important This stuff is really vital This is people designing their own experiences You can draw from this We sort of assume that because theres a pole in the street that its okay to use it so we park our shopping cart there Its there for our use on some level So again we sort of coopt our environment to do all these different things We coopt other experiences  we take one item and transfer it to another And this is my favorite one My mother used to say to me Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesnt mean you have to But of course we all do We all follow each other every day So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something thats permission for them to do the same thing And theres almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time I mean shopping bag equals parking meter out of order And we all kind of know how to read these signals now We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what were doing Third section is this idea of not knowing of consciously putting yourself backwards I talk about unthinking situations all the time Sort of having beginners mind scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children This is the Billy bookcase  its IKEAs biggest selling product Hammer it together Hammer it together with a shoe if youre me because theyre impossible to assemble But big selling bookcase How do we replicate this for children The reality is when you actually watch children children dont think about things like storage in linear terms Children assume permission in a very different way Children live on things They live under things They live around things and so their spatial awareness relationship and their thinking around storage is totally different So the first thing you have to do  this is Graham the designer  is sort of put yourself in their shoes And so here he is sitting under the table So what came out of this This is the storage system that he designed So what is this I hear you all ask No I dont Its this and I think this is a particularly lovely solution So you know its a totally different way of looking at the situation Its a completely empathic solution  apart from the fact that teddys probably not loving it But a really nice way of reframing the ordinary and I think thats one of the things And putting yourself in the position of the person and I think thats one of the threads that Ive heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples shoes and really feel what they feel And then use that information to fuel solutions And I think thats what this is very much about Last section green armband Weve all got them Its about this really I mean its about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win Again thats one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is Where do we start How do we start What do we do to start So again we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC in Kenya Theyre now called KickStart And again as designers we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form And that was completely irrelevant When you put yourself in the position of these people things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle become much more relevant than the form of it The way its produced it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world So what seems like a very clunky product is in fact incredibly useful Its powered a bit like a Stairmaster  you pump up and down on it Children can use it Adults can use it Everybody uses it Its turning these guys  again one of the themes  its turning them into entrepreneurs These guys are using this very successfully And for us its been great because its won loads of design awards So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company the needs of the individuals in the company to feel good about a product we were actually designing and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for There it is pumping water from  feet So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning Weve made a donation on everybodys behalf here to kick start no pun intended their next project Because again I think sort of putting our money where our mouth is here We feel that this is an important gesture So weve handed out bracelets Small is the new big I hope youll all wear them So thats it Thank you

44,I want to talk today about  Ive been asked to take the long view and Im going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers which is encouraging It seems that theres not just one person who thinks that these problems are important The first is  death is a big problem If you look at the statistics the odds are not very favorable to us So far most people who have lived have also died Roughly  percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now So the annual death rate adds up to   sorry the daily death rate   people per day which is a huge number by any standard The annual death rate then becomes  million If we just look at the single biggest cause of death  aging  it accounts for roughly twothirds of all human people who die That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada Sometimes we dont see a problem because either its too familiar or its too big Cant see it because its too big I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem Once you think about it you see this is not statistical points these are  lets see how far have I talked Ive talked for three minutes So that would be roughly  people have died since Ive begun speaking People like  its roughly the population in this room has just died Now the human cost of that is obvious once you start to think about it  the suffering the loss  its also economically enormously wasteful I just look at the information and knowledge and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general and aging in particular Suppose we approximated one person with one book Now of course this is an underestimation A persons lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book But lets suppose we did this  million people die of natural causes each year corresponds then to  million volumes destroyed Library of Congress holds  million volumes We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria Its one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember even today But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress  burnt down forever lost  each year So thats the first big problem And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey and other people like him to try to do something about this as soon as possible Existential risk  the second big problem Existential risk is a threat to human survival or to the longterm potential of our species Now why do I say that this is a big problem Well lets first look at the probability  and this is very very difficult to estimate  but there have been only four studies on this in recent years which is surprising You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big but its a very neglected area But there have been four studies  one by John Lesley wrote a book on this He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century  percent Similarly the Astronomer Royal whom we heard speak yesterday also has a  percent probability estimate Another author doesnt give any numerical estimate but says the probability is significant that it will fail I wrote a long paper on this I said assigning a less than  percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have Now the exact figures here we should take with a big grain of salt but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees Now if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point  not very much  so thats equivalent to  million lives saved if we just count the currently living people the current generation Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to  million So thats a large number If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up then the figure becomes astronomical If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe  the Virgo supercluster  maybe it will take us  million years to get there but if we go extinct we never will Then even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number   to the power of  So if you take into account future generations as much as our own every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve And even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct it should still have a high priority Now let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem because its more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp Think about some time in your life  some people might never have experienced it  but some people there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic It might have been at the moment of some great creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage Or when you understood something you had never done before Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love Or an aesthetic experience  a sunset or a great piece of art Every once in a while we have these moments and we realize just how good life can be when its at its best And you wonder why cant it be like that all the time You just want to cling onto this And then of course it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades And its really difficult to recall in a normal frame of mind just how good life can be at its best Or how bad it can be at its worst The third big problem is that life isnt usually as wonderful as it could be I think thats a big big problem Its easy to say what we dont want Here are a number of things that we dont want  illness involuntary death unnecessary suffering cruelty stunted growth memory loss ignorance absence of creativity Suppose we fixed these things  we did something about all of these We were very successful We got rid of all of these things We might end up with something like this which is  I mean its a heck of a lot better than that But is this really the best we can dream of Is this the best we can do Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards And if we think about this I think its very clear that there are ways in which we could change things not just by eliminating negatives but adding positives On my wish list at least would be much longer healthier lives greater subjective wellbeing enhanced cognitive capacities more knowledge and understanding unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits better relationships an unbounded potential for spiritual moral and intellectual development If we want to achieve this what in the world would have to change And this is the answer  we would have to change Not just the world around us but we ourselves Not just the way we think about the world but the way we are  our very biology Human nature would have to change Now when we think about changing human nature the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies  growth hormone therapy cosmetic surgery stimulants like Ritalin Adderall antidepressants anabolic steroids artificial hearts Its a pretty pathetic list They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition but for most people they dont really transform what it is to be human And they also all seem a little bit  most people have this instinct that well sure there needs to be antidepressants for the really depressed people But theres a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way Its worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use We have skin enhancements clothing As far as I can see all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room so thats a great thing Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial  caffeine alcohol nicotine immune system enhancement vision enhancement anesthetics  we take that very much for granted but just think about how great progress that is  like having an operation before anesthetics was not fun Contraceptives cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques  that sounds ominous but the distinction between what is a technology  a gadget would be the archetype  and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read youre actually literally rewriting your own brain Youre changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along So in a broad sense we dont need to think about technology as only little gadgets like these things here but even institutions and techniques psychological methods and so forth Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature Looking ahead there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws laws of chemistry etc Its possible to assume setting aside a possibility of catastrophe that sooner or later we will develop all of these And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition So lets look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement Health span is a big and urgent thing because if youre not alive then all the other things will be to little avail Intellectual capacity  lets take that box which falls into a lot of different subcategories memory concentration mental energy intelligence empathy These are really great things Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people  theyre positional goods But part of the reason  and thats the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these  is that theyre also intrinsically valuable Its just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with and to remember what you have learned Modalities and special faculties Now the human mind is not a single unitary information processor but it has a lot of different special evolved modules that do specific things for us If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning  music humor eroticism spirituality aesthetics nurturing and caring gossip chatting with people  all of these very likely are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these Were just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it All of these would enable in principle  be amenable to enhancement Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have Its also interesting to think about what other things are  so if these all enabled great values why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be Imagine a species that just didnt have this neural machinery for processing music And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance like the one we just heard  because of people making stupid movements and they would be really irritated and wouldnt see what we were up to But maybe they have another faculty something else that would seem equally irrational to us but they actually tap into some great possible value there But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value So we could think of adding on different new sensory capacities and mental faculties Bodily functionality and morphology and affective selfcontrol Greater subjective wellbeing Be able to switch between relaxation and activity  being able to go slow when you need to do that and to speed up Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do  easier to achieve the flow state when youre totally immersed in something you are doing Conscientiousness and sympathy The ability to  its another interesting application that would have large social ramification perhaps If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person undiminished through time so that wouldnt have to  love would never have to fade if you didnt want it to Thats probably not all that difficult It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this Its been done in voles You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when its naturally polygamous Its just a single gene Might be more complicated in humans but perhaps not that much This is the last picture that I want to  now weve got to use the laser pointer A possible mode of being here would be a way of life  a way of being experiencing thinking seeing interacting with the world Down here in this little corner here we have the little subspace of this larger space that is accessible to human beings  beings with our biological capacities Its a part of the space thats accessible to animals since we are animals we are a subset of that And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for say  years Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are So then you move off to this larger sphere of human  and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being Now why is that a good thing to do Well we know already that in this little human circle there there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being  human life at its best is wonderful We have no reason to believe that within this much much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about And so to fix this third problem I think we need  slowly carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint  develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there Thanks ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

45,"Music Music ends Applause ends Hi everyone Im Sirena Im  years old and from Connecticut Audience cheers Well Im not really sure why Im here I mean what does this have to do
with technology entertainment and design Well I count my iPod
cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that So I did a little research on it Well this is what I found Of course I hope I can memorize it Clears throat The violin is made of a wood box
and four metal strings By pulling a string it vibrates
and produces a sound wave which passes through
a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box
and gets amplified but  let me think Placing your finger
at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length and that
changes the frequency of the sound wave Sighs Oh my gosh OK this is sort of technology but I can call it
a thcentury technology But actually the most
fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system
or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle
of producing and projecting sound Isnt that cool Design  I love its design I remember when I was little
my mom asked me Would you like to play
the violin or the piano I looked at that giant monster
and said to myself  I am not going to lock myself
on that bench the whole day This is small and lightweight I can play from standing
sitting or walking And you know what The best of all is that
if I dont want to practice Whispering I can hide it The violin is very beautiful Some people relate it
as the shape of a lady But whether you like it or not
its been so for more than  years unlike modern stuff
that easily looks dated But I think its very personal
and unique that although each violin looks pretty similar no two violins sound the same  even from the same maker
or based on the same model Entertainment  I love the entertainment But actually the instrument itself
isnt very entertaining I mean when I first got my violin
and tried to play around on it it was actually really bad because it didnt sound the way
Id heard from other kids  it was so horrible and so scratchy So it wasnt entertaining at all But besides my brother
found this very funny Yuk Yuk Yuk A few years later I heard a joke about the greatest violinist
Jascha Heifetz After Mr Heifetzs concert a lady came over and complimented him Oh Mr Heifetz your violin
sounded so great tonight And Mr Heifetz was a very cool person so he picked up his violin and said Funny  I dont hear anything Now I realize that as the musician we human beings with our great mind
artistic heart and skill can change this thcentury technology
and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment Now I know why Im here Music Music ends At first I thought I was just
going to be here to perform but unexpectedly I learned
and enjoyed much more But  although some of the talks
were quite up there for me Like the multidimension stuff I mean honestly Id be happy enough if I could actually get
my two dimensions correct in school But actually the most
impressive thing to me is that  well actually I would also like
to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults
for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better Thank you Music Music ends Applause ends Music Music ends ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

46,"Music Music ends Thank you Applause continues Thank you very much Like the speaker before me 
I am a TED virgin I guess Im also the first time here and  I dont know what to say Im really happy
that Mr Anderson invited me Im really grateful that I get a chance
to play for everyone And the song that I just played
was by Josef Hofmann Its called Kaleidoscope And Hofmann is a Polish pianist
and composer of the late th century and hes widely considered
one of the greatest pianists of all time I have another piece
that Id like to play for you Its called Abegg Variations
by Robert Schumann a German thcentury composer The name Abegg is actually ABEGG and thats the main theme in the melody Plays the notes A B E G and G That comes from the last name
of one of Schumanns female friends But he wrote that for his wife So actually if you listen carefully there are supposed to be
five variations on this Abegg theme Its written around  so even though its old
I hope youll like it Music Music ends Now comes the part that I hate Well because Mr Anderson told me that this session is called
Sync and Flow I was wondering What do I know
that these geniuses dont So Ill talk about musical composition even though I dont know where to start How do I compose I think Yamaha does a really good job
of teaching us how to compose What I do first is I make a lot
of little musical ideas you can just improvise
here at the piano  and I choose one of those
to become my main theme my main melody like the Abegg that you just heard And once I choose my main theme
I have to decide Out of all the styles in music
what kind of style do I want And this year
I composed a Romantic style So for inspiration
I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers Next I make the structure
of the entire piece with my teachers They help me plan out the whole piece And then the hard part
is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think And then when the piece
takes somewhat of a solified form  solidified excuse me  solidified form youre supposed to actually
polish the piece polish the details and then polish the overall
performance of the composition And another thing
that I enjoy doing is drawing Drawing because I like to draw
you know Japanese anime art I think thats a craze
among teens right now And once I realized it theres a parallel between creating
music and creating art because for your motive or your
little initial idea for your drawing its your character  you want
to decide who you want to draw or if you want to draw
an original character And then you want to decide
How are you going to draw the character Like am I going to use one page
Am I going to draw it on the computer Am I going to use a twopage spread
like a comic book For a more grandiose effect I guess And then you have to do
the initial sketch of the character which is like your structure of a piece and then you add pen and pencil
and whatever details that you need  thats polishing the drawing And another thing that both of these
have in common is your state of mind because I know Im one of those teenagers
that are really easily distracted So if Im trying to do homework
and I dont feel like it Ill try to draw or
you know waste my time And then what happens is
sometimes I absolutely cant draw or I cant compose at all and then its like
theres too much on your mind You cant focus
on what youre supposed to do And sometimes if you manage to use
your time wisely and work on it youll get something out of it
but it doesnt come naturally What happens is
if something magical happens if something natural happens to you youre able to produce
all this beautiful stuff instantly and then thats what I consider flow because thats when everything clicks
and youre able to do anything You feel like youre on top of your game
and you can do anything you want Im not going to play
my own composition today because although I did finish it
its way too long Instead Id like to try something
called improvisation I have here seven note cards one with each note
of the musical alphabet And Id like someone to come up here
and choose five  anyone to come up here and choose five  and then I can make it
into some sort of melody and Ill improvise it Wow A volunteer yay Jennifer Lin Nice to meet you Goldie Hawn Thank you Choose five JL Yes five cards Any five cards GH OK one
JL OK GH Two
JL Yes GH Three GH Oh D and F  too familiar JL One more
GH OK E for effort JL Would you mind reading them out
in the order that you chose them GH OK  C G B A and E JL Thank you very much GH Youre welcome And what about these JL I wont use them Thank you Now she chose C G B A E Im going to try to put that
in some sort of order Plays notes OK thats nice So Im going to have a moment to think and Ill try to make something out of it Plays the five notes Music Music ends The next song or the encore
that Im going to play is called Bumble Boogie by Jack Fina Music Music ends ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

47,"Weve been told to go out on a limb
and say something surprising So Ill try and do that but I want to start with two things
that everyone already knows And the first one in fact
is something that has been known for most of recorded history and that is that the planet Earth
or the solar system or our environment or whatever is uniquely suited
to sustain our evolution  or creation as it used to be thought  and our present existence
and most important our future survival Nowadays this idea
has a dramatic name Spaceship Earth And the idea there
is that outside the spaceship the universe is implacably hostile and inside is all we have
all we depend on and we only get the one chance
if we mess up our spaceship weve got nowhere else to go Now the second thing
that everyone already knows is that contrary to what was believed
for most of human history human beings are not in fact
the hub of existence As Stephen Hawking famously said were just a chemical scum
on the surface of a typical planet thats in orbit around a typical star which is on the outskirts
of a typical galaxy and so on Now the first of those two things
that everyone knows is kind of saying that were at a very untypical place
uniquely suited and so on and the second one is saying
that were at a typical place And especially if you regard
these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions then they seem a little bit
to conflict with each other But that doesnt prevent them
from both being completely false And they are So let me start with the second one Typical Well is this a typical place Well lets look around you know
look in a random direction and we see a wall and chemical scum  and thats not typical
of the universe at all All youve got to do is go
a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back and you wont see any walls
or chemical scum at all  all you see is a blue planet And if you go further than that youll see the Sun the solar system
and the stars and so on but thats still not typical
of the universe because stars come in galaxies And most places in the universe
a typical place in the universe is nowhere near any galaxies So lets go out further till were
outside the galaxy and look back and yeah theres the huge galaxy
with spiral arms laid out in front of us And at this point weve come
 lightyears from here But were still nowhere near
a typical place in the universe To get to a typical place youve got to go
 times as far as that into intergalactic space And so what does that
look like  typical What does a typical place
in the universe look like Well at enormous expense
TED has arranged a highresolution immersion
virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space Can we have the lights off
please so we can see it Well not quite not quite perfect You see intergalactic space
is completely dark pitch dark Its so dark that if you were to be looking
at the nearest star to you and that star were to explode
as a supernova and you were to be staring directly at it
at the moment when its light reached you you still wouldnt be able
to see even a glimmer Thats how big and how dark
the universe is And thats despite the fact
that a supernova is so bright so brilliant an event that it would kill you stone dead
at a range of several lightyears And yet from intergalactic space its so far away you wouldnt even see it Its also very cold out there  less than three degrees
above absolute zero And its very empty The vacuum there is one million times
less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth
can currently create So thats how different
a typical place is from this place And that is how untypical this place is So can we have the lights
back on please Thank you Now how do we know about an environment
thats so far away and so different and so alien from anything were used to Well the Earth  our environment
in the form of us  is creating knowledge Well what does that mean Well look out even further
than weve just been  I mean from here with a telescope  and youll see things that look
like stars theyre called quasars Quasars originally meant
quasistellar object which means things that look
a bit like stars But theyre not stars And we know what they are Billions of years ago
and billions of lightyears away the material at the center
of a galaxy collapsed towards a supermassive black hole And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy
of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of 
I think its a trillion  suns Now the physics of the human brain
could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet We couldnt survive for an instant in it Language breaks down
when trying to describe what it would be like
in one of those jets It would be a bit like experiencing
a supernova explosion but at pointblank range
and for millions of years at a time And yet that jet happened
in precisely such a way that billions of years later
on the other side of the universe some bit of chemical scum
could accurately describe and model and predict
and explain above all  theres your reference  what was happening there in reality The one physical system the brain
contains an accurate working model of the other the quasar Not just a superficial image of it
though it contains that as well but an explanatory model embodying the same
mathematical relationships and the same causal structure Now that is knowledge And if that werent amazing enough the faithfulness with which
the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time That is the growth of knowledge So the laws of physics
have this special property that physical objects as unlike each other
as they could possibly be can nevertheless embody the same
mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time So we are a chemical scum
that is different This chemical scum has universality Its structure contains
with everincreasing precision the structure of everything This place and not other places
in the universe is a hub which contains within itself
the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest
of physical reality And so far from being insignificant the fact that the laws
of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things
about the physical world Now how does the solar system 
our environment in the form of us  acquire this special relationship
with the rest of the universe Well one thing thats true
about Stephen Hawkings remark  I mean it is true
but its the wrong emphasis One thing thats true about it is that
it doesnt do it with any special physics theres no special dispensation
no miracles involved It does it simply with three things
that we have here in abundance One of them is matter because the growth of knowledge
is a form of information processing Information processing is computation
computation requires a computer  theres no known way of making
a computer without matter We also need energy to make
the computer and most important to make the media in effect
onto which we record the knowledge that we discover And then thirdly
less tangible but just as essential for the openended creation
of knowledge of explanations is evidence Now our environment
is inundated with evidence We happen to get round to testing
lets say Newtons Law of Gravity about  years ago But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every
square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that and will continue to fall
for billions of years afterwards And the same is true
for all the other sciences As far as we know evidence to discover
the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just
for the taking on our planet Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy Out in intergalactic space those three prerequisites
for the openended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply  as I said its empty its cold
and its dark out there Or is it Now actually thats just
another parochial misconception Because imagine a cube out there
in intergalactic space the same size as our home
the solar system Now that cube is very empty
by human standards but that still means that it contains
over a million tons of matter And a million tons is enough to make
say a selfcontained space station on which theres a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an openended
stream of knowledge and so on Now its way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen
from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on But the thing is
in a comprehensible universe if something isnt forbidden
by the laws of physics then what could possibly prevent us
from doing it other than knowing how In other words its a matter
of knowledge not resources If we could do that wed automatically
have an energy supply because this transmutation
would be a fusion reactor And evidence Well again its dark out there
to human senses but all youve got to do
is take a telescope even one of presentday design look out and youll see
the same galaxies as we do from here And with a more powerful telescope youll be able to see stars
and planets in those galaxies youll be able to do astrophysics
and learn the laws of physics And locally there you could build
particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics
and chemistry and so on Probably the hardest science to do
would be biology field trips  because it would take
several hundred million years to get to the nearest
lifebearing planet and back But I have to tell you 
and sorry Richard  but I never did like biology
field trips much and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years So in fact intergalactic space
does contain all the prerequisites for the openended creation of knowledge Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind
of hub that we are if the knowledge of how to do so
were present there So were not in a uniquely
hospitable place If intergalactic space
is capable of creating an openended stream of explanations then so is almost every other environment so is the Earth So is a polluted Earth And the limiting factor there and here is not resources
because theyre plentiful but knowledge which is scarce Now this cosmic knowledgebased view
may  and I think ought to  make us feel very special But it should also
make us feel vulnerable because it means that
without the specific knowledge thats needed to survive
the ongoing challenges of the universe we wont survive them All it takes is for a supernova
to go off a few lightyears away and well all be dead Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability
to all sorts of things from astrophysics to scientific
experiments gone wrong and most importantly to terrorism
with weapons of mass destruction And he thinks that civilization
has only a  percent chance of surviving this century I think hes going to talk
about that later in the conference Now I dont think that probability
is the right category to discuss this issue in but I do agree with him about this We can survive and we can fail to survive But it depends not on chance but on whether we create
the relevant knowledge in time The danger is not at all unprecedented Species go extinct all the time Civilizations end The overwhelming majority
of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history And if we want to be
the exception to that then logically our only hope
is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species
and civilization from all the others  namely our special relationship
with the laws of physics our ability to create
new explanations new knowledge  to be a hub of existence So let me now apply this
to a current controversy not because I want to advocate
any particular solution but just to illustrate
the kind of thing I mean And the controversy is global warming Now Im a physicist
but Im not the right kind of physicist In regard to global warming
Im just a layman And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously
the prevailing scientific theory And according to that theory
its already too late to avoid a disaster because if its true that our best option
at the moment is to prevent CO emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol with its constraints on economic activity
and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars
or whatever it is then that is already a disaster
by any reasonable measure And the actions that are advocated are not
even purported to solve the problem merely to postpone it by a little So its already too late to avoid it and it probably has been
too late to avoid it ever since before anyone
realized the danger It was probably already
too late in the s when the best available
scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were
about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die Now the lesson of that seems clear to me and I dont know why it isnt
informing public debate It is that we cant always know When we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less
than the cost of the disaster itself then theres not going to be
much argument really But no precautions
and no precautionary principle can avoid problems
that we do not yet foresee Hence we need a stance of problemfixing not just problemavoidance And its true that an ounce of prevention
equals a pound of cure but thats only if we know
what to prevent If youve been punched on the nose then the science of medicine
does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches If medical science stopped seeking cures
and concentrated on prevention only then it would achieve
very little of either The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions
in gas emissions at all costs It ought to be buzzing with plans
to reduce the temperature and with plans to live
at the higher temperature  and not at all costs
but efficiently and cheaply And some such plans exist things like swarms of mirrors in space
to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms
to eat more carbon dioxide At the moment these things
are fringe research theyre not central to the human effort
to face this problem or problems in general And with problems
that we are not aware of yet the ability to put right  not the sheer
good luck of avoiding indefinitely  is our only hope not just
of solving problems but of survival So take two stone tablets
and carve on them On one of them carve
Problems are soluble And on the other one carve
Problems are inevitable Thank you ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

48,So anyway who am I I usually say to people when they say What do you do I say I do hardware because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event to which he replied How quaint And I sort of really was dumbstruck And I really should have said something smart And now Ive had a little bit of time to think about it I would have said Well you know if we look at the next  years and weve seen all these problems in the last few days most of the big issues  clean water clean energy  and theyre interchangeable in some respects  and cleaner more functional materials  they all look to me to be hardware problems This doesnt mean we should ignore software or information or computation And thats in fact probably what Im going to try and tell you about So this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that were going to make things in the future Now TED sends you a lot of spam if youre a speaker about do this do that and you fill out all these forms and you dont actually know how theyre going to describe you and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist And Ive always been nervous about the term futurist because you seem doomed to failure because you cant really predict it And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have and said You know well if I have to talk about the future what is it And George Homsey a great guy said Oh the future is amazing It is so much stranger than you think Were going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut and were going to make your poo smell like peppermint So you may think thats sort of really crazy but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible So this isnt my work but its work of good friends of mine at MIT This is called the registry of standard biological parts This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very very bright individuals Basically what theyre doing is looking at biology as a programmable system Literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program Now this is actually becoming such an interesting idea This is a state diagram Thats an extremely simple computer This one is a twobit counter So thats essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology And from the results of the same competition last year a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do ifthenfor statements in materials in structure This is a pretty interesting trend because we used to live in a world where everyones said glibly Form follows function but I think Ive sort of grown up in a world  you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday I was in a lab associated with his  where its really a world where information defines form and function I spent six years thinking about that but to show you the power of art over science  this is actually one of the cartoons I write These are called HowToons I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta Took me six years at MIT and about that many pages to describe what I was doing and it took him one page And so this is our muse Tucker Hes an interesting little kid  and his sister Celine  and what hes doing here is observing the selfassembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl And in fact you can program the selfassembly of things so he starts chocolatedipping edges changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity In theory if you program those sufficiently you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure In this case hes done selfreplication of a complex D structure And thats what I thought about for a long time because this is how we currently make things This is a silicon wafer and essentially thats just a whole bunch of layers of twodimensional stuff sort of layered up The feature side is  you know people will say unclear down around about  nanometers now On the right thats a radiolara Thats a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans And that has feature sizes down to about  nanometers and its a complex D structure We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way The secret to biology is it builds computation into the way it makes things So this little thing here polymerase is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins I thought about this in the sense that its great to build in biological materials but can we do similar things Can we get selfreplicatingtype behavior Can we get complex D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems like higher speed semiconductors etc So this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously selfreplicating system And this is sort of Babbages revenge These are little mechanical computers These are fivestate state machines So thats about three light switches lined up In a neutral state they wont bind at all Now if I make a string of these a bit string they will be able to replicate So we start with white blue blue white That encodes that will now copy From one comes two and then from two comes three And so youve got this sort of replicating system It was work actually by Lionel Penrose father of Roger Penrose the tiles guy He did a lot of this work in the s and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution but its now coming back So now Im going to show you the handsfree autonomous selfreplication So weve tracked in the video the input string which was green green yellow yellow green We set them off on this air hockey table You know high science uses air hockey tables   and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy but what youre actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here So weve got autonomous replication of bit strings So why would you want to replicate bit strings Well it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme that you can take a linear string which is a convenient thing to copy and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex D structure So I was trying to you know take the engineers version Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing So what Im showing you here is that we can make a D shape  the B  assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design was that you dont need digital logic to do computation And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process So Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday I believe but Ill show you again This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles Each different color has a different magnetic polarity and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out Now hopefully those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary D structure and in fact you know I can now take a dog carve it up and then reassemble it so its a linear string that will fold from a sequence And now I can actually define that threedimensional object as a sequence of bits So you know its a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently And the universe is now a compiler And so Im thinking about you know what are the programs for programming the physical universe And how do we think about materials and structure sort of as an information and computation problem Not just where you attach a microcontroller to the end point but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic are the computers Having totally absorbed this philosophy I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently With the universe as a computer you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations You set a couple of boundary conditions like gravity the surface tension density etc and then you press execute and magically the universe produces you a perfect ball lens So this actually applied to the problem of  so theres a half a billion to a billion people in the world dont have access to cheap eyeglasses So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition If its circular you make a spherical lens If its elliptical you can make an astigmatic lens You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure  so thats part of the extra program And literally with only those two inputs  so the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure  you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error from minus  to plus eight diopters up to four diopters of cylinder And then literally you now pour on a monomer You know Ill do a Julia Childs here This is three minutes of UV light And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once youve cooked it Pop it out Ive seen this video but I still dont know if its going to end right So you reverse this This is a very old movie so with the new prototypes actually both surfaces are flexible but this will show you the point Now youve finished the lens you literally pop it out Thats next years Yves Klein you know eyeglasses shape And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters And as I rotate it against this side shot youll see that that has cylinder and that was programmed in  literally into the physics of the system So this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things like this This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment called electronic rope So literally you think about a rope It has very complex structure in the weave And under no load its one structure Under a different load its a different structure And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope Just by thinking about the physics of the world materials as the computer you can start to do things like this Im going to segue a little here I guess Im just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this One thing Im really interested about this right now is how if youre really taking this view of the universe as a computer how do we make things in a very general sense and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems share the information and work on those things together So a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time and unless Lisa Randall changes that well continue to move in linear time So that means anything you do or anything you make you produce a sequence of steps  and I think Lego in the s nailed this and they did it most elegantly But they can show you how to build things in sequence So Im thinking about how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things so you end up with this sort of guy right And I think this applies across a very broad  sort of a lot of concepts You know Cameron Sinclair yesterday said How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity And if youve seen Amy Smith she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each others source code for structure I dont know exactly how to do this yet but you know its something being actively thought about So you know that leads to questions like is this a compiler Is this a subroutine Interesting things like that Maybe Im getting a little too abstract but you know this is the sort of  returning to our comic characters  this is sort of the universe or a different universe view that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future  from biotech to materials assembly It was great to hear Bill Joy Theyre starting to invest in materials science but these are the new things in materials science How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas and see the world in a different way And its not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe  its sort of an analog computer But its definitely an interesting new worldview Ive gone too far So that sounds like its it Ive probably got a couple of minutes of questions or I can show  I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction so I may have to explain that So maybe Ill do that with this short video So this is actually a squarefoot kite which also happens to be a minimal energy surface So returning to the droplet again thinking about the universe in a new way This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp And why do you want a squarefoot kite So thats a kite the size of your house And so you want that to tow boats very fast So Ive been working on this a little also with a couple of other guys But you know this is another way to look at the  if you abstract again this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe You could just hang it as a bed sheet but again the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that So thats sort of another interesting aspect of the future

49,"Im going to present
three projects in rapid fire I dont have much time to do it And I want to reinforce three ideas
with that rapidfire presentation The first is what I like to call
a hyperrational process Its a process that takes rationality
almost to an absurd level and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes
with what people would call sort of a rational
conclusion to something And it concludes in something
that you see here that you actually wouldnt expect
as being the result of rationality The second  the second is that this process
does not have a signature There is no authorship Architects are obsessed with authorship This is something that has
editing and it has teams but in fact we no longer
see within this process the traditional master architect creating a sketch
that his minions carry out And the third is that it challenges  and this is in the length of this
very hard to support why connect all these things  but it challenges the high modernist
notion of flexibility High modernists said we will create
sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them I call it sort of shotgun flexibility  turn your head this way shoot
and youre bound to kill something So this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually
any kind of activity can happen But as were seeing operational costs are starting
to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters And so with this sort of idea what happens is whatever actually
is in the building on opening day or whatever seems to be
the most immediate need starts to dwarf the possibility
and sort of subsume it of anything else could ever happen And so were proposing
a different kind of flexibility something that we call
compartmentalized flexibility And the idea is that you
within that continuum identify a series of points
and you design specifically to them They can be pushed
offcenter a little bit but in the end you actually
still get as much of that original spectrum
as you originally had hoped With high modernist flexibility
that doesnt really work Now Im going to talk about  Im going to build up
the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes
in about five or six diagrams and I truly mean this is the design
process that youll see With the library staff
and the library board we settled on two core positions This is the first one and this
is showing over the last  years the evolution of the book
and other technologies This diagram was our sort
of position piece about the book and our position was
books are technology  thats something people forget  but its a form of technology
that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent
technology or media The second premise  and this was something
that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first  is that libraries since the inception
of Carnegie Library tradition in America had a second responsibility
and that was for social roles Ok now this Ill come back
to later but something  actually the librarians at first said
No this isnt our mandate Our mandate is media
and particularly the book So what youre seeing now
is actually the design of the building The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries
that used high modernist flexibility Sort of any activity
could happen anywhere We dont know the future of the library
we dont know the future of the book and so well use this approach And what we saw were buildings
that were very generic and worse  not only were they very generic  so not only does the reading room
look like the copy room look like the magazine area  but it meant that whatever issue
was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other
activity that was happening in it And in this case
what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities
by the expansion of the book And so we proposed
whats at the lower diagram Very dumb approach
simply compartmentalize Put those things whose evolution
we could predict  and I dont mean that we could say
what would actually happen in the future but we have some certainty of the spectrum
of what would happen in the future  put those in boxes designed
specifically for it and put the things that we cant
predict on the rooftops So that was the core idea Now we had to convince the library that social roles were
equally important to media in order to get them to accept this What youre seeing here is actually
their program on the left Thats as it was given to us
in all of its clarity and glory Our first operation was to redigest it
back to them show it to them and say You know what We havent touched it but only onethird of your own program
is dedicated to media and books Twothirds of it is already dedicated  thats the white band below
the thing you said isnt important  is already dedicated to social functions So once we had presented
that back to them they agreed that this sort
of core concept could work We got the right to go back
to first principles  thats the third diagram We recombined everything And then we started making new decisions What youre seeing on the right
is the design of the library specifically in terms of square footage On the left of that diagram here
youll see a series of five platforms  sort of combs collective programs And on the right are the more
indeterminate spaces things like reading rooms whose evolution in    years
we cant predict So that literally was the design
of the building They signed it and to their chagrin we came back a week later
and we presented them this And as you can see it is literally
the diagram on the right We just sized  no really
I mean that literally The things on the lefthand side
of the diagram those are the boxes We sized them into five compartments
Theyre superefficient We had a very low budget to work with We pushed them around on the site to make very literal
contextual relationships The reading room
should be able to see the water The main entrance should have
a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code and so forth So you see the five platforms
those are the boxes within each one a very discrete
thing is happening The area in between
is sort of an urban continuum these things that we cant predict
their evolution to the same degree To give you some sense
of the power of this idea the biggest block
is what we call the book spiral Its literally built
in a very inexpensive way  it is a parking garage for books It just so happens to be on the th
through th floors of the building but that is not necessarily
an expensive approach And it allows us to organize
the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run no matter how it
grows or contracts within the building it will always have its clarity
to end the sort of trail of tears that weve all experienced
in public libraries And so this was the final operation which was to take these blocks
as they were all pushed off kilter and to hold onto them with a skin That skin serves double duty
again for economics One it is the lateral stability
for the entire building its a structural element But its dimensions were designed
not only for structure but also for holding on
every piece of glass The glass was then 
Ill use the word impregnated  but it had a layer of metal
that was called stretched metal That metal acts as a microlouver so from the exterior of the building
the sun sees it as totally opaque but from the interior
its entirely transparent So now Im going to take you
on a tour of the building Let me see if I can find it For anyone who gets
motion sickness I apologize So this is the building And I think whats important is
when we first unveiled the building the public saw it as being
totally about our whim and ego And it was defended
believe it or not by the librarians They said Look
we dont know what it is but we know its everything
that we need it to be based on the observations
that weve done about the program This is going into one of the entries So its an unusual building
for a public library obviously So now were going
into what we call the living room This is actually a program
that we invented with the library It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space There are plenty of shopping malls
that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain So this was an unprogrammed area where
people could pretty much do anything including eat yell
play chess and so forth Now were moving up into what we call
the mixing chamber That was the main
technology area in the building Youll have to tell me
if Im going too fast for you And now up This is actually the place
that we put into the building so I could propose
to my wife right there She said yes Im running out of time
so Im actually going to stop I can show this to you later But lets see if I can very quickly
get into the book spiral because I think its
as I said the most  this is the main reading room 
the most unique part of the building You dizzy yet Ok so here this is the book spiral So its very indiscernible but its actually
a continuous stairstepping It allows you to on one city block go up one full floor
so that its on a continuum Ok now Im going to go back
and Im going to hit a second project Im going to go very
very quickly through this Now this is the Dallas Theater It was an unusual client for us
because they came to us and they said We need you to do a new building Weve been working
in a temporary space for  years but because of that temporary space weve become an infamous theater company Theater is really focused in New York
Chicago and Seattle with the exception
of the Dallas Theater Company And the very fact that they worked
in a provisional space meant that for Beckett
they could blow out a wall they could do Cherry Orchard and blow
a hole through the floor and so forth So it was a very daunting task
for us to do a brandnew building that could be a pristine building but keep this kind of experimental nature And the second is they were what we call
a multiform theater they do different kinds
of performances in repertory So they in the morning
will do something in arena then theyll do something
in proscenium and so forth And so they needed to be able
to quickly transform between different theater organizations and for operational budget reasons this actually no longer
happens in pretty much any multiform theater
in the United States so we needed to figure out
a way to overcome that So our thought was to literally
put the theater on its head to take those things
that were previously defined as frontofhouse and backofhouse and stack them above house
and below house and to create what we called
a theater machine We invest the money
in the operation of the building Its almost as though the building
could be placed anywhere wherever you place it the area under it is charged
for theatrical performances And it allowed us to go back
to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic
enclosure light enclosure and so forth And at the push of a button it allows the artistic director
to move between proscenium thrust and in fact arena
and traverse and flat floor in a very quick transfiguration So in fact using
operational budget we can  sorry capital cost 
we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable
in operational cost And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she
can choose from between a series of forms
and a series of processions because that enclosure around the theater
that is normally trapped with frontofhouse and backofhouse
spaces has been liberated So an artistic director has the ability
to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession shows the first act in thrust the intermission in a Greek procession second act in arena and so forth So Im going to show you
what this actually means This is the theater up close Any portion around the theater
actually can be opened discretely The light enclosure can be lifted
separate to the acoustic enclosure so you can do Beckett
with Dallas as the backdrop Portions can be opened so you can now actually have motorcycles
drive directly into the performance or you can even just have
an openair performance or for intermissions The balconies all move to go
between those configurations but they also disappear The proscenium line can also disappear You can bring enormous objects in so in fact the Dallas Theater Company  their first show will be a play
about Charles Lindbergh and theyll want to bring in
a real aircraft And then it also provides them
in the offseason the ability to actually rent out
their space for entirely different things This is it from a distance Open up entire portions
for different kinds of events And at night Again remove the light enclosure
keep the acoustic enclosure This is a monster truck show Im going to show now the last project This also is an unusual client They inverted the whole idea
of development They came to us and they said 
unlike normal developers  they said We want to start out by providing a contemporary
art museum in Louisville Thats our main goal And so instead of being a developer
that sees an opportunity to make money they saw an ability to be
a catalyst in their downtown And the fact that they wanted to support
the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma so they worked in reverse And that pro forma led us to a mixeduse building
that was very large in order to support
their aspirations of the art but it also opened up opportunities
for the art itself to collaborate interact
with commercial spaces that actually artists more
and more want to work within And it also charged us
with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of subbuilding So this is Louisvilles skyline and Im going to take
you through the various constraints that led to the project First the physical constraints We actually had to operate
on three discrete sites all of them well smaller
than the size of the building We had to operate next to the new
Muhammad Ali Center and respect it We had to operate
within the year floodplain Now this area floods
three to four times a year and theres a levee behind our site similar to the ones
that broke in New Orleans Had to operate behind the I corridor a street that cuts through the middle
of these separate sites So were starting to build a sort of
nightmare of constraints in a bathtub Underneath the bathtub
are the citys main power lines And there is a pedestrian corridor
that they wanted to add that would link a series
of cultural buildings and a view corridor 
because this is the historic district  that they didnt want to obstruct
with a new building And now were going to add
 million square feet And if we did the traditional thing
that  million square feet  these are the different programs  the traditional thing would be to identify
the public elements place them on sites and now wed have a really
terrible situation a public thing in the middle
of a bathtub that floods And then we would size
all the other elements  the different commercial elements hotel luxury housing
offices and so forth  and dump it on top And we would create
something that was unviable In fact  and you know this  this
is called the Time Warner Building So our strategy was very simple Just lift the entire block flip some of the elements over reposition them
so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown and make circulation connections
and reroute the road So thats the basic concept and now Im going to show you
what it leads to Ok it seems a very formal
willful gesture but something derived entirely
out of the constraints And again when we unveiled it
there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect
making a statement not an architect who was attempting
to solve a series of problems Now within that center zone as I said we have the ability to mix
a series of things So here this is sort of an xray  the towers are totally developerdriven They told us the dimensions
the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking
all the public components  the lobbies the bars  everything that different commercial
elements would have and combined it in the center
in the sort of subway map in the transfer zone that would also
include the contemporary art museum So it creates a situation like this
where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has
an amazing view on the nd floor but it also has proximity that the curator
can either open or close It allows people
on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art and so forth It also means that if an artist wants
to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition
in a swimming pool so theyre not forced to always
work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space So how to build this Its very simple its a chair So we begin by building the cores As were building the cores we build
the contemporary art museum at grade That allows us to have
incredible efficiency and cost efficiency This is not a highbudget building The moment the cores get to mid level we finish the art museum we put
all the mechanical equipment in it and then we jack it up into the air This is how they build
really large aircraft hangars for instance the ones
that they did for the A Finish the cores finish the meat and you get something
that looks like this Now I only have about  seconds so I want to start an animation and well conclude with that Thank you Chris asked me to add  the theater is under construction and this project will start
construction in about a year and finish in  identify public elements insert public elements at grade optimize tower dimensions place towers on site lift program flip optimize program adjacencies connect to context redirect th street ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50,About  years ago I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong And at the time I was very superstitious So upon landing  this was still at the old Hong Kong airport thats Kai Tak when it was smack in the middle of the city  I thought If I see something good Im going to have a great time here in my two weeks And if I see something negative Im going to be miserable indeed So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there And it turned out that  I just went to see you know what they are doing in Hong Kong But I actually walked away with a great job offer And I flew back to Austria packed my bags and another week later I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking Well if that Winner billboard is still up Im going to have a good time working here But if its gone its going to be really miserable and stressful So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it On the other hand it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong However I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life  of you know I think what the conference brochure refers to as moments that take your breath away And since Im a big list maker I actually listed them all Now you dont have to go through the trouble of reading them and I wont read them for you I know that its incredibly boring to hear about other peoples happinesses What I did do though is I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design And very surprisingly over half of them had actually something to do with design So there are of course two different possibilities Theres one from a consumers point of view  where I was happy while experiencing design And Ill just give you one example I had gotten my first Walkman This is  My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely And The Polices Synchronicity cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman And I remember it as a true moment of happiness You know of course they are related to this combination of at least two of them being you know design objects And you know theres a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know situated somewhere here  right in there between Delight and Bliss Now there is the other part from a designers standpoint  if youre happy while actually doing it And one way to see how happy designers are when theyre designing could be to look at the authors photos on the back of their monographs So according to this the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy While somewhat the Spaniards  and I think particularly the Swiss Laughter dont seem to be doing all that well Last November a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum in a skyscraper up on the th floor And their inaugural exhibit was called Happiness And I went very eagerly to see it because  well also with an eye on this conference And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas Under Arcadia they showed things like this from the Edo period  a hundred ways to write happiness in different forms Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono  that of course later on was you know made into the label for The Beatles Under Nirvana they showed this Constable painting And there was a little  an interesting theory about abstraction This is a blue field  its actually an Yves Klein painting And the theory was that if you abstract an image you really you know open as much room for the unrepresentable  and therefore you know are able to involve the viewer more Then under Desire they showed these Shunsho paintings  also from the Edo period  ink on silk And lastly under Harmony they had this thcentury mandala from Tibet Now what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness And I felt a little bit cheated because the visualization  thats a really easy thing to do And you know my studio  weve done it all the time This is you know a book A happy dog  and you take it out its an aggressive dog Its a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face You know thats not a big deal to accomplish It has gotten to the point where you know within advertising or within the movie industry happy has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic you almost would have to you know do it from a cynical point of view This is you know the movie poster Or we a couple of weeks ago designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has very much a dark side to it Much much more difficult is this where the designs actually can evoke happiness  and Im going to just show you three that actually did this for me This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York who calls himself True Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs True printed his own version of these signs Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with  of his friends They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version So this is one Now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs So youre youre really bored in the subway and you kind of stare at something And it takes you a while until it actually  you realize that this says something different than what it normally says I mean thats at least how it made me happy Now True is a real humanitarian He didnt want any of his friends to be arrested so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody  sort of like pretending that its an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority Another New York project This is at PS   a sculpture thats basically a square room by James Turrell that has a retractable ceiling Opens up at dusk and dawn every day You dont see the horizon Youre just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky And the room is truly something to be seen Peoples demeanor changes when they go in there And for sure I havent looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there There are of course more than those three projects that Im showing here I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz Cloud a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy as well But my last project is again from a young designer in New York Hes from Korea originally And he took it upon himself to print  speech bubbles  empty speech bubbles stickers large ones and small ones And he goes around New York and just puts them empty as they are on posters And other people go and fill them in This one says Please let me die in peace I think that was  the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good This is on a musician poster that says I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than  units and that as a result my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me after which my contract will be cancelled and Ill be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins Jee gets to have his project the public gets a sweeter environment and different public gets a place to express itself and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads Well there was a question of course that was on my mind for a while You know can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I dont like to be doing Which brought me back to my list making  you know just to see what I actually like about my job You know one is just working without pressure Then working concentrated without being frazzled Or as Nancy said before like really immerse oneself into it Try not to get stuck doing the same thing  or try not get stuck behind the computer all day This is you know related to it getting out of the studio Then of course trying to you know work on things where the content is actually important for me And being able to enjoy the end results And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far And just about at that time an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads  design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine And the whole thing just fell together So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned  in this case Everything I do always comes back to me  and we made these spreads right out of this So it was Everything I do always comes back to me A couple of weeks ago a French company asked us to design five billboards for them Again we could supply the content for it So I just picked another one And this was two weeks ago We flew to Arizona  the designer who works with me and myself  and photographed this one So its Trying to look good limits my life And then we did one more of these This is again for a magazine dividing pages This is Having  this is the same thing its just you know photographed from the side This is from the front Then its guts Again its the same thing  guts is just the same room reworked Then its always works out Then its for with the light on And its me Thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51,The old story about climate protection is that its costly or it would have been done already So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it The new story about climate protection is that its not costly but profitable This was a simple sign error because its cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel as is well known to companies that do it all the time  for example Dupont SD micro electronics Many other firms  IBM  are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants and they get their money back in two or three years Thats called a profit Now similarly the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it it would be expensive or we would have done it already because markets are essentially perfect If of course that were true there would be no innovation and nobody could make any money But the new story about oil is the government doesnt have to force us to do painful things to get off oil  not just incrementally but completely  quite the contrary The United States for example can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time led by business for profit because its so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict particularly over oil This thesis is set out in a book called Winning the Oil Endgame that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgamecom  about  downloads so far And it was cosponsored by the Pentagon  its independent its peerreviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal Now a bit of economic history I think may be helpful here Around  one of the biggest US industries was whaling And whale oil lit practically every building But in the nine years before Drake struck oil in  at least fivesixths of that whale oililluminating market disappeared thanks to fatal competitors chiefly oil and gas made from coal to which the whalers had not been paying attention So very unexpectedly they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profitmaximizing capitalists And its funny  it feels a bit like this now for oil Weve been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil and no one had bothered to add them up before So when we did we found some very surprising things Now there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk On the competitiveness front we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together And serious competition from Europe from Korea and next is China which will soon be a major net exporter of cars How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wallybadged Shanghai automotive superefficient car Maybe a decade according to my friends in Detroit China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leapfrog technology Theyre not going to export your uncles Buick And after that comes India The point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient The question is who will make them Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars That seems to make more sense The more we keep on using the oil particularly the imported oil the more we face a very obvious array of problems Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing but nothing is not the right number It could well be enough to double the oil price for example And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that dont have oil And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Faroffistan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens They dont like fighting over oil they dont like being in the sands and they dont like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates Now in order to avoid these problems whatever you think theyre worth its actually not that complicated We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently at a cost of  dollars per saved barrel And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced biofuels and safe natural gas And that costs on average under  dollars a barrel And compared with the official forecast that oil will cost  dollars a barrel in  which is half of what weve been paying lately that will save  billion dollars a year starting quite soon Now in order to do this we need to invest about  billion dollars half of it to retool the car truck and plane industries half of it to build the advanced biofuel industry In the process we will gain about a million good jobs mainly rural And protect another million jobs now at risk mainly in automaking And well also get returns over  billion dollars a year So thats a very handsome return Its financeable in the private capital market But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned to happen sooner and with higher confidence then  and also to expand choice and manage risk  then you might like some lighthanded public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic And these policies work fine without taxes subsidies or mandates They make a little net money for the treasury They have a broad transideological appeal and because we want them actually to happen we figured out ways to do them that do not require much if any federal legislation and can indeed be done administratively or at a state level Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem namely light vehicles here are four ultralight carboncomposite concept cars with low drag and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive You can sort of have it all with these things For example this Opel twoseater does  miles an hour at  miles a gallon This muscle car from Toyota  horsepower in an ultralight that does zero to  in well under four seconds and still gets  miles a gallon Ill say more later about this And in the upper left a pioneering effort  years ago by GM   miles a gallon without even using a hybrid in a fourseater Well saving that fuel  percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about  cents per saved gallon But its even a better deal for heavy trucks where you save a similar amount at  cents a gallon with better aerodynamics and tires and engines and so on and taking out weight so you can put it into payload So you can double efficiency with a  percent internal rate of return Then you can go even further almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements double the big haulers margins And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull and flip the market In the airplane business its again a similar story where the first  percent fuel saving is free as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner But then the next generation of planes saves about half Again much cheaper than buying the fuel And if you go over the next  years or so to a blendedwing body kind of a flying wing with internal engines then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles the cars and light trucks because we all know the most about those probably everybody here drives one And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan of all the fuel energy you feed into the car seveneighths never gets to the wheels its lost first in the engine idling at zero miles a gallon the power train and accessories So then of the energy that does get to the wheels only an eighth of it half of that goes to heat the tires on the road or to heat the air the car pushes aside And only this little bit only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop In fact since  percent of the weight youre moving is the car not the driver less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort Moreover threefourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car And its obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels So theres huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that  well then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car and it would cost a lot more to make because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials For example we use a lot of carbonfiber composites in sporting goods And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety Heres a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got tboned by a Golf The Golf was totaled The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel Theyll pop it back on and fix the scratch later But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at  miles an hour the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbonfiber composite cones weighing a total of  pounds hidden in the front end Because these materials could actually absorb six to  times as much energy per pound as steel and do so a lot more smoothly And this means weve just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight We could make cars bigger which is protective but make them light Whereas if we made them heavy theyd be both hostile and inefficient And when you make them light in the right way that can be simpler and cheaper to make You can end up saving money and lives and oil all at the same time I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic uncompromised quintupledefficiency suburbanassault vehicle   and this is a complete virtual design that is productioncosted manufacturable And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff strong carboncomposite material and then ways to thermoform it because its a combination of carbon and nylon into whatever complex shapes you want like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tierone suppliers And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified Because the auto body has only say  parts instead of   Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist They snap together like a kids toy So you got rid of the body shop And if you want you can lay color in the mold and get rid of the paint shop Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car So you end up with at least twofifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry which GM has in Lansing The plant also gets smaller Now when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil including buildings industry feedstocks and so on you find that of the  million barrels a day the government says we will need in  well about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over at an average cost of only  bucks a barrel instead of  for buying the oil And then another six can be made robustly competitively from cellulosic ethanol and a little biodiesel without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production There is a huge amount of gas to be saved about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price And here are some nobrainer substitutions of it with lots left over So much in fact that after youve handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved you have only this little bit left and lets see how we can meet that because theres a pretty flexible menu of ways We could of course buy more efficiency Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at  bucks instead of  Or wait to capture the second half of it Or we could of course just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us But theyll sell it to Japan and China instead because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers and they dont Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance or if we used it as hydrogen which is more profitable and efficient wed get rid of the domestic oil too And that doesnt even count for example that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country So we have lots of options And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible Now to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence there is a few ways government could help For example feebates a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles Youre not paid to change size class You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of lifecycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three This expands choice rapidly in the market and actually makes more money for automakers as well Id like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for lowincome families to get efficient reliable warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get And for each car so financed scrap almost one clunker preferably the dirtiest ones This creates a new millioncarayear market for Detroit from customers they werent going to get otherwise because they werent creditworthy and could never afford a new car And Detroit will make money on every unit It turns out that if say AfricanAmerican and white households had the same car ownership it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities So this is a huge social win too Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster And we could even do an X Prizestyle golden carrot thats worth stretching further for For example a billiondollar prize for the first US automaker to sell  really advanced vehicles like some you saw earlier Then the legacy airlines cant afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that there are ways to finance it And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air they would waste more oil and block the uptake of efficient new planes Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive We ought to take them out back and shoot them and put bounty hunters after them Then theres an important military role That in creating the move to highvolume lowcost commercial production of these kinds of materials or for that matter ultralight steels that are a good backup technology the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet Just turn it over to the private sector and we have an Internet The same for GPS The same for the modern semiconductor industry That is military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materialsindustrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining and shift the convergence of the energy and agvalue chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates and get out of our own way in other ways And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster But heres how the whole thing fits together Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up they can turn down with the  dollars a barrel efficiency down steeply by adding the supplyside substitutions at  bucks all implemented at slower rates than weve done before when we paid attention And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the s And the one thing Id like to point out here is that weve done this before In this eightyear period  to  when we last paid attention the economy grew  percent oil use fell  percent oil imports fell  percent oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell  percent They would have been gone if wed kept that up one more year Well that was with very old technologies and delivery methods We could rerun that play a lot better now And yet what we proved then is the US has more market power than OPEC Ours is on the demand side We are the Saudi Arabia of negabarrels Laughter We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil Whatever your reason for wanting to do this whether youre concerned about national

53,"If youre here today  and Im very happy that you are  youve all heard about
how sustainable development will save us from ourselves However when were not at TED
we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda
is just not feasible especially in large urban areas
like New York City And thats because most people
with decisionmaking powers in both the public and the private sector really dont feel
as though theyre in danger The reason why Im here today
in part is because of a dog  an abandoned puppy I found
back in the rain back in  She turned out to be
a much bigger dog than Id anticipated When she came into my life we were
fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that
our small part of New York City already handled more than  percent
of the entire citys commercial waste a sewage treatment pelletizing plant
a sewage sludge plant four power plants the worlds largest
fooddistribution center as well as other industries that bring
more than  diesel truck trips to the area each week The area also has one of the lowest ratios
of parks to people in the city So when I was contacted
by the Parks Department about a  seedgrant initiative
to help develop waterfront projects I thought they were really
wellmeaning but a bit naive Id lived in this area all my life
and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities
that I mentioned earlier Then while jogging
with my dog one morning she pulled me into what I thought
was just another illegal dump There were weeds and piles of garbage
and other stuff that I wont mention here but she kept dragging me and lo and behold at the end
of that lot was the river I knew that this forgotten
little streetend abandoned like the dog that brought
me there was worth saving And I knew it would grow
to become the proud beginnings of the communityled revitalization
of the new South Bronx And just like my new dog it was an idea
that got bigger than Id imagined We garnered much support along the way and the Hunts Point Riverside Park
became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had
in more than  years We leveraged that  seed grant
more than  times into a  million park And in the fall Im going to exchange
marriage vows with my beloved Audience whistles Thank you very much Thats him pressing my buttons
back there which he does all the time But those of us living
in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine We feel the problems right now
and have for some time Environmental justice for those of you
who may not be familiar with the term goes something like this no community should be saddled
with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits
than any other Unfortunately race and class
are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff
like parks and trees and where one might find the bad stuff
like power plants and waste facilities As a black person in America
I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution
poses the greatest risk to my health I am five times more likely
to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility which I do These landuse decisions
created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity
diabetes and asthma Why would someone leave their home to go
for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood Our  percent obesity rate
is high even for this country and diabetes comes with it One out of four South Bronx
children has asthma Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher
than the national average These impacts are coming everyones way And we all pay dearly
for solid waste costs health problems associated
with pollution and more odiously the cost of imprisoning
our young black and Latino men who possess untold amounts
of untapped potential Fifty percent of our residents
live at or below the poverty line  percent of us are unemployed Lowincome citizens often use
emergencyroom visits as primary care This comes at a high cost to taxpayers
and produces no proportional benefits Poor people are not only still poor
they are still unhealthy Fortunately there are many people
like me who are striving for solutions that wont compromise the lives of lowincome communities of color
in the short term and wont destroy us all in the long term None of us want that
and we all have that in common So what else do we have in common Well first of all
were all incredibly goodlooking Graduated high school college
postgraduate degrees traveled to interesting places
didnt have kids in your early teens financially stable never been imprisoned OK Good But besides being a black woman I am different from most of you
in some other ways I watched nearly half of the buildings
in my neighborhood burn down My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam only to be gunned down
a few blocks from our home Jesus I grew up with a crack house
across the street Yeah Im a poor black child
from the ghetto These things make me different from you But the things we have in common set me apart from most
of the people in my community and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart
to fight for justice in the other So how did things get so different for us In the late s my dad 
a Pullman porter son of a slave  bought a house in the Hunts Point
section of the South Bronx and a few years later he married my mom At the time the community was a mostly
white workingclass neighborhood My dad was not alone And as others like him pursued
their own version of the American dream white flight became common
in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country Redlining was used by banks
wherein certain sections of the city including ours were deemed
offlimits to any sort of investment Many landlords believed it was more
profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather
than to sell under those conditions  dead or injured former tenants
notwithstanding Hunts Point was formerly
a walktowork community but now residents had neither
work nor home to walk to A national highway construction boom
was added to our problems In New York State Robert Moses spearheaded
an aggressive highwayexpansion campaign One of its primary goals was
to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities
in Westchester County to go to Manhattan The South Bronx which lies in between
did not stand a chance Residents were often given
less than a months notice before their buildings were razed  people were displaced The common perception was that only pimps and pushers
and prostitutes were from the South Bronx And if you are told
from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come
from your community that its bad and ugly how could it not reflect on you So now my familys property
was worthless save for that it was our home
and all we had And luckily for me that home
and the love inside of it along with help from teachers mentors
and friends along the way was enough Now why is this story important Because from a planning perspective economic degradation
begets environmental degradation which begets social degradation The disinvestment that began
in the s set the stage for all the environmental
injustices that were to come Antiquated zoning and landuse
regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting
facilities in my neighborhood Are these factors taken into consideration
when landuse policy is decided What costs are associated
with these decisions And who pays Who profits Does anything justify
what the local community goes through This was planning  in quotes  that did not have
our best interests in mind Once we realized that we decided
it was time to do our own planning That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building
a Greenway movement in the South Bronx I wrote a oneandaquartermillion
dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan
for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated onstreet bike paths Physical improvements help inform
public policy regarding traffic safety the placement of the waste
and other facilities which if done properly dont compromise
a communitys quality of life They provide opportunities
to be more physically active as well as local economic development Think bike shops juice stands We secured  million dollars
to build firstphase projects This is Lafayette Avenue  and thats redesigned
by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects And once this path is constructed
itll connect the South Bronx with more than  acres
of Randalls Island Park Right now were separated by about  feet
of water but this link will change that As we nurture the natural environment
its abundance will give us back even more We run a project called the Bronx
Environmental Stewardship Training which provides job training in the fields
of ecological restoration so that folks from our community
have the skills to compete for these wellpaying jobs Little by little were seeding
the area with greencollar jobs  and with people that have both
a financial and personal stake in their environment The Sheridan Expressway
is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era built with no regard for the neighborhoods
that were divided by it Even during rush hour
it goes virtually unused The community created
an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal
of the highway We have the opportunity now to bring
together all the stakeholders to reenvision how this  acres
can be better utilized for parkland affordable housing
and local economic development We also built New York Citys first green
and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices Cool roofs are highlyreflective
surfaces that dont absorb solar heat and pass it on to
the building or atmosphere Green roofs are soil and living plants Both can be used instead
of petroleumbased roofing materials that absorb heat contribute
to urban heat island effect and degrade under the sun which we in turn breathe Green roofs also retain
up to  percent of rainfall so they reduce a citys need to fund
costly endofpipe solutions  which incidentally are often located in environmental justice
communities like mine And they provide habitats
for our little friends Butterfly So cool Anyway the demonstration
project is a springboard for our own green roof
installation business bringing jobs and sustainable
economic activity to the South Bronx Green is the new black  Laughter Applause I like that too Anyway I know Chris told us
not to do pitches up here but since I have all of your attention We need investors End of pitch Its better to ask
for forgiveness than permission Anyway  OK Katrina Prior to Katrina the South Bronx
and New Orleans Ninth Ward had a lot in common Both were largely populated
by poor people of color both hotbeds of cultural innovation
think hiphop and jazz Both are waterfront communities
that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another In the postKatrina era
we have still more in common Were at best ignored
and maligned and abused at worst by negligent regulatory agencies
pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward
nor the South Bronx was inevitable But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out We are more than simply
national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved
by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone Now will we let the Gulf Coast
languish for a decade or two like the South Bronx did Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource
of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation
in communities like mine Now listen I do not expect individuals corporations or government
to make the world a better place because it is right or moral This presentation today only represents
some of what Ive been through Like a tiny little bit Youve no clue But Ill tell you later
if you want to know But  I know its the bottom line
or ones perception of it that motivates people in the end Im interested in what I like to call
the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce Developments that have the potential
to create positive returns for all concerned
the developers government and the community
where these projects go up At present thats not happening
in New York City And we are operating with a comprehensive
urbanplanning deficit A parade of government subsidies is going to propose bigbox and stadium
developments in the South Bronx but there is scant coordination
between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects
of increased traffic pollution solid waste and the impacts on open space And their approaches to local economic
and job development are so lame its not even funny Because on top of that the worlds richest sports team
is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two
wellloved community parks Now well have even less
than that stat I told you about earlier And although less than  percent
of South Bronx residents own cars these projects include
thousands of new parking spaces yet zip in terms of mass public transit Now whats missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive costbenefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy
environmentallychallenged community versus incorporating structural
sustainable changes My agency is working closely
with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues Now lets get this straight
I am not antidevelopment Ours is a city not a wilderness preserve And Ive embraced my inner capitalist And but I dont have  You probably all have
and if you havent you need to So I dont have a problem
with developers making money Theres enough precedent out there
to show that a sustainable communityfriendly development
can still make a fortune Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough
and Amory Lovins  both heroes of mine by the way 
have shown that you can actually do that I do have a problem
with developments that hyperexploit politically vulnerable
communities for profit That it continues is a shame upon us all because we are all responsible
for the future that we create But one of the things I do
to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries
in other cities This is my version of globalization Lets take Bogota Poor Latino surrounded by
runaway gun violence and drug trafficking a reputation not unlike
that of the South Bronx However this city was blessed
in the late s with a highlyinfluential
mayor named Enrique Pe�alosa He looked at the demographics Few Bogotanos own cars yet a huge portion of the citys resources
was dedicated to serving them If youre a mayor you can
do something about that His administration narrowed key municipal
thoroughfares from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets expanded pedestrian walkways
and bike lanes created public plazas created one of the most efficient
bus masstransit systems in the entire world For his brilliant efforts
he was nearly impeached But as people began to see
that they were being put first on issues reflecting
their daytoday lives incredible things happened People stopped littering Crime rates dropped because the streets
were alive with people His administration attacked several
typical urban problems at one time and on a thirdworld budget at that We have no excuse
in this country Im sorry But the bottom line is
their peoplefirst agenda was not meant to penalize
those who could actually afford cars but rather to provide opportunities
for all Bogotanos to participate in the citys resurgence That development should not come at the expense of the majority
of the population is still considered
a radical idea here in the US But Bogotas example
has the power to change that You however are blessed
with the gift of influence Thats why youre here and why you
value the information we exchange Use your influence in support of comprehensive
sustainable change everywhere Dont just talk about it at TED This is a nationwide policy agenda
Im trying to build and as you all know
politics are personal Help me make green the new black Help me make sustainability sexy Make it a part of your dinner
and cocktail conversations Help me fight for environmental
and economic justice Support investments
with a triplebottomline return Help me democratize sustainability
by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive
planning can be addressed everywhere Oh good glad I have a little more time Listen  when I spoke to Mr Gore
the other day after breakfast I asked him how environmental justice
activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy His response was a grant program I dont think he understood
that I wasnt asking for funding I was making him an offer What troubled me was that this
topdown approach is still around Now dont get me wrong we need money But grassroots groups
are needed at the table during the decisionmaking process Of the  percent of the energy
that Mr Gore reminded us that we waste every day dont add wasting our energy intelligence and hardearned experience to that count I have come from so far
to meet you like this Please dont waste me By working together we can become one of those small
rapidlygrowing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually
can change the world We might have come to this conference from very very different
stations in life but believe me we all share
one incredibly powerful thing We have nothing to lose
and everything to gain Ciao bellos ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

54,"Im going to take you
on a journey very quickly To explain the wish Im going
to have to take you somewhere where many people havent been
and thats around the world When I was about  years old Kate Stohr
and myself started an organization to get architects and designers
involved in humanitarian work not only about responding
to natural disasters but involved in systemic issues We believe that where the resources
and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design can really
make a difference in peoples lives So I started my life as an architect
or training as an architect and I was always interested
in socially responsible design and how you can really make an impact But when I went to architecture school it seemed that I was
a black sheep in the family Many architects seemed to think
that when you design you design a jewel and its a jewel
that you try and crave for whereas I felt that when you design you either improve
or you create a detriment to the community
in which youre designing So youre not just doing
a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it
but for the community as a whole And in  we started by responding
to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo And I didnt know what I was doing 
like I said mids  and Im the Internet generation
so we started a website We put a call out there
and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries
from around the world That led to a number
of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics
in subSaharan Africa responding to the HIVAIDS pandemic That led to  entries from  countries We also have designers
from around the world that participate And we had an exhibit
of work that followed that  was the tipping point for us We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran in Bam also following up on our work in Africa Working within the United States  most people look at poverty
and they see the face of a foreigner But I live in Bozeman Montana  go up to the north plains
on the reservations or go down to Alabama
or Mississippi preKatrina and I could have shown you
places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries
that Ive been to So we got involved in and worked
in inner cities and elsewhere and also I will go into
some more projects  Mother Nature kicked our ass I think we can pretty much assume
that  was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters And because of the Internet and because of connections
to blogs and so forth within literally hours of the tsunami
we were already raising funds getting involved working
with people on the ground We run from a couple of laptops
and in the first couple of days I had  emails
from people needing help So we began to get involved
in projects there and Ill talk about some others And then of course this year
weve been responding to Katrina as well as following up
on our reconstruction work So this is a brief overview In  I really couldnt manage
the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests
that I was getting It was all coming
into my laptop and cell phone So we decided to embrace
an opensource model of business  so that anyone anywhere in the world
could start a local chapter and they can get involved
in local problems Because I believe there
is no such thing as Utopia All problems are local
All solutions are local So that means you know
somebody whos based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do So what happened is we used Meetup
and all these other Internet tools and we ended up having
 chapters starting up thousands of architects in  countries So the bullet point 
sorry I never do a suit so I knew that I was going
to take this off OK because Im going to do it very quick This isnt just about nonprofit What it showed me is that
theres a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers
who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller
and that we have the opportunity  not the responsibility
but the opportunity  to really get involved in making change Im adding that to my time So what you dont know is weve got these thousands of designers
working around the world connected basically by a website
and we have a staff of three The fact that nobody told us
we couldnt do it we did it And so theres something
to be said about na�vet� So seven years later weve developed so that weve got advocacy
instigation and implementation We advocate for good design
not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums opeds we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation
and dealing with public policy We can talk about FEMA
but thats another talk Instigation developing ideas
with communities and NGOs doing opensource design competitions Referring matchmaking with communities And then implementing  actually
going out there and doing the work because when you invent
its never a reality until its built So its really important
that if were designing and trying to create change
we build that change So heres a select number of projects Kosovo This is Kosovo in  We did an open design
competition like I said It led to a whole variety of ideas And this wasnt about emergency shelter but transitional shelter
that would last five to  years that would be placed next to the land
the resident lived in and that they would rebuild
their own home This wasnt imposing
an architecture on a community this was giving them
the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow
the way they want to We had from the sublime
to the ridiculous but they worked This is an inflatable hemp house
It was built it works This is a shipping container Built and works And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with
architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities
through complex networks So weve engaged not just designers but also a whole variety
of technologybased professionals Using rubble from destroyed homes
to create new homes Using straw bale construction
creating heat walls And then something remarkable
happened in  We went to Africa originally
to look at the housing issue Within three days we realized
the problem was not housing it was the growing pandemic of HIVAIDS And it wasnt doctors telling us this it was actual villagers
that we were staying with And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk
  kilometers to see doctors you get the doctors to the people And we started engaging
the medical community and you know we thought
we were real bright sparks  Weve come up with this great idea mobile health clinics widely distributed
throughout subSaharan Africa And the medical community there said Weve said this for the last decade We know this We just dont know
how to show this So in a way we had taken preexisting
needs and shown solutions And so again we had a whole variety
of ideas that came in This one I personally love because the idea is that architecture
is not just about solutions but about raising awareness This is a kenaf clinic You get seed and you grow it
in a plot of land and it grows  feet in a month And on the fourth week the doctors
come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors
have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers you cut down the clinic and you eat it Its an eatyourownclinic So its dealing with the fact
that if you have AIDS you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there So you know this is a serious solution This one I love The idea is its not just a clinic
its a community center This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a selfsustaining project Every one of these projects
is sustainable Thats not because
Im a treehugging green person Its because when you live
on four dollars a day youre living on survival
and you have to be sustainable You have to know where
your energy is coming from you have to know where
your resource is coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down So this is about getting
an economic engine and then at night
it turns into a movie theater So its not an AIDS clinic
Its a community center So you can see ideas And these ideas developed into prototypes and they were eventually built And currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out
in Nigeria and Kenya From that we also developed Siyathemba The community came to us and said The problem is that the girls
dont have education And were working in an area where young women
between the ages of  and  have a  percent HIVAIDS rate And thats not
because theyre promiscuous its because theres no knowledge And so we decided to look
at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIVAIDS
outreach center and the coaches of the girls team
were also trained doctors So that there would be a very slow way
of developing confidence in health care And we picked nine finalists and then those nine finalists were
distributed throughout the entire region and then the community
picked their design They said this is our design because its not only
about engaging a community its about empowering a community and about getting them to be
a part of the rebuilding process So the winning design is here And then of course
we actually go and work with the community and the clients So this is the designer Hes out there working
with the first ever womens soccer team in KwaZuluNatal Siyathemba And they can tell it better A cappella singing
in a South African language Video Well my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza I work at the Africa Centre
Im an IT user consultant Im also the national football player
for South Africa Banyana Banyana And I also play in the Vodacom League
for the team called Tembisa which has now changed to Siyathemba This is our home ground Cameron Sinclair Im going to show that
later because Im running out of time I can see Chris looking at me slyly This was a connection
just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africas first
telemedicine center in Tanzania And we met literally
a couple of months ago Weve already developed a design The team is over there
working in partnership This was a matchmaking
thanks to a couple of TEDsters  Sun Microsystems
Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli who connected me
with this amazing African woman And we start construction in June
and it will be opened by TEDGlobal So when you come to TEDGlobal
you can check it out But what were known probably most for
is dealing with disasters and development and weve been involved
in a lot of issues such as the tsunami
and also things like Hurricane Katrina This is a dollar shelter
that can be easily assembled This is a communitydesigned
community center And what that means is we actually
live and work with the community and theyre part of the design process The kids actually get
involved in mapping out where the community center should be And then eventually the community
through skills training end up building the building with us Here is another school This is what the UN gave these guys
for six months   plastic tarps This was in August This was the replacement
thats supposed to last for two years When the rain comes down
you cant hear a thing and in the summer
its about  degrees inside So we said if the rains coming
down lets get fresh water So every one of our schools
has a rainwater collection system Very low cost three classrooms
and rainwater collection is  dollars This was raised by hot chocolate
sales in Atlanta Its built by the parents of the kids The kids are out there onsite
building the buildings And it opened a couple of weeks ago and theres  kids
that are now using the schools So disaster hits home We see the bad stories
on CNN and Fox and all that but we dont see the good stories Here is a community that got together
and they said no to waiting They formed a partnership
a diverse partnership of players to actually map out East Biloxi to figure out whos getting involved Weve had over  volunteers
rebuilding rehabbing homes Figuring out what FEMA regulations are not waiting for them to dictate
to us how you should rebuild Working with residents getting them out of their homes
so they dont get ill This is what theyre
cleaning up on their own Designing housing This house is going in
in a couple of weeks This is a rehabbed home
done in four days This is a utility room
for a woman who is on a walker Shes  years old
This is what FEMA gave her  bucks happened two days ago We put together very quickly a washroom Its built its running and she just
started a business today where shes washing
other peoples clothes These are the Calhouns Theyre photographers who had documented
the Lower Ninth for the last  years That was their home
and these are the photographs they took And were helping working with them
to create a new building Projects weve done Projects weve been a part of support Why dont aid agencies do this This is the UN tent This is the new UN tent
just introduced this year Quick to assemble Its got a flap  thats the invention It took  years to design this
and get it implemented in the field I was  years old Theres a problem here Luckily were not alone There are hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects
and designers and inventors around the world that are getting
involved in humanitarian work More hemp houses  its a theme
in Japan apparently Im not sure what theyre smoking This is a Grip Clip
designed by somebody who said All you need is some way
to attach membrane structures to physical support beams This guy designed for NASA
is now doing housing Im going to whip through this quickly because I know Ive got
only a couple of minutes So this is all done in the last two years I showed you something
that took  years to do And this is just a selection of things that were built
in the last couple of years From Brazil to India Mexico Alabama China Israel Palestine Vietnam The average age of a designer
who gets involved in this project is   thats how old I am So its a young  I just have to stop here
because Arup is in the room and this is the bestdesigned
toilet in the world If youre ever ever in India
go use this toilet Chris Luebkeman will tell you why Im sure thats how he wanted
to spend the party But the future is not going to be
the skyscraping cities of New York but this And when you look at this you see crisis What I see is many many inventors One billion people live in abject poverty We hear about them all the time Four billion live in growing
but fragile economies One in seven live
in unplanned settlements If we do nothing about the housing crisis
thats about to happen in  years one in three people
will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp Look left look right
one of you will be there How do we improve the living standards
of five billion people With  million solutions So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces
innovative and sustainable design to improve the living
conditions for everyone Chris Anderson Wait a sec 
thats your wish CS Thats my wish CA Thats his wish CS We started Architecture for Humanity
with  dollars and a website So Chris somehow decided
to give me  So why not this many people Opensource architecture is the way to go You have a diverse community
of participants  and were not just talking
about inventors and designers but were talking about the funding model My role is not as a designer its as a conduit between the design world
and the humanitarian world And what we need is something
that replicates me globally because I havent slept in seven years Secondly what will this thing be Designers want to respond
to issues of humanitarian crisis but they dont want
some company in the West taking their idea
and basically profiting from it So Creative Commons has developed
the Developing Nations license And what that means
is that a designer can  The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have
a Creative Commons license on it As soon as that is built anyone
in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents
and replicate it for free So why not allow designers
the opportunity to do this but still protect their rights here We want to have a community
where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested
in an earthquake in flood in all sorts of austere environments The reason thats important is I dont want to wait
for the next Katrina to find out if my house works Thats too late we need to do it now So doing that globally  and I want this whole thing
to work multilingually When you look at the face of an architect
most people think a grayhaired white guy I dont see that
I see the face of the world So I want everyone
from all over the planet to be able to be a part
of this design and development The idea of needsbased competitions  XPRIZE for the other  percent
if you want to call it that We also want to look
at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating
manufacturers  fab labs in every country When I hear about the  laptop
and its going to educate every child  educate every designer in the world Put one in every favela
every slum settlement Because you know what
Innovation will happen And I need to know that
Its called the leapback We talk about leapfrog technologies I write with Worldchanging and the one thing
weve been talking about is I learn more on the ground
than Ive ever learned here So lets take those ideas
adapt them and we can use them These ideas are supposed to be adaptable they should have
the potential for evolution they should be developed
by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world What will it take There should be a sheet I dont have time to read this
because Im going to be yanked off CA Lets just leave it up for a sec CS Well what will it take
You guys are smart So its going to take a lot
of computing power because I want the idea
that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate
in developing these designs but utilize the designs Also a process of reviewing the designs I want every Arup engineer
in the world to check and make sure that were doing stuff thats standing because those guys
are the best in the world Plug And so you know I want these  I just should note I have two laptops
and one of them is there and that has  designs on it If I drop that laptop  What happens So its important to have
these proven ideas put up there easy to use easy to get ahold of My mom once said Theres nothing worse
than being all mouth and no trousers Im fed up of talking about making change You only make it by doing it Weve changed FEMA guidelines
weve changed public policy weve changed international response 
based on building things So for me its important that we create
a real conduit for innovation and that its free innovation Think of free culture 
this is free innovation Somebody said this a couple of years back I will give points for those who know it But I think the man was maybe
 years too early So lets do it Thank you ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other Ive met a lot of different
people over the years and Ive filmed some of them from a dotcom executive in New York
who wanted to take over the world to a military press officer in Qatar who would rather not take over the world If youve seen the film
Control Room that was sent out youd understand a little bit why Thank you Wow Some of you watched it
Thats great Thats great So basically what Id like
to talk about today is a way for people to travel to meet people in a different way than  because you cant travel
all over the world at the same time And a long time ago 
well about  years ago  my mom had an exchange student And Im going to show you
slides of the exchange student This is Donna This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty This is my mother and aunt
teaching Donna how to ride a bike This is Donna eating ice cream And this is Donna teaching my aunt
how to do a Filipino dance I really think as the world
is getting smaller it becomes more and more important that we learn each others dance moves that we meet each other
we get to know each other we are able to figure out
a way to cross borders to understand each other to understand
peoples hopes and dreams what makes them laugh and cry And I know that we cant
all do exchange programs and I cant force everybody to travel Ive already talked about that
to Chris and Amy and they said that
theres a problem with this You cant force people free will And I totally support that
so were not forcing people to travel But Id like to talk
about another way to travel that doesnt require
a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera
a projector and a screen And thats what Im going
to talk to you about today I was asked that I speak a little bit
about where I personally come from and Cameron I dont know how
you managed to get out of that one but I think that building bridges
is important to me because of where I come from Im the daughter of an American mother and an EgyptianLebaneseSyrian father So Im the living product
of two cultures coming together No pun intended And Ive also been called as an EgyptianLebaneseSyrian American
with a Persian name the Middle East Peace Crisis So maybe me starting to take
pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides
of my family together  a way to take the worlds with me
a way to tell stories visually It all kind of started that way but I think that I really realized
the power of the image when I first went
to the garbagecollecting village in Egypt when I was about  My mother took me there Shes somebody who believes strongly
in community service and decided that this was something
that I needed to do And so I went there and I met
some amazing women there There was a center there where they were teaching
people how to read and write and get vaccinations
against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage And I began teaching there I taught English and I met
some incredible women there I met people that live
seven people to a room barely can afford their evening meal yet lived with this strength
of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities I got drawn into this community
and I began to take pictures there I took pictures of weddings
and older family members  things that they wanted memories of About two years after I started
taking these pictures the UN Conference
on Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference So I was  I was very excited It was my first exhibit of photographs
and they were all put up there and after about two days
they all came down except for three People were very upset very angry that I was showing
these dirty sides of Cairo and why didnt I cut
the dead donkey out of the frame And as I sat there I got very depressed I looked at this big empty wall
with three lonely photographs that were you know
very pretty photographs and I was like I failed at this But I was looking at this intense
emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people
just seeing these photographs Here I was this yearold pipsqueak
that nobody listened to and all of a sudden
I put these photographs on the wall and there were arguments
and they had to be taken down And I saw the power of the image
and it was incredible And I think the most important reaction
that I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone
to the garbage village themselves that would never have seen
that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use
photography and film to somehow bridge gaps
to bridge cultures bring people together cross borders And so thats what really
kind of started me off Did a stint at MTV made a film
called Startupcom and Ive done a couple of music films But in  when the war
in Iraq was about to start it was a very surreal feeling for me because before the war started there was kind of this media war
that was going on And I was watching television in New York and there seemed to be just one
point of view that was coming across and the coverage went
from the US State Department to embedded troops And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this
clean war and precision bombings and the Iraqis would be greeting
the Americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet
in the streets of Baghdad And I knew that there
was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East
where my parents were I knew that there was
a completely other story being told and I was thinking How are people
supposed to communicate with each other when theyre getting completely
different messages and nobody knows
what the others being told How are people supposed to have
any kind of common understanding or know how to move together
into the future So I knew that I had to go there I just wanted to be in the center I had no plan I had no funding I didnt even have a camera at the time 
I had somebody bring it there because I wanted
to get access to Al Jazeera George Bushs favorite channel and a place which I was very curious
about because its disliked by many governments across the Arab world and also called the mouthpiece
of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government So I was thinking this station
thats hated by so many people has to be doing something right Ive got to go see what this is all about And I also wanted to go see
Central Command which was  minutes away And that way I could get access
to how this news was being created  on the Arab side reaching the Arab world and on the US and Western side
reaching the US And when I went there and sat there and met these people
that were in the center of it and sat with these characters I met some surprising
very complex people And Id like to share with you
a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them and you listen to them and you allow them more
than a fivesecond sound bite The amazing complexity of people emerges Samir Khader Business as usual Iraq and then Iraq and then Iraq But between us if Im offered
a job with Fox Ill take it To change the Arab nightmare
into the American dream I still have that dream Maybe I will never be able to do it but I have plans for my children When they finish high school I will send them to America
to study there I will pay for their study And they will stay there Josh Rushing The night they showed
the POWs and the dead soldiers  Al Jazeera showed them  it was powerful because America
doesnt show those kinds of images Most of the news in America
wont show really gory images and this showed American soldiers
in uniform strewn about a floor a cold tile floor And it was revolting It was absolutely revolting It made me sick at my stomach And then what hit me was
the night before there had been some kind
of bombing in Basra and Al Jazeera had shown
images of the people And they were equally if not more
horrifying  the images were And I remember having seen it
in the Al Jazeera office and thought to myself Wow thats gross Thats bad And then going away and probably
eating dinner or something And it didnt affect me as much So the impact that had on me  me realizing that I just saw
people on the other side and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way
I was feeling that night and it upset me on a profound level that I wasnt as bothered
as much the night before It makes me hate war But it doesnt make me believe
that were in a world that can live without war yet Jehane Noujaim I was overwhelmed
by the response of the film We didnt know whether
it would be able to get out there We had no funding for it We were incredibly lucky
that it got picked up And when we showed the film in both the United States
and the Arab world we had such incredible reactions It was amazing to see how people
were moved by this film In the Arab world  and its not really by the film
its by the characters  I mean Josh Rushing was
this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things And when I showed the film
in the Middle East people wanted to meet Josh He kind of redefined us
as an American population People started to ask me
Where is this guy now Al Jazeera offered him a job And Samir on the other hand was also quite an interesting character
for the Arab world to see because it brought out the complexities
of this lovehate relationship that the Arab world has with the West In the United States I was blown away
by the motivations the positive motivations
of the American people when theyd see this film You know were criticized abroad for believing were the saviors
of the world in some way but the flip side of it is that actually when people do see
what is happening abroad and peoples reactions
to some of our policy abroad we feel this power that we need to  we feel like we have to get
the power to change things And I saw this with audiences This woman came up to me
after the screening and said You know I know this is crazy I saw the bombs being loaded
on the planes I saw the military going out to war but you dont understand
peoples anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals
and the victims of the war and how do we get out of this bubble How do we understand what
the other person is thinking Now I dont know whether
a film can change the world But I know the power of it I know that it starts people thinking
about how to change the world Now Im not a philosopher so I feel like I shouldnt
go into great depth on this but let film speak for itself
and take you to this other world Because I believe that film has
the ability to take you across borders Id like you to just sit back
and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world And these couple clips take you inside
of two of the most difficult conflicts that were faced with today The last  hours of two
Palestinian suicide bombers Paradise Now Man As long as there is injustice
someone must make a sacrifice Woman Thats no
sacrifice thats revenge If you kill theres no difference
between victim and occupier Man If we had airplanes we wouldnt
need martyrs thats the difference Woman The difference is that the Israeli
military is still stronger Man Then let us be equal in death We still have Paradise Woman There is no Paradise
It only exists in your head Man God forbid May God forgive you If you were not Abu Azzams daughter  Anyway Id rather have Paradise
in my head than live in this hell In this life were dead anyway One only chooses bitterness
when the alternative is even bitterer Woman And what about us
The ones who remain Will we win that way Dont you see what youre
doing is destroying us And that you give Israel
an alibi to carry on Man So with no alibi Israel will stop Woman Perhaps We have
to turn it into a moral war Man How if Israel has no morals Woman Be careful And the real people building
peace through nonviolence Encounter Point Video Ambulance siren
Tel Aviv Israel  Tzvika My wife Ayelet
called me and said  There was a suicide
bombing in Tel Aviv Ayelet What do you know
about the casualties Tzvika offscreen
Were looking for three girls We have no information Ayelet One is wounded here but we
havent heard from the other three Tzvika I said OK
thats BatChen thats my daughter Are you sure she is dead They said yes Video Police siren
and shouting over megaphone Bethlehem Occupied
Palestinian Territories  George On that day at around  I was driving with my wife
and daughters to the supermarket When we got to here  we saw three Israeli military jeeps
parked on the side of the road When we passed by the first jeep  they opened fire on us And my yearold daughter Christine was killed in the shooting Bereaved Families Forum Jerusalem Tzvika Im the headmaster
for all parts George But there is a teacher
that is in charge Tzvika Yes I have assistants I deal with children all the time One year after their daughters deaths
both Tzvika and George join the forum George At first I thought
it was a strange idea But after thinking logically about it  I didnt find any reason
why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering Tzvika There were
many things that touched me We see that there are Palestinians
who suffered a lot who lost children and still believe in the peace
process and in reconciliation If we who lost what is most precious
can talk to each other and look forward to a better future then everyone else must do so too From South Africa
A Revolution Through Music Amandla Music Video Man Song is something
that we communicated with people who otherwise would not have
understood where were coming from You could give them
a long political speech they would still not understand But I tell you when you finish that song people will be like Damn I know
where you niggas are coming from I know where you guys are coming from Death unto apartheid Narrator Its about
the liberation struggle Its about those children
who took to the streets  fighting screaming
Free Nelson Mandela Its about those unions
who put down their tools and demanded freedom Yes Yes Music and singing Singing Freedom Jehane Noujaim I think everybodys
had that feeling of sitting in a theater in a dark room with other strangers
watching a very powerful film and they felt that feeling
of transformation And what Id like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create
a movement through film Ive been listening to the talks
in the conference and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation
for another persons humanity then they will have
an appreciation for ours And thats what this is about Its about connecting people through film getting these independent
voices out there Now Josh Rushing actually
ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera So his feeling is that
hes at Al Jazeera International because he feels like
he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West And thats an amazing thing But Ive been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices to give power to the filmmakers to give power to people who are trying
to use film for change And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already Theres Witness
that you heard from earlier Theres Just Vision that are working
with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace
and documenting that process and getting interviews
out there and using this film to take to Congress to show
that its a powerful tool to show that this is a woman whos had
her daughter killed in an attack and she believes that there
are peaceful ways to solve this Theres Working Films
and theres Current TV which is an incredible platform
for people around the world to be able to put their  Yeah its amazing Ive watched it and Im blown away by it and its potential to bring voices
from around the world  independent voices
from around the world  and create a truly democratic
global television So what can we do to create
a platform for these organizations to create some momentum to get everybody in the world
involved in this movement Id like for us to imagine for a second Imagine a day when you have everyone
coming together from around the world You have towns and villages
and theaters  all from around the world getting together and sitting in the dark and sharing a communal
experience of watching a film or a couple of films together Watching a film which maybe highlights
a character that is fighting to live or just a character
that defies stereotypes makes a joke sings a song Comedies documentaries shorts This amazing power
can be used to change people and to bond people together
to cross borders and have people feel like
theyre having a communal experience So if you imagine this day
when all around the world you have theaters and places
where we project films If you imagine projecting
from Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo the same film in Ramallah
the same film in Jerusalem You know weve been talking
to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China Its endless what you can imagine in terms of where you can project films and where you can have
this communal experience And I believe that this one day
if we can create it this one day can create momentum
for all of these independent voices There isnt an organization
which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there and yet Im hearing
throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other and having mutual respect
for the other and crossing borders And if film can do that and if we can get all of these
different locations in the world to watch these films together  this could be an incredible day So weve already made a partnership set up through somebody
from the TED community John Camen who introduced me
to Steven Apkon from the Jacob Burns Film Center And we started calling up everybody And in the last week there have been so many people
that have responded to us from as close as Palo Alto
to Mongolia and to India There are people that want to be
a part of this global day of film to be able to provide a platform
for independent voices and independent films to get out there Now weve thought
about a name for this day and Id like to share this with you Now the most amazing part
of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes and so I invite you
to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future How do we use technology to make
this day echo into the future so that we can build community and have these communities working
together through the Internet There was a time many many years ago when all of the continents
were stuck together And we call that landmass Pangea So what wed like to call this day of film
is Pangea Cinema Day And if you just imagine that all of these people
in these towns would be watching then I think that we can
actually really make a movement towards people understanding
each other better I know that its very intangible
touching peoples hearts and souls but the only way that I know how to do it the only way that I know how to reach out
to somebodys heart and soul all across the world
is by showing them a film And I know that there are independent
filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen And thats my wish I guess Im supposed to give you
my onesentence wish but were way out of time Chris Anderson
That is an incredible wish Pangea Cinema The day
the world comes together JN Its more tangible than world peace
and its certainly more immediate But it would be the day that the world
comes together through film the power of film CA Ladies and gentlemen Jehane Noujaim ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56,Walk around for four months with three wishes and all the ideas will start to percolate up I think everybody should do it  think that youve got three wishes And what would you do Its actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important and really reflect on the world around us And thinking that can an individual actually do something or come up with something that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference Inspired by nature  thats the theme here And I think quite frankly thats where I started I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian We have this Great North And there was a pretty small population and my father was an avid outdoorsman So I really had a chance to experience that And I could never really understand exactly what it was or how it was informing me But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing thats happening and that the nature that you see out there  the untouched shorelines the untouched forest that I was able to see  really bring in a sense of that geological time that this has gone on for a long time and were experiencing it in a different way And that to me was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did And I did go out and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring along a roadside This rebirth of grass And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape But as a fineart photographer I somehow felt that it wouldnt catch on out there that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fineart career And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture or something of that nature and I couldnt get away from it So I started to think of how can I rethink the landscape I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that weve transformed I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway And I ended up in a town called Frackville I got out of the car and I stood up and it was a coalmining town I did a  turnaround and that became one of the most surreal landscapes Ive ever seen Totally transformed by man And that got me to go out and look at mines like this and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find And that became the baseline of what I was doing And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto and not have to reinvent myself  that this theme was large enough to become a lifes work to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks which I kind of missed was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs  to get into that place to make those photographs and if it wasnt for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations I would have never made this body of work So in that respect to me Im not against the corporation I own a corporation I work with them and I feel that we all need them and theyre important But I am also for sustainability So theres this thing that is pulling me in both directions And Im not making an indictment towards whats happening here but it is a slow progression So I started thinking well we live in all these ages of man the Stone Age and the Iron Age and the Copper Age And these ages of man are still at work today But weve become totally disconnected from them Theres something that were not seeing there And its a scary thing as well Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles and what were doing to that landscape  that to me is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate And through my photographs Im hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image Not to say Oh my God what is it but to be challenged by it  to say Wow this is beautiful on one level but on the other level This is scary I shouldnt be enjoying it Like a forbidden pleasure And its that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there and it gets people to look at these things and it gets people to enter it And it also in a way defines kind of what I feel too  that Im drawn to have a good life I want a house and I want a car But theres this consequence out there And how do I begin to have that attraction repulsion Its even in my own conscience Im having it and here in my work Im trying to build that same toggle These things that I photographed  this tire pile here had  million tires in it It was the largest one It was only about an hourandahalf away from me and it caught fire about four years ago Its around Westley California around Modesto And I decided to start looking at something that to me had  if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature in the recycling work that youre seeing here was starting to point to a direction To me it was our redemption That in the recycling work that I was doing Im looking for a practice a human activity that is sustainable That if we keep putting things through industrial and urban existence back into the system  if we keep doing that  we can continue on Of course listening at the conference theres many many things that are coming Biomimicry and theres many other things that are coming on stream  nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart And we all look forward to those things But in the meantime these things are scaling up These things are continuing to happen What youre looking at here  I went to Bangladesh so I started to move away from North America I started to look at our world globally These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to They were talking about Exxon Valdez and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned and  was going to be the pinnacle And I thought My God wouldnt that be something To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand literally in thirdworld countries So originally I was going to go to India And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there and then I was able to get into Bangladesh and saw for the first time a third world a view of it that I had never actually thought was possible  million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin  people everywhere  the pollution was intense and the working conditions were horrible Here youre looking at some oil fields in California some of the biggest oil fields And again I started to think that  there was another epiphany  that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil And that to me was again something that I started building on and I continued to build on So this is a series Im hoping to have ready in about two or three years under the heading of The Oil Party Because I think everything that were involved in  our clothing our cars our roads and everything  are directly a result Im going to move to some pictures of China And for me China  I started photographing it four years ago and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind not to mention that China as well has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around I came out of a bluecollar town a GM town and my father worked at GM so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work But you know to see China and the scale at which its evolving is quite something So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam and this is the largest dam by  percent ever attempted by man Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said Its just too big In fact when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning It took fifteen days to fill it So this created a reservoir  kilometers long one of the largest reservoirs ever created And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving  fullsize cities up out of the reservoir and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships This is a before and after So that was before And this is like  weeks later demolished by hand I think  of the buildings they used dynamite everything else was by hand That was  weeks later And this gives you an idea And it was all the people who lived in those homes were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart And these are some of the images from that So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam looking at that massive transformation of a landscape And it looks like a bombedout landscape but it isnt What it is its a landscape that is an intentional one This is a need for power and theyre willing to go through this massive transformation on this scale to get that power And again its actually a relief for whats going on in China because I think on the table right now theres  nuclear power stations to be built There hasnt been one built in North America for  years because of the NIMBY problem  Not In My BackYard But in China theyre saying No were putting in  in the next  years And coalburning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges  a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that And  to  million people were relocated depending on whose statistics youre looking at And this is what they were building This is Wushan one of the largest cities that was relocated This is the town hall for the city And again the rebuilding of the city  to me it was sad to see that they didnt really grab a lot of I guess what we know here in terms of urban planning There were no parks there were no green spaces Very highdensity living on the side of a hill And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up but somehow were not connecting with them Here is a sign that translated says Obey the birth control law Build our science civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth So here if you look at this poster it has all the trappings of Western culture Youre seeing the tuxedos the bouquets But whats really to me frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background So its like marrying up all the things that we have and its an adaptation of our way of life full stop And again when you start seeing that kind of embrace and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint it starts to become very sobering This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong  and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country And theres about  million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times and in the next  to  years are expecting another  to  million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers The manufacturers are  the domestics are usually  you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms So this is a pink uniform at this factory Its a shoe factory And they have dorms for the workers So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms This is one of the biggest shoe factories the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen It has  employees making shoes This is a shift change one of three Theres two factories of this scale in the same town This is one with  so every lunch theres about  coming through for lunch They sit down they have about  minutes The next round comes in Its an incredible workforce thats building there Shanghai  Im looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years Whats also happening in Shanghai is  China is changing because this wouldnt have happened five years ago for instance This is a holdout Theyre called dengzahoos  theyre like pin tacks to the ground They wont move Theyre not negotiating Theyre not getting enough so theyre not going to move And so theyre holding off until they get a deal with them And theyve been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal Theyre being put out about two hours  the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years or maybe even thousands of years are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai Probably the largest urbanrenewal project I think ever attempted on the planet And then the embrace of the things that theyre replacing it with  again one of my wishes and I never ended up going there was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something and these are called the villas And also like right now theyre just moving The scaffolding is still on and this is an ewaste area and if you looked in the foreground on the big print youd see that the industry  their industry  theyre all recycling So the industrys already growing around these new developments This is a fivelevel bridge in Shanghai Shanghai was a very intriguing city  its exploding on a level that I dont think any city has experienced In fact even Shenzhen the economic zone  one of the first ones   years ago was about  people and today it boasts about  to  million So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which  this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen Theres  of them here and theyre being built for most of the big cities Beijing and Shanghai Shenzhen And this isnt even the domestic car market this is the taxi market And what we would see here as a suburban development  a similar thing but theyre all highrises So theyll put  or  up at a time and they just go up in the same way as a singlefamily dwelling would go up here in an area And the density is quite incredible And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings I was shocked to see that theyre not using a central airconditioning system every window has an air conditioner in it And Im sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies but I cant imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale And when you start looking at that and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai its literally a forest of skyscrapers Its breathtaking in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming And you can see in the foreground of this picture its still one of the last areas that was being held up Right now thats all cleared out  this was done about eight months ago  and highrises are now going up into that central spot So a skyscraper is built literally overnight in Shanghai Most recently I went in and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China And this is Baosteel right outside of Shanghai This is the coal supply for the steel factory   square kilometers Its an incredibly massive operation I think  workers five cupolas and the sixth ones coming in here So theyre building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot And again looking at these images theres this constant like haze that youre seeing This is going to show you real time an assembler Its a circuit breaker  hours a day at this speed I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China is that theyre using a lot of the latest production technology In that one there were  people that worked on the floor And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers and then I went and looked at each one of them for about  or  minutes and picked this one woman And it was just lightning fast the way she was working was almost unbelievable But that is the trick that theyve got right now that theyre winning with is that theyre using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines and bringing all the components into play but the assembly is where theyre actually bringing in  the country workers are very willing to work They want to work Theres a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs That conditions going to be there for the next  to  years if they realize what they want which is you know  to  million more people coming into the cities In this particular case  this is the assembly line that you saw this is a shot of it I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field I had to have them freeze for  seconds to get this shot It took me five fake tries because they were just going To slow them down was literally impossible They were just wound up doing these things all day long until the manager had to with a stern voice say Okay everybody freeze It wasnt too bad but theyre driven to produce these things at an incredible rate This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk an oil byproduct And what youre seeing here is again one of the most stateoftheart textile mills There are  of these machines theyre worth about  dollars each So you have about  people running this and theyre just inspecting it  and theyre just walking the lines The machines are all running absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are And I started getting in further and further into the factories And thats a diptych I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together pregoing into the textile mills Heres something thats far more laborintensive which is the making of shoes This floor has about  workers on this floor The company itself had about  employees and theyre doing domestic shoes It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas and thats very hard to get And they dont want to let me in But the domestic was much easier to do It just gives you a sense of again  and thats where really the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes Nike was one of the early ones It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market This is a hightech mobile phone Bird mobile phone one of the largest mobile makers in China I think mobile phone companies are popping up literally on a weekly basis and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones This is a textile where theyre doing shirts  Youngor the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms Everything is very efficient While setting up this shot people on average would spend eight to  minutes having a lunch This was one of the biggest factories Ive ever seen They make coffeemakers here the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers  they make  million of them in the world Theres  employees This one factory  and they had several of them  is half a kilometer long These are just recently shot  I just came back about a month ago so youre the first ones to be seeing these these new factory pictures Ive taken So its taken me almost a year to gain access into these places The other aspect of whats happening in China is that theres a real need for materials there So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships Thats cubed metal This is armatures electrical armatures where theyre getting the copper and the highend steel from electrical motors out and recycling them This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley But this is what happens to most of the computers Fifty percent of the worlds computers end up in China to be recycled Its referred to as ewaste there And it is a bit of a problem The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes which are used all through China but they heat up the boards and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components Theyre trying to get all the valued metals out of those components But the toxic smells  when you come into a town thats actually doing this kind of burning of the boards you can smell it a good five or  kilometers before you get there Heres another operation Its all cottage industries so its not big places  its all in peoples front porches in their backyards even in their homes theyre burning boards if theres a concern for somebody coming by  because it is considered in China to be illegal doing it but they cant stop the product from coming in This portrait  Im not usually known for portraits but I couldnt resist this one where shes been through Mao and shes been through the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and now shes sitting on her porch with this ewaste beside her Its quite something This is a road where its been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where theyre recycling So thats the photographs that I wanted to show you I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls Theyve been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while Ive been thinking Ones Megan the one of the right and Katja there And to me the whole notion  the things Im photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress And as much as there are great things around the corner  and its palpable in this room  of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems Im really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect And it isnt something that isnt just affecting our world but it starts to go up  because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down  but theres a growing footprint thats happening in Asia and is growing at a rapid rapid rate and so I dont think we can equalize it So ultimately the strategy I think here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well So part of my thinking and part of my wishes is sitting with these thoughts in mind and thinking about How is their life going to be when they want to have children or when theyre ready to get married  years from now  or whatever  years from now And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking  in my work and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes Wish one worldchanging I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea Oh and I went in search  I wanted to put what I had in mind hitch it onto something I didnt want a wish just to start from nowhere One of them Im starting from almost nothing but the other one I wanted to find out whats going on thats working right now And Worldchangingcom is a fantastic blog and that blog is now being visited by close to halfamillion people a month And it just started about  months ago And the beauty of whats going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like What theyre doing there is that theyre not  I think the environmental movement has failed in that its used the stick too much its used the apocalyptic tone too much it hasnt sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements about how to change our world in a better way quickly And its looking at technology and its looking at new energysaving devices and its looking at how to rethink and how to restrategize the movement towards sustainability And so for me one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchangingcom website Some of you might know hes a TEDster  Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts And this is still in preliminary stages these arent the finals But these images with Worldchangingcom can be placed into any kind of media They could be posted through the Web they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter or anything of that nature So were looking at this as trying to build out And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text and the text is blasted all over What was unusual according to Stephen is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image And so in this case because its about a lot of these images and what they represent and the kinds of questions they bring up that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say Well whats Worldchangingcom with these images have to do And hopefully inspire people to go to that website So Worldchangingcom and building that blog and it is a blog and Im hoping that it isnt  I dont see it as the kind of blog where were all going to follow each other to death This one is one that will spoke out and will go out and to start reaching Because right now theres conversations in India in China in South America  theres entries coming from all around the world I think theres a chance to have a dialogue a conversation about sustainability at Worldchangingcom And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic Wish two is more of the bottomup groundup one that Im trying to work with And this one is I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on and invent ideas on sustainability And one of the things that came out  Allison who actually nominated me said something earlier on in a brainstorming She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six And you think about it you know grade four  my wife and I we say age seven is the age of reason so theyre into the age of reason And theyre prepuberty So its this great window where they actually are  you can influence them You know what happens at puberty You know we know that from earlier presentations So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas Let them understand what sustainability is and that they have a vested interest in it to happen And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize so I would take  or  dollars of the winnings and the rest is going to be to manage this project but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these  call them prize targets And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an inschool project the best one for a household project or it could be the best community project for sustainability And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for In My World And what would happen  its a scalable thing And if we can get people to put in things  whether its equipment like a media lab or money to make the prize significant enough  and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools or schools that are with kids that age and make it a wideopen competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them And the prize has to be a verifiable thing so its not about just ideas The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them but the actual things have to be verifiable In that way whats happening is that were motivating a certain age group to start thinking And theyre going to push that up from the bottom  up into I believe into the households And parents will be reacting to it and trying to help them with the projects And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way and starts to teach them They know about recycling now but they dont really I think get sustainability in all the things and the energy footprint and how that matters And to teach them to me would be a fantastic wish and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into And again in In My World the competition  we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it And I like the words in my world because it gives possession of the world to the person whos doing it It is my world its not someone elses I want to help it I want to do something with it So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations  and great ideas I think come from kids  and engage their imagination into a project and do something for schools I think all schools could use extra equipment extra cash  its going to be an incentive for them to do that And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for In My World And wish three is Imax film So I was told I should do one for myself and Ive always wanted to actually get involved with doing something And the scale of my work and the kinds of ideas Im playing with  when I first saw an Imax film I almost immediately thought Theres a real resonance between what Im trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer And I think theres a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance So Im looking really for a mentor because I just had my birthday Im  and I dont have time to go back to school right now  Im too busy So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catchup course on how to do something like that and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this That would be fantastic So those are my three wishes

57,Im going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on  to a  million people which we will hope to see happen We discussed in the prior film some of the old things that we did like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic And Id like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people At the present time it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient before that patient arrives at an emergency room And people with silent ischemia  which translated into English means they dont have any symptoms  it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital The AMI Acute Myocardial Infarction which is a doctors big word so they can charge you more money   means a heart attack Annual incidence  million Americans Mortality  people dying each year About half of them  have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on Thus  people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle Symptoms are often denied by the patient particularly us men because we are very brave We are very brave and we dont want to admit that Im having a hell of a chest pain Then approximately  percent of all patients never have any symptoms What are we going to do about them How can we save their lives Its particularly true of diabetics and elderly women Well what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack A means to determine if theres a complete blockage of a coronary artery That ladies and gentlemen is a heart attack The means consist of noting something a little technical ST segment elevation of the electrogram  translated into English that means that if theres an electrical signal in the heart and one part of the ECG  which we call the ST segment  elevates that is a sure sign of a heart attack And if we had a computer put into the body of a person whos at risk we could know before they even have symptoms that theyre having a heart attack to save their life Well the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm vibration like your cell phone but right by your clavicle bone And when it goes beep beep beep you better do something about it because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment So we have to try these devices out because the FDA wont just let us use them on people unless we try it out first and the best model for this happens to be pigs And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin like you see in an emergency room and Im going to show you why they dont work very well And then we put a lead which is a wire in the right ventricle inside the heart which does the electrogram which is the signal voltage from inside the heart Well with the pig at the baseline before we blocked the pigs artery to simulate a heart attack that was the signal After  seconds even an expert couldnt tell the difference and after three minutes  well if you really studied it youd see a difference But what happened when we looked inside the pigs heart to the electrogram There was the baseline  first of all a much bigger and more reliable signal Second of all Ill bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line Look at the difference there It doesnt take much  every layperson could see that difference and computers can be programmed to easily detect it Then look at that after three minutes We see that the signal thats actually in the heart we can use it to tell people that theyre having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life Then we tried it with my son Dr Tim Fischell we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in Well he kept the balloon filled to block the artery to simulate a blockage which is what a heart attack is And its not hard to see that  the baseline is the first picture on the upper left Next to it at  seconds you see this rise here then this rise  thats the ST elevation And if we had a computer that could detect it we could tell you youre having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure And then he did it again We filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see even after  seconds a great rise in this piece which we can have computers inside under your chest like a pacemaker with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker And computers dont go to sleep We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement What does the system look like Well on the left is the IMD which is Implantable Medical Device and tonight in the tent you can see it  theyve exhibited it Its about this big the size of a pacemaker Its implanted with very conventional techniques And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table Itll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because if you dont youre in deep doodoo And then finally a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation which is the level which says you are having a heart attack The FDA says OK test this final device after its built in some animal which we said is a pig so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack And when you go to the farmyard you cant easily get pigs to have heart attacks so we said well were experts in stents Tonight youll see some of our invented stents We said so well put in a stent but were not going to put in a stent that wed put in people Were putting in a copper stent and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks Thats not very nice but after all we had to find out what the answer is So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig and let me show you the result thats very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned So there it was Thursday morning we stopped the pigs medication and there is his electrogram the signal from inside the pigs heart coming out by radio telemetry Then on Friday at  he began to get certain signs which later we had the pig run around  Im not going to go into this early stage But look what happened at  after we removed this pigs medication that kept him from having a heart attack Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation Can you see it there Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS  you see ST elevation This pig at  was having a heart attack What happens after you have the heart attack this blockage Your rhythm becomes irregular and thats what happened  minutes later Then ventricular fibrillation the heart quivers instead of beats  this is just before death of the pig  and then the pig died it went flatline But we had a little bit over an hour where we couldve saved this pigs life Well because of the FDA we didnt save the pigs life because we need to do this type of animal research for humans But when it comes to the sake of a human we can save their life We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack What is the response to acute myocardial infarction a heart attack today Well you feel some chest pain or indigestion Its not all that bad you decide not to do anything Several hours pass and it gets worse and even the man wont ignore it Finally you go to the emergency room You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated because  percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains dont have AMI so youre not taken very seriously They finally see you It takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it and its hard to do because they dont have the baseline data which the computer we put in you gets Finally if youre lucky you are treated in three or four hours after the incident but the heart muscle has died And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world  not Africa  thats the typical treatment in the advanced world today So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian And when you have a blockage the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device which gets your baseline electrogram from  hours ago and the one that caused the alarm so you can take it to the emergency room and show them and say take care of me right away Then it goes to a network operations center where they get your data from your patient database thats been put in at some central location say in the United States Then it goes to a diagnostic center and within one minute of your heart attack your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is And the person whos there the medical practitioner calls you  this is also a cell phone  and says Mr Smith youre in deep doodoo you have a problem Weve called the ambulance The ambulance is on the way Itll pick you up and then were going to call your doctor tell him about it Were going to send him the signal that we have that says you have a heart attack and were going to send the signal to the hospital and were going to have it analyzed there and there youre going to be with your doctor and youll be taken care of so you wont die of a heart attack Thats the first invention that I wanted to describe And now I want to talk about something entirely different At first I didnt think migraine headaches were a big problem because Id never had a migraine headache but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life and their lives are being totally ruined by it We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine which is Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe controlled magnetic pulse applied as needed by the patient Now youre probably very few physicists here If youre a physicist youd know theres a certain Faradays Law which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water  thats your brains by the way  itll generate electric currents and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache Thats what we have discovered So heres a picture of what were doing The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons  thats shown in red  that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the midbrain And when it hits the midbrain thats when the headache begins Theres this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura and this visual aura by the way  and Ill show you a picture  but it sort of begins with little dancing lights gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field And what we tried was this here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES Weighs about  pounds has a wire about an inch in diameter And heres one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache bad one after the aura What do we do This is what an aura looks like Its sort of funny dancing lights shown there on the left and right side And thats a fully developed visual aura as we see on top In the middle our experimentalist the neurologist who said Im going to move this down a little and Im going to erase half your aura And by God the neurologist did erase it and thats the middle picture half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse What does that mean That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current thats interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain And finally he says OK now Im going to   all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse What is the result We designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this that you could have  a lady in her pocket book  and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works Well the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News Channel  last week in New York City in the  oclock news Anchor For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches  and there are  million Americans who do  tonight a possible answer Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away Christina Sidebottom Well my first reaction was that it was  looked awfully gunlike and it was very strange Stacy Sager But for Christina Sidebottom almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper say it is scientifically sound  that in fact when the average person gets a migraine its caused by something similar to an electrical impulse The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that Yousef Mohammed In other words were treating electricity with electricity rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that were using nowadays SS But is it safe to use everyday Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade and more longterm studies need to be done Christina now swears by it CS Its been the most wonderful thing for my migraine SS Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer Robert Fischell And that is the invention to treat migraines You see the problem is  million Americans have migraine headaches and we need a means to treat it and I think that we now have it And this is the first device that we did and Im going to talk about my second wish which has something to do with this Our conclusions from our studies so far at three research centers is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches not only those with aura get treated and get diminished And auras can be erased and the migraine then does not occur And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on The third and last invention began with an idea Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation Now why do we use  add on nearly an epileptic focus Now unfortunately us technical people unlike Mr Bono have to get into all these technical words Well responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense at a place in your brain which is called an epileptic focus which is where the epileptic seizure begins  we sense there that its going to happen and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot which erases the errant signal so that you dont get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology thats used for the heart We thought we could adapt it for the brain The device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around Form a company to develop a neuropacemaker for epilepsy as well as other diseases of the brain because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it that causes many if not all of brain disorders We formed a company called NeuroPace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation and this is a picture of what the device looked like thats placed into the cranial bone This is probably a better picture Here we have our device in which we put in a frame Theres a cut made in the scalp its opened the neurosurgeon has a template he marks it around and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device And tonight youll be able to see the device in the tent And then with four screws we put in a frame then we snap in the device and we run with wires  the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes to the epileptic focus the origin of the epilepsy where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure In the blue wire we see whats called a deep brain electrode If thats the source of the epilepsy we can attack that as well The comprehensive solution this is the device its about one inches by two inches and oddly enough just the thickness of most cranial bones The advantages of responsive neurostimulation It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur provide stimulation only when needed can be turned off if seizures disappear it has minimal side effects  as a matter of fact in all our clinical trials to date weve seen no side effects in the  or so patients in whom its been implanted  and its invisible cosmetically hidden so if you have epilepsy and you have the device no one will know it because you cant tell that its there And this shows what an electroencephalogram is and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients Then we stimulated and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal which means they did not get the epileptic seizure That concludes my discussion of epilepsy which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon I have three wishes Well I cant do much about Africa Im a tech Im into medical gadgetry which is mostly hightech stuff like Mr Bono talked about The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator called RNS for Responsive NeuroStimulator  thats a brilliant acronym  for the treatment of other brain disorders Well if were going to do it for epilepsy why the hell not try it for something else Then you saw what that device looked like that the woman was using to fix her migraines I tell you this thats something which some research engineer like me would concoct not a real designer of good equipment We want to have some people who really know how to do this perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations Then were going to challenge the TED attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA where we have problems that Africa doesnt have And by reducing malpractice litigation  malpractice litigation is not an African problem its an American problem So to get quickly to my first wish  the brain operates by electrical signals If the electrical signals create a brain disorder electrostimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brains neurons In other words if youve screwed up electrical signals maybe by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain we can counteract that A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electrostimulation like were doing with epilepsy But even if there is no signal electrostimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder And consider treating psychotic disorders  and I want this involved with the TED group  such as obsessivecompulsive disorder that presently is not well treated with drugs and includes five million Americans And Mr Fischer and his group at NeuroPace and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world That is the first wish The second wish is at the present time the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators  thats what TMS means device to treat migraine headaches  appears to be quite successful Well thats the good news The present portable device is far from optimally designed both as to human factors as appearance I think she said it looks like a gun A lot of people dont like guns Engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches And that is the second wish And of the dollar prize money that TED was so generous to give me I am donating  dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD obsessivecompulsive disorder and Im making another  available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines And thats how Ill use my dollar prize money Well the third and final wish is somewhat  unfortunately its much more complicated because it involves lawyers Well medical malpractice litigation in the US has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance so that competent physicians are leaving their practice Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury because this patient really ended up badly The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs Ive seen pictures graphs in todays USA Today showing it skyrocketing out of control and this is one factor Well how can the TED community help with this situation I have a couple of ideas to begin with As a starting point for discussion with the TED group a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign For example I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent Would you believe  pages single space the patient has to read before theyre in our trial to cure their epilepsy What do you think someone has at the end of reading  singlespaced pages They dont understand what the hell its about Thats the present system How about making a video We have entertainment people here we have people who know how to do videos with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient where they see the video and theyre being videoed and they press do you understand this No I dont Well then lets go to a simpler explanation Then theres a simpler one and oh yes I understand that Well press the button and youre on record you understand And that is one of the ideas Now also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done including all the possible failure modes The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs Now in America in fact you cannot give up your right to trial by jury However if a video is there that everything was explained to you and you have it all in the video file itll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency because it wont be nearly as good a case If a medical error occurs the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone These are just some starting points And so there thats the end of all my wishes I wish I had more wishes but three is what Ive got and there they are ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

58,"Im the luckiest guy in the world I got to see the last case
of killer smallpox in the world I was in India this past year and I may have seen
the last cases of polio in the world Theres nothing that makes
you feel more  the blessing and the honor
of working in a program like that  than to know that something
that horrible no longer exists So Im going to tell you  so Im going to show you
some dirty pictures They are difficult to watch
but you should look at them with optimism because the horror
of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing
that they no longer exist But first Im going to tell you
a little bit about my own journey My background is not exactly
the conventional medical education that you might expect When I was an intern in San Francisco I heard about a group of Native Americans
who had taken over Alcatraz Island and a Native American
who wanted to give birth on that island and no other doctor wanted
to go and help her give birth I went out to Alcatraz and I lived
on the island for several weeks She gave birth I caught
the baby I got off the island I landed in San Francisco and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island
made me an expert in Indian affairs I wound up on every television show Someone saw me on television
they called me up and they asked me if Id like to be in a movie
and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars
who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England And I said yes I would do that so I became the doctor
in an absolutely awful movie called Medicine Ball Caravan Now you know from the s youre either on the bus
or youre off the bus I was on the bus My wife of  years and I joined the bus Our bus ride took us
from San Francisco to London then we switched buses at the big pond We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey
and Iran Afghanistan over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan
like every other young doctor This is us at the Khyber Pass
and thats our bus We had some difficulty getting
over the Khyber Pass But we wound up in India And then like everyone else
in our generation we went to live in a Himalayan monastery This is just like a residency program for those of you
that are in medical school And we studied with a wise man
a guru named Karoli Baba who then told me to get rid of the dress put on a threepiece suit go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World
Health Organization And he made an outrageous prediction
that smallpox would be eradicated and that this was Gods gift to humanity because of the hard work
of dedicated scientists And that prediction came true This little girl is Rahima Banu and she was the last case
of killer smallpox in the world And this document is the certificate
that the global commission signed certifying the world to have eradicated
the first disease in history The key to eradicating smallpox
was early detection early response Im going to ask you to repeat that
early detection early response Can you say that Audience Early detection early response Larry Brilliant Smallpox
was the worst disease in history It killed more people
than all the wars in history In the last century
it killed  million people Youre reading about Larry Page already Somebody reads very fast In the year that Larry Page
and Sergey Brin  with whom I have a certain affection
and a new affiliation  in the year in which they were born two million people died of smallpox We declared smallpox eradicated in  This is the most important slide
that Ive ever seen in public health Sovereigns killed by smallpox
because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest and to be kings and queens of the world did not protect you
from dying of smallpox Never can you doubt
that we are all in this together But to see smallpox
from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective You should see it
from the perspective of a mother watching her child develop
this disease and standing by helplessly Day one day two day three day four day five day six Youre a mother and youre
watching your child and on day six you see
pustules that become hard Day seven they show the classic scars
of smallpox umbilication Day eight And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed
image in the world the most printed image in the world was that of the Earth But this was in 
and as of that moment this photograph was the photograph
that was the most widely printed because we printed two billion copies
of this photograph and we took them
hand to hand door to door to show people and ask them
if there was smallpox in their house because that was our surveillance system We didnt have Google
we didnt have web crawlers we didnt have computers By day nine  you look at this picture
and youre horrified I look at this picture
and I say Thank God because its clear that this is only
an ordinary case of smallpox and I know this child will live And by day  the lesions
are scabbing his eyelids are swollen but you know this child has
no other secondary infection And by day  while he will be
scarred for life he will live There are other kinds of smallpox
that are not like that This is confluent smallpox in which there isnt a single place
on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions Flat smallpox which killed  percent
of people who got it And hemorrhagic smallpox
the most cruel of all which had a predilection
for pregnant women Ive probably had  women die They all had hemorrhagic smallpox Ive never seen anybody die from it
who wasnt a pregnant woman In  the WHO embarked
on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease In that year there were  countries
affected with smallpox By  we were down to  countries  we were down to five countries But in that year
smallpox exploded throughout India And India was the place
where smallpox made its last stand In  India had
a population of  million There are  linguistic states in India which is like saying
 different countries There are  million people
on the road at any time in buses and trains walking
 villages  million households and none of them wanted to report if they had a case
of smallpox in their house because they thought that smallpox
was the visitation of a deity Shitala Mata the cooling mother and it was wrong to bring
strangers into your house when the deity was in the house No incentive to report smallpox It wasnt just India
that had smallpox deities smallpox deities were
prevalent all over the world So how we eradicated smallpox was  mass vaccination wouldnt work You could vaccinate everybody in India but one year later thered be
 million new babies which was then the population of Canada It wouldnt do just to vaccinate everyone You had to find every single
case of smallpox in the world at the same time and draw
a circle of immunity around it And thats what we did In India alone my  best friends
and I went door to door with that same picture to every single house in India We made over one billion house calls And in the process
I learned something very important Every time we did a housetohouse search we had a spike in the number
of reports of smallpox When we didnt search we had
the illusion that there was no disease When we did search we had the illusion
that there was more disease A surveillance system was necessary because what we needed
was early detection early response So we searched and we searched and we found every case
of smallpox in India We had a reward We raised the reward We continued to increase the reward We had a scorecard
that we wrote on every house And as we did that the number of reported cases
in the world dropped to zero And in  we declared the globe
free of smallpox It was the largest campaign
in United Nations history until the Iraq war  people from all over the world  doctors of every race
religion culture and nation who fought side by side
brothers and sisters with each other not against each other in a common cause
to make the world better But smallpox was the fourth disease
that was intended for eradication We failed three other times We failed against malaria
yellow fever and yaws But soon we may see polio eradicated But the key to eradicating polio
is early detection early response This may be the year we eradicate polio That will make it
the second disease in history And David Heymann whos watching
this on the webcast  David keep on going Were close Were down to four countries I feel like Hank Aaron Barry Bonds can replace me any time Lets get another disease off the list
of terrible things to worry about I was just in India working on
the polio program The polio surveillance program
is four million people going door to door That is the surveillance system But we need to have
early detection early response Blindness the same thing The key to discovering blindness
is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness so you can mount the correct response The Seva Foundation
was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme who having climbed the highest mountain tasted the elixir of the success
of eradicating a disease wanted to do it again And over the last  years
Sevas programs in  countries have given back sight
to more than two million blind people Seva got started because we wanted
to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else
was looking at as a public health issue blindness which heretofore had been
thought of only as a clinical disease In  Steve Jobs gave me
that computer which is Apple number  and its still in Kathmandu
and its still working and we ought to go get it and auction
it off and make more money for Seva And we conducted the first Nepal survey
ever done for health and the first nationwide
blindness survey ever done and we had astonishing results Instead of finding out
what we thought was the case  that blindness was caused mostly
by glaucoma and trachoma  we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused
instead by cataract You cant cure or prevent
what you dont know is there In your TED packages
theres a DVD Infinite Vision about Dr V and the Aravind Eye Hospital I hope that you will take a look at it Aravind which started as a Seva project is now the worlds largest
and best eye hospital This year that one hospital
will give back sight to more than  people
in Tamil Nadu India Bird flu I stand here as a representative
of all terrible things  this might be the worst The key to preventing
or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response We will not have a vaccine
or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs
in the next three years WHO stages the progress of a pandemic We are now at stage three
on the pandemic alert stage with just a little bit
of humantohuman transmission but no humantohumantohuman
sustained transmission The moment WHO says
weve moved to category four  this will not be like Katrina The world as we know it will stop Therell be no airplanes flying Would you get in an airplane
with  people you didnt know coughing and sneezing when you knew that some of them
might carry a disease that could kill you for which you had
no antivirals or vaccine I did a study of the top epidemiologists
in the world in October I asked them  these are all fluologists
and specialists in influenza  and I asked them the questions
youd like to ask them What do you think the likelihood
is that therell be a pandemic If it happens how bad
do you think it will be Fifteen percent said they thought
thered be a pandemic within three years But much worse than that  percent said they thought
thered be a pandemic within your children
or your grandchildrens lifetime And they thought
that if there was a pandemic a billion people would get sick As many as  million people would die There would be a global
recession and depression as our justintime inventory system and the tight rubber band
of globalization broke and the cost to our economy
of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone
than merely  million people dying because so many more people
would lose their job and their healthcare benefits that the consequences
are almost unthinkable And its getting worse
because travel is getting so much better Let me show you a simulation
of what a pandemic looks like So we know what were talking about Lets assume for example
that the first case occurs in South Asia It initially goes quite slowly You get two or three discrete locations Then therell be secondary outbreaks
and the disease will spread from country to country so fast
that you wont know what hit you Within three weeks
it will be everywhere in the world Now if we had an undo button
and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started 
if we could find it early and we had early detection
and early response and we could put each one
of those viruses in jail  thats the only way to deal with
something like a pandemic And let me show you why that is We have a joke This is an epidemic curve
and everyone in medicine I think ultimately gets
to know what it is But the joke is an epidemiologist likes to arrive
at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve But you dont get to do that usually You usually arrive right about here What we really want is to arrive
right here so we can stop the epidemic But you cant always do that But theres an organization
that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur and that is called GPHIN its the Global Public Health
Information Network And that simulation that I showed you that you thought
was bird flu  that was SARS And SARS is the pandemic
that did not occur And it didnt occur because GPHIN found
the pandemictobe of SARS three months before WHO actually
announced it and because of that we were able to stop the SARS pandemic And I think we owe
a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St John who I hope is in the audience
some place  over there  whos the founder of GPHIN Hello Ron And TED has flown Ron here
from Ottawa where GPHIN is located because not only
did GPHIN find SARS early but you may have seen last week that Iran announced
that they had bird flu in Iran but GPHIN found the bird flu
in Iran not February   but last September We need an earlywarning system to protect us against the things
that are humanitys worst nightmare And so my TED wish is based on
the common denominator of these experiences Smallpox  early detection
early response Blindness polio 
early detection early response Pandemic bird flu 
early detection early response It is a litany It is so obvious that our only way
of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early
and to kill them before they spread So my TED wish is for you
to help build a global system  an earlywarning system  to protect us against
humanitys worst nightmares And what I thought I would call it
is Early Detection But it should really be called  Total Early Detection
TED What What But in all seriousness because this idea is birthed in TED I would like it to be
a legacy of TED and Id like to call it the International System for Total
Early Disease Detection INSTEDD And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra So instead of a hidden
pandemic of bird flu we find it and immediately contain it Instead of a novel virus
caused by bioterror or bioerror or shift or drift
we find it and we contain it Instead of industrial
accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal we find them and we respond to them Instead of famine
hidden until it is too late we detect it and we respond And instead of a system
which is owned by a government and hidden in the bowels of government lets build an early detection system thats freely available to anyone
in the world in their own language Lets make it transparent
nongovernmental not owned by any single
country or company housed in a neutral country
with redundant backup in a different time zone
and a different continent And lets build it on GPHIN Lets start with GPHIN Lets increase the websites
that they crawl from  to  million Lets increase the languages they crawl from seven to  or more Lets build in outbound
confirmation messages using text messages or SMS
or instant messaging to find out from people
who are within  meters of the rumor that you hear if it is in fact valid And lets add satellite confirmation And well add Gapminders
amazing graphics to the front end And well grow it
as a moral force in the world finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them and sending our response to them so that next year
instead of us meeting here lamenting how many terrible things
there are in the world we will have pulled together used the unique skills
and the magic of this community and be proud that we have done
everything we can to stop pandemics other catastrophes and change
the world beginning right now Chris Anderson An amazing presentation First of all just so
everyone understands youre saying that
by creating web crawlers looking on the Internet for patterns they can detect something suspicious before WHO before anyone else can see it Give an example of how
that could possibly be true Larry Brilliant Youre not mad
about the copyright violation CA No I love it LB Well as Ron St John  I hope youll go and meet him
in the dinner afterwards and talk to him When he started GPHIN  In  there was an outbreak
of bird flu  HN It was in Hong Kong And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong
responded immediately by slaughtering  million
chickens and birds and they stopped
that outbreak in its tracks Immediate detection immediate response Then a number of years went by and there were a lot
of rumors about bird flu Ron and his team in Ottawa
began to crawl the web  only crawling  different websites
mostly periodicals  and they read about
and heard about a concern of a lot of children who had high fever
and symptoms of bird flu They reported this to WHO WHO took a little while taking action because WHO will only receive
a report from a government because its the United Nations But they were able to point
to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising
and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu That turned out to be SARS Thats how the world found out about SARS And because of that
we were able to stop SARS Now whats really important is that
before there was GPHIN  percent of all the worlds
reports of bad things  whether youre talking about famine or youre talking about bird flu
or youre talking about Ebola   percent of all those reports
came from nations The moment these guys in Ottawa  on a budget of  dollars
a year  got cracking  percent of all the reports
in the world came from GPHIN  percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other  nations Now heres whats really interesting after theyd been working
for a couple years what do you think happened
to those nations They felt pretty stupid So they started sending in
their reports early And now their reporting percentage
is down to  percent because other nations
have started to report So can you find diseases
early by crawling the web Of course you can Can you find it even earlier
than GPHIN does now Of course you can You saw that they found SARS
using their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it
using their English web crawler Well theyre only crawling
in seven languages These bad viruses really
dont have any intention of showing up first in English
or Spanish or French So yes I want to take GPHIN
I want to build on it I want to add all the languages
of the world that we possibly can I want to make this open to everybody so that the health officer
in Nairobi or in Patna Bihar will have as much access to it
as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people
who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity and that its accessible to everyone ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

59,Well as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call Hello is that Dominos Pizza I just really want to thank you very much As another famous man Jerry Garcia said What a strange long trip And he should have said What a strange long trip its about to become At this very moment you are viewing my upper half My lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country You can it turns out be in two places at once But still Im sorry I cant be with you in person Ill explain at another time And though Im a rock star I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP players The revolution  this revolution  is much bigger than that I hope I believe What turns me on about the digital age what excites me personally is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing You see it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song you needed a studio and a producer Now you need a laptop If you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget Now you need a camera that fits in your palm and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints And that really really excites me Im excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints Political economic psychological whatever The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged And thats actually what Id like to talk about today First though I should probably explain why and how I got to this place Its a journey that started  years ago You may remember that song We Are the World or Do They Know Its Christmas Band Aid Live Aid Another very tall grizzled rock star my friend Sir Bob Geldof issued a challenge to feed the world It was a great moment and it utterly changed my life That summer my wife Ali and myself went to Ethiopia We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on We lived in Ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage The children had a name for me They called me The girl with the beard Dont ask Anyway we found Africa to be a magical place Big skies big hearts big shining continent Beautiful royal people Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back Ethiopia didnt just blow my mind it opened my mind Anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said Would you take my son with you He knew in Ireland that his son would live and that in Ethiopia his son would die It was the middle of that awful famine Well I turned him down And it was a funny kind of sick feeling but I turned him down And its a feeling I cant ever quite forget And in that moment I started this journey In that moment I became the worst thing of all I became a rock star with a cause Laughter Except this isnt the cause is it Sixandahalf thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS  a preventable treatable disease  for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy Thats not a cause Thats an emergency  million AIDS orphans in Africa  million by the end of the decade Thats not a cause Thats an emergency Today every day  more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education Thats not a cause Thats an emergency So what were talking about here is human rights The right to live like a human The right to live period And what were facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality The next thing Id like to be clear about is what this problem is and what this problem isnt Because this is not all about charity This is about justice Really This is not about charity This is about justice Thats right And thats too bad because were very good at charity Americans like Irish people are good at it Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford We like to give and we give a lot Look at the response to the tsunami  its inspiring But justice is a tougher standard than charity You see Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice It makes a farce of our idea of equality It mocks our pieties It doubts our concern It questions our commitment Because there is no way we can look at whats happening in Africa and if were honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else As you heard in the film anywhere else not here Not here not in America not in Europe In fact a head of state that youre all familiar with admitted this to me And its really true There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa Africa is a continent in flames And deep down if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us we would all do more to put the fire out Were standing around with watering cans when what we really need is the fire brigade You see its not as dramatic as the tsunami Its crazy really when you think about it Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert Funny that Anyway I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room Sixandahalf thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africas crisis but the fact that its not on the nightly news that we in Europe or you in America are not treating it like an emergency  I want to argue with you tonight that thats our crisis I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror it could be soon Every week religious extremists take another African village Theyre attempting to bring order to chaos Well why arent we Poverty breeds despair We know this Despair breeds violence We know this In turbulent times isnt it cheaper and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty And I didnt say that Colin Powell said that Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen Theres an opportunity here and its real Its not spin Its not wishful thinking The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to redescribe ourselves to the world We will not only transform other peoples lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us And that might be smart in these nervous dangerous times Dont you think that on a purely commercial level that antiretroviral drugs are great advertisements for Western ingenuity and technology Doesnt compassion look well on us And lets cut the crap for a second In certain quarters of the world brand EU brand USA is not at its shiniest The neon sign is fizzing and cracking Someones put a brick through the window The regional branch managers are getting nervous Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized Our values do we have any Our credibility These things are under attack around the world Brand USA could use some polishing And I say that as a fan you know As a person who buys the products But think about it More antiretrovirals make sense But thats just the easy part or ought to be But equality for Africa  thats a big expensive idea You see the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference What on earth can we all do about this Well much more than we think We cant fix every problem but the ones we can I want to argue we must And because we can we must This is the straight truth the righteous truth It is not a theory The fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye look across the ocean to Africa and say this and mean it we do not have to stand for this A whole continent written off  we do not have to stand for this And let me say this without a trace of irony  before I back it up to a bunch of exhippies Forget the s We can change the world I cant you cant as individuals but we can change the world I really believe that the people in this room Look at the Gates Foundation Theyve done incredible stuff unbelievable stuff But working together we can actually change the world We can turn the inevitable outcomes and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us when youre up close Im sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in HaightAshbury in the s But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier headier days Ideas that you gestated in your youth This is what excites me This room was born for this moment is really what I want to say to you tonight Most of you started out wanting to change the world didnt you Most of you did the digital world Well now actually because of you it is possible to change the physical world Its a fact Economists confirm it and they know much more than I do So why then are we not pumping our fists into the air Probably because when we admit we can do something about it weve got to do something about it It is a pain in the arse This equality business is actually a pain in the arse But for the first time in history we have the technology we have the knowhow we have the cash we have the lifesaving drugs Do we have the will I hope this is obvious but Im not a hippie And Im not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling I do not have flowers in my hair Actually I come from punk rock The Clash wore big army boots not sandals But I know toughness when I see it And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast there was muscle to the movement that started out here You see idealism detached from action is just a dream But idealism allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit is very exciting Its very real Its very strong And its very present in a crowd like you Last year at DATA this organization I helped set up we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty Were calling it the ONE Campaign Its based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world Well we feel that now is the time to prove were right There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself We believe this is one We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth Momentum has been building Lurching a little but its building This year is a test for us all especially the leaders of the G nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching I have been of late disappointed with the Bush Administration They started out with such promise on Africa They made some really great promises and actually have fulfilled a lot of them But some of them they havent They dont feel the push from the ground is the truth But my disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people and I hear their worries about the deficit and the fiscal well being of their country I understand that But theres much more push from the ground than youd think if we got organized What I try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it Putting it in the crassest possible terms the investment reaps huge returns Not only in lives saved but in goodwill stability and security that well gain So this is what I hope that you will do if I could be so bold and not have it deducted from my number of wishes What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa by America and by the world Give them permission if you like to spend their political capital and your financial capital your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people Thats really what I would like you to do Because we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity And you at this conference are in a unique position Some of the technologies weve been talking about you invented them or at least revolutionized the way that theyre used Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital and pushed the boundaries And wed like you to give us that energy Give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing As I say therere two things on the line here Theres the continent Africa But theres also our sense of ourselves People are starting to figure this out Movements are springing up Artists politicians pop stars priests CEOs NGOs mothers unions student unions A lot of people are getting together and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier the ONE Campaign I think they just have one idea in their mind which is where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world History like God is watching what we do When the history books get written I think our age will be remembered for three things Really its just three things this whole age will be remembered for The digital revolution yes The war against terror yes And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa Some say we cant afford to I say we cant afford not to Thank you thank you very much Okay my three wishes The ones that TED has offered to grant You see if this is true and I believe it is that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter this should be a piece of piss I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes Most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral This business it gets to be addictive you know what I mean when somebody else is picking up the tab Anyway heres number one I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa That is my first wish I believe its possible A few minutes ago I talked about all the citizens campaigns that are springing up You know theres lots out there And with this one campaign as our umbrella my organization DATA and other groups have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm thats out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America We know theres more than enough energy to power this movement We just need your help in making it happen We want all of you here church America corporate America Microsoft America Apple America Coke America Pepsi America nerd America noisy America We cant afford to be cool and sit this one out I do believe if we build a movement thats one million Americans strong were not going to be denied We will have the ear of Congress Well be the first page in Condi Rices briefing book and right into the Oval Office If theres one million Americans  and I really know this  who are ready to make phone calls who are ready to be on email I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history literally for the continent of Africa Anyway so Id like your help in getting that signed up I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this but theres lots of you wed like to talk to Right my second wish number two I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day Thats one billion media hits Could be on Google could be on AOL Steve Case Larry Sergey  theyve done a lot already It could be NBC It could be ABC Actually were talking to ABC today about the Oscars We have a film produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media But you know we want we need some airtime for our ideas We need to get the math we need to get the statistics out to the American people I really believe that old Truman line that if you give the American people the facts theyll do the right thing And the other thing thats important is that this is not Sally Struthers This has to be described as an adventure not a burden Video One by one they step forward a nurse a teacher a homemaker and lives are saved The problem is enormous Every three seconds one person dies Another three seconds one more The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa Asia even America that aid groups just as they did for the tsunami are uniting as one acting as one We can beat extreme poverty starvation AIDS But we need your help One more person letter voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people Please join us by working together Americans have an unprecedented opportunity We can make history We can start to make poverty history One by one by one Please visit ONE at this address Were not asking for your money Were asking for your voice Bono All right I wish for TED to truly show the power of information its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives by connecting every hospital health clinic and school in one African country And I would like it to be Ethiopia I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia every health clinic every hospital  we can connect to the Internet That is my wish my third wish I think its possible I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that And that would be a mindblowing wish to come true Ive been to Ethiopia as I said earlier Its actually where it all started for me The idea that the Internet which changed all of our lives can transform a country  and a continent that has hardly made it to analog let alone digital  blows my mind But it didnt start out that way The first longdistance line from Boston to New York was used in  on the phone It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare which is  kilometers away Since then not that much has changed The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years But wireless technology wasnt dreamt up then Anyway Im Irish and as you can see I know how important talking is Communication is very important for Ethiopia  will transform the country Nurses getting better training pharmacists being able to order supplies doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine Its a very very good idea to get them wired And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference Thank you very much once again ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

60,So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl If you say a word often enough it becomes you And having grown up in a segregated city Baltimore Maryland I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder  thank God for technology  to interview people thinking that if I walked in their words  which is also why I dont wear shoes when I perform  if I walked in their words that I could sort of absorb America I was also inspired by Walt Whitman who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him So these four characters are going to be from that work that Ive been doing for many years now and well over I dont know a couple of thousand people Ive interviewed Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel that old radio man So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history You know he was born in  the year the Titanic sank greatest ship every built Hits the tip of an iceberg and bam it went down It went down and I came up Wow some century So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history Defining moment in American history I dont think theres one you cant say Hiroshima thats a big one  I cant think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment The gradual slippage  slippage is the word used by the people in Watergate moral slippage  its a gradual kind of thing combination of things You see we also have the technology I say less and less the human touch Oh let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit The Atlanta airport is a modern airport and they should leave the gate there These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination And these trains are smooth and theyre quiet and theyre efficient And theres a voice on the train you know the voice was a human voice You see in the old days we had robots robots imitated humans Now we have humans imitating robots So we got this voice on this train Concourse One Omaha Lincoln Concourse Two Dallas Fort Worth Same voice Just as a train is about to go a young couple rush in and theyre just about to close the pneumatic doors And that voice without losing a beat says Because of late entry were delayed  seconds Just then everybodys looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couples going like this you know shrinking Well Id happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding  I do that to steel my nerves  and so I imitate a train call holding my hand on my  George Orwell your time has come you see Well some of you are laughing Everybody laughs when I say that but not on this train Silence And so suddenly theyre looking at me So here I am with the couple the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up you know Just then I see a baby a little baby in the lap of a mother I know its Hispanic because shes speaking Spanish to her companion So Im going to talk to the baby So I say to the baby holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be  proof I say to the baby Sir or Madam what is your considered opinion of the human species And the baby looks you know the way babies look at you clearly starts laughing starts busting out with this crazy little laugh I say Thank God for a human reaction we havent lost yet But you see the human touch you see its disappearing You know you see youve got to question the official truth You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain  you know we honor Mark Twain but we dont read him We read Huck Finn of course we read Huck Finn of course I mean Huck of course was tremendous Remember that great scene on the raft remember what Huck did You see heres Huck hes an illiterate kid hes had no schooling but theres something in him And the official truth the truth was the law was that a black man was a property was a thing you see And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim a slave see And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them and Huck says Ooh oh my God ooh ooh  that woman that woman never did anybody any harm Ooh hes going to steal hes going to steal hes going to do a terrible thing Just then two slavers caught up guys chasing slaves looking for Jim Anybody up on that raft with you Huck says Yeah Is he black or white White And they go off And Huck said Oh my God oh my God I lied I lied ooh I did a terrible thing did a terrible thing  why do I feel so good But its the goodness of Huck that stuff that Hucks been made of you see all been buried its all been buried So the human touch you see its disappearing So you ask about a defining moment  aint no defining moment in American history for me Its an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now where trivia becomes news And more and more less and less awareness of the pain of the other Huh You know I dont know if you could use this or not but I was quoting Wright Morris a writer from Nebraska who says Were more and more into communications and less and less into communication Okay kids I got to scram got to go see my cardiologist And thats Studs Terkel So talk about risk taking Im going to do somebody that nobody likes You know most actors want to do characters that are likeable  well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this I like to inspire people But since this was called risk taking Im doing somebody who I never do because shes so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in And Im doing her because I think we think of risk at a conference like this as a good thing But there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature What is nature Maxine Greene whos a wonderful philosopher whos as old as Studs and was the head of a philosophy  great big philosophy kind of an organization  I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesnt know that she still wants to know And she said Well personally I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university And I still feel as though Ive got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though Ive outlived most of them And she said And then intellectually I dont know enough about the negative imagination And September th certainly taught us that thats a whole area we dont investigate So this piece is about a negative imagination It raises questions about what nature is what Mother Nature is and about what a risk can be And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women Everything I do is word for word off a tape And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems and this is called A Mirror to Her Mouth And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins I began to learn how to cover it up because I didnt want nobody to know that this was happening in my home I want everybody to think we were a normal family I mean we had all the materialistic things but that didnt make my children pain any less that didnt make their fears subside I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises I didnt had no more excuses And he beat me too But that didnt change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare And I failed them dramatically because I allowed it to go on and on and on But the night that Myesha got killed  and the intensity just grew and grew and grew until one night we came home from getting drugs and he got angry with Myesha and he started beating her and he put her in a bathtub Oh he would use a belt He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that Myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other  that would be his reason Im just talking about the particular night that she died And so he put her in the bathtub and I was in the bedroom with the baby And four months before this happened four months before Myesha died I thought I could really fix this man So I had a baby by him  insane  thinking that if I gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone And it didnt work didnt work And I ended up with three children Houston Myesha and Dominic who was four months old when I came to jail And I was in the bedroom Like I said he had her in the bathroom and he  he  every time he hit her she would fall And she would hit her head on the tub It happened continuously repeatedly I could hear it but I dared not to move I didnt move I didnt even go and see what was happening I just sat there and listened And then he put her in the hallway He told her just set there And so she set there for about four or five hours And then he told her get up And when she got up she says she couldnt see Her face was bruised She had a black eye All around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of its own size I told him Let her go to sleep He let her go to sleep The next morning she was dead He went in to check on her for school and he got very excited He says She wont breathe I knew immediately that she was dead I didnt even want to accept the fact that she was dead so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth  there was no thing nothing coming out of her mouth He said he said he said We cant we cant let nobody find out about this He say Youve got to help me I agree I agree I mean Ive been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had like lost her that she was missing We told a security guard that she was missing though she wasnt missing And we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her And then we got the baby and my other child and we drove out to like I I was so petrified and so numb all I could look was in the rearview mirror And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway My own child I let that happen to So thats an investigation of the negative imagination When I started this project called On the Road A Search For an American Character with my tape recorder I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects  bull riders cowboys pig farmers drum majorettes  but I sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show about a race riot And so I went to both  two race riots one of which was the Los Angeles riot And this next piece is from that Because this is what I would say Ive learned the most about race relations from this piece Its a kind of an aria I would say and in many tapes that I have Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King It was captured on videotape  technology  and it was played all over the world Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail They did not so there were riots And what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by George Bush Sr And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent I was at that trial And I mean the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way So there was a community that didnt  the KoreanAmericans whose stores had been burned to the ground And so this woman Mrs YoungSoon Han I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race And she asks also a question that Studs talks about this notion of the official truth to question the official truth So what shes questioning here shes taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society And this is called Swallowing the Bitterness I used to believe America was the best I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie I never saw any poor man any black Until  I used to believe America was the best  I still do I dont deny that because I am a victim But at the end of  when we were in such turmoil and having all the financial problems and all the mental problems I began to really realize that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing Why Why do we have to be left out We didnt qualify for medical treatment no food stamp no GR no welfare anything Many AfricanAmericans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive We didnt get any because we have a car and a house And we are high taxpayer Where do I find justice OK OK OK OK Many AfricanAmericans probably think that they won by the trial I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the day they were having a party they celebrated all of South Central all the churches And they say Well finally justice has been done in this society Well what about victims rights They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants They have a lot of respect as I do for Dr Martin King He is the only model for black community I dont care Jesse Jackson He is the model of nonviolence nonviolence  and they would all like to be in his spirit But what about  They destroyed innocent people And I wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way I was swallowing the bitterness sitting here alone and watching them They became so hilarious but I was happy for them I was glad for them At least they got something back OK Lets just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them They fought for their rights for over two centuries and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities Hispanic Asian we would suffer more in the mainstream Thats why I understand thats why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict But I wish that I wish that I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment I wish that I could live together with black people But after the riot its too much difference The fire is still there How do you say it Unclear Igniting igniting igniting fire Igniting fire Its still there it can burst out anytime Mrs YoungSoon Han The other reason that I dont wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody elses shoes And I told you that in  you know I didnt give you the year but in  I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and I got sidetracked on race relations Finally I did find a bull rider two years ago And Ive been going to the rodeos with him and weve bonded And hes the lead in an oped I did about the Republican Convention Hes a Republican  I wont say anything about my party affiliation but anyway  so this is my dear dear Brent Williams and this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do I think theres a real lesson in this And this is called Toughness Well Im an optimist I mean basically Im an optimist I mean you know I mean its like my wife Jolene her familys always saying you know you ever think hes just a born loser It seems like he has so much bad luck you know But then when that bull stepped on my kidney you know I didnt lose my kidney  I could have lost my kidney I kept my kidney so I dont think Im a born loser I think thats good luck And I mean funny things like this happen I was in a doctors office last CAT scan and there was a Readers Digest October  It was like seven ways to get lucky And it says if you want to get lucky you know youve got to be around positive people I mean like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me shes like Shes just talking shes just being nice to you Shes not going to do that And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet She said Look who she is Youre not even going to be able to answer her questions And she was saying youre going to make me look like an idiot because Ive never been to college and I wouldnt be talking professional or anything I said Well look the woman talked to me for four hours You know if I wasnt talking  you know like you know she wanted me to talk I dont think she would even come out here Confidence Well I think I ride more out of determination than confidence I mean confidence is like you know youve been on that bull before you know you can ride him I mean confidence is kind of like being cocky but in a good way But determination you know its like just you know Fuck the form get the horn Thats Tuff Hedeman in the movie  Seconds I mean like Pat OMealey always said when I was a boy he say You know you got more try than any kid I ever seen And try and determination is the same thing Determination is like youre going to hang on that bull even if youre riding upside down Determinations like youre going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt Freedom It would have to be the rodeo Beauty I dont think I know what beauty is Well you know I guess thatd have to be the rodeo too I mean look how we are the roughy family palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me Its like you know racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas We ride together we you know we we eat together and we sleep together I mean I cant even imagine what its going to be like the last day I rodeo I mean Ill be alright I mean I have my ranch and everything but I actually dont even want to think the day that comes I mean I guess it just be like  I guess it be like the day my brother died Toughness Well we was in West Jordan Utah and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a  you know busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night so I didnt want them to put me under anesthesia or whatever you call it And so they sewed my face up And then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didnt because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain But the good thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out I could breathe and I hadnt been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo Thank you

61,If you havent ordered yet I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine So sorry  it just feels like I should be doing standup up here because of the setting No what I want to do is take you back to  in London for the next few minutes and tell the story  in brief  of this outbreak which in many ways I think helped create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today This period in  in the middle part of the th century in Londons history is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons But I think the most important one is that London was this city of  million people and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point But it was also the largest city that had ever been built And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living this scale of living that we you know now call metropolitan living And it was in many ways at this point in the mids a complete disaster They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure So people for instance just to gross you out for a second had cesspools of human waste in their basement Like a foot to two feet deep And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away and of course it never really would go away And all of this stuff basically had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in It was an amazingly smelly city Not just because of the cesspools but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people Not just the horses but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street So you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years And cholera was really the great killer of this period It arrived in London in  and every four or five years another epidemic would take   people in London and throughout the UK And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem We had to get rid of the smell And so in fact they concocted a couple of early you know founding publichealth interventions in the system of the city one of which was called the Nuisances Act which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river Because if we get it out of the streets itll smell much better and  oh right we drink from the river So what ended up happening actually is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because as we now know cholera is actually in the water Its a waterborne disease not something thats in the air Its not something you smell or inhale its something you ingest And so one of the founding moments of public health in the th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing So this was the state of London in  and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people it was a very talented classic th century multidisciplinarian named John Snow who was a local doctor in Soho in London who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was in fact a waterborne disease and had basically convinced nobody of this The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say And hed made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies but nothing had really stuck And part of  whats so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways its a great case study in how cultural change happens how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored And then on one day August th of  a young child a fivemonthold girl whose first name we dont know we know her only as Baby Lewis somehow contracted cholera came down with cholera at  Broad Street You cant really see it in this map but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book Its in the middle of Soho in this working class neighborhood this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool that they still continue to have despite the Nuisances Act bordered on an extremely popular water pump local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later Literally  percent of the neighborhood died in seven days and much more would have died if people hadnt fled after the initial outbreak kicked in So it was this incredibly terrifying event You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of  hours of cholera alone in their oneroom apartments in their little flats Just an extraordinary terrifying scene Snow lived near there heard about the outbreak and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that in fact the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source One single thing that everybody was going to because it didnt have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect And so he went right in there and started interviewing people He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure whos kind of the other protagonist of the book  this guy Henry Whitehead who was a local minister who was not at all a man of science but was incredibly socially connected he knew everybody in the neighborhood And he managed to track down Whitehead did many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump or who hadnt drunk water from the pump And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick People who hadnt drunk from the pump were not getting sick And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods people who hadnt you know percentages of people who hadnt but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see Something that would take in a sense a higherlevel view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood And so he created this map which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address And you can see in this map the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about  people dead And the map is actually a little bit bigger As you get further and further away from the pump the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance And so with the help of this map and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did eventually actually the authorities slowly started to come around It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story but by  when the next big cholera outbreak came to London the authorities had been convinced  in part because of this story in part because of this map  that in fact the water was the problem And they had already started building the sewers in London and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since So part of this story I think  well its a terrifying story its a very dark story and its a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world Its also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic which is to say that its possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead if we listen to the locals who understand whats going on in these kinds of situations And what it ended up doing is making the idea of largescale metropolitan living a sustainable one When people were looking at  percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days there was a widespread consensus that this couldnt go on that people werent meant to live in cities of  million people But because of what Snow did because of this map because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map we now take for granted that cities have  million people cities like this one are in fact sustainable things We dont worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that you know Rome did and be  percent of its size in  years or  years And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map Its a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life the life that were enjoying here today Thank you very much ,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

62,What Id like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world Im not going to talk about The Skeptical Environmentalist  probably thats also a good choice But I am going talk about what are the big problems in the world And I must say before I go on I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because Im actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that So get out your pen and paper Bottom line is there is a lot of problems out there in the world Im just going to list some of them There are  million people starving Theres a billion people without clean drinking water Two billion people without sanitation There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS The lists go on and on Theres two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change  so on There are many many problems out there In an ideal world we would solve them all but we dont We dont actually solve all problems And if we do not the question I think we need to ask ourselves  and thats why its on the economy session  is to say if we dont do all things we really have to start asking ourselves which ones should we solve first And thats the question Id like to ask you If we had say  billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it We identified  of the biggest challenges in the world and I will just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflicts education financial instability governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger population migration sanitation and water and subsidies and trade barriers We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world The obvious question would be to ask what do you think are the biggest things Where should we start on solving these problems But thats a wrong problem to ask That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January But of course theres a problem in asking people to focus on problems Because we cant solve problems Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die But we dont have a technology to solve that right So the point is not to prioritize problems but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems And that would be  of course that gets a little more complicated To climate change that would be like Kyoto To communicable diseases it might be health clinics or mosquito nets To conflicts it would be UNs peacekeeping forces and so on The point that I would like to ask you to try to do is just in  seconds  and I know this is in a sense an impossible task  write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities And also  and thats of course where economics gets evil  to put down what are the things we should not do first What should be at the bottom of the list Please just take  seconds perhaps talk to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the worlds biggest issues The amazing part of this process  and of course I mean I would love to  I only have  minutes Ive already given you quite a substantial amount of my time right Id love to go into and get you to think about this process and thats actually what we did And I also strongly encourage you and Im sure well also have these discussions afterwards to think about how do we actually prioritize Of course you have to ask yourself why on Earth was such a list never done before And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable Nobody wants to do this Of course every organization would love to be on the top of such a list But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list And since there are many more notnumberone spots on the list than there is number ones it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list Weve had the UN for almost  years yet weve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world and said which of them should we do first So it doesnt mean that we are not prioritizing  any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly  and thats unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization and went in and talked about it So what Im proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when weve had a menu of choices There are many many things we can do out there but weve not had the prices nor the sizes We have not had an idea Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is You know you have a pizza youve no idea what the price is It could be at one dollar it could be  dollars It could be a familysize pizza it could be a very individualsize pizza right Wed like to know these things And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do  to try to put prices on these issues And so basically this has been the Copenhagen Consensus process We got  of the worlds best economists three in each area So we have three of worlds top economists write about climate change What can we do What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that Likewise in communicable diseases Three of the worlds top experts saying what can we do What would be the price What should we do about it and what will be the outcome And so on Then we had some of the worlds top economists eight of the worlds top economists including three Nobel Laureates meet in Copenhagen in May  We called them the dream team The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics That works very well in Europe but it doesnt really work over here And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list And then you ask why economists And of course Im very happy you asked that question  Laughter  because thats a very good question The point is of course if you want to know about malaria you ask a malaria expert If you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first you cant ask either of them because thats not what they do That is what economists do They prioritize They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards So this is the list and this is the one Id like to share with you Of course you can also see it on the website and well also talk about it more Im sure as the day goes on They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects  basically projects where if you invest a dollar you get less than a dollar back Then theres fair projects good projects and very good projects And of course its the very good projects we should start doing Im going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects These were the bad projects As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change This offends a lot of people and thats probably one of the things where people will say I shouldnt come back either And Id like to talk about that because thats really curious Why is it it came up And Ill actually also try to get back to this because its probably one of the things that well disagree with on the list that you wrote down The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto  or doing something more than Kyoto  is a bad deal is simply because its very inefficient Its not saying that global warming is not happening Its not saying that its not a big problem But its saying that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost What they basically show us the average of all macroeconomic models is that Kyoto if everyone agreed would cost about  billion dollars a year Thats a substantial amount of money Thats two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year Yet it would do very little good All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in  So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in  can wait until  Which is a little good but not very much good So the idea here really is to say well weve spent a lot of money doing a little good And just to give you a sense of reference the UN actually estimate that for half that amount for about  billion dollars a year we could solve all major basic problems in the world We could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet So we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good And that is really why it becomes a bad project Its not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldnt want to do it But its to say when we dont its just simply not our first priority The fair projects  notice Im not going to comment on all these  but communicable diseases scale of basic health services  just made it simply because yes scale of basic health services is a great thing It would do a lot of good but its also very very costly Again what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation If you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects came in Again sanitation and water is incredibly important but it also costs a lot of infrastructure So Id like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world The fourth best problem is malaria  dealing with malaria The incidence of malaria is about a couple of million people get infected every year It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations If we invested about  billion dollars over the next four years we could bring that incidence down to half We could avoid about  people dying but perhaps more importantly we could avoid about a million people getting infected every year We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with  of course in the long run also to deal with global warming This third best one was free trade Basically the model showed that if we could get free trade and especially cut subsidies in the US and Europe we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about  billion dollars a year half of which would accrue to the Third World Again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty very radically fast in about two to five years That would be the third best thing we could do The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition Not just malnutrition in general but theres a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely the lack of micronutrients Basically about half of the worlds population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin A If we invest about  billion dollars we could make a severe inroad into that problem That would be the second best investment that we could do And the very best project would be to focus on HIVAIDS Basically if we invest  billion dollars over the next eight years we could avoid  new million cases of HIVAIDS Again what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIVAIDS One is treatment the other one is prevention And again in an ideal world we would do both But in a world where we dont do either or dont do it very well we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first And treatment is much much more expensive than prevention So basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention Basically for the amount of money that we spend we can do X amount of good in treatment and  times as much good in prevention So again what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment at first rate What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities Id like to have you look at your priority list and say did you get it right Or did you get close to what we came up with here Well of course one of the things is climate change again I find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should do that We should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because its such a big problem But of course we dont do all problems There are many problems out there in the world And what I want to make sure of is if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good And I think actually  Thomas Schelling one of the participants in the dream team he put it very very well One of things that people forget is that in  years when were talking about most of the climate change impacts will be people will be much much richer Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the UN estimate that the average person in the developing world in  will be about as rich as we are today Much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are And of course well be even richer than that But the point is to say when we talk about saving people or helping people in Bangladesh in  were not talking about a poor Bangladeshi Were actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy And so the real point of course is to say do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little  years from now a fairly rich Dutch guy Or do we want to help real poor people right now in Bangladesh who really need the help and whom we can help very very cheaply Or as Schelling put it imagine if you were a rich  as you will be  a rich Chinese a rich Bolivian a rich Congolese in  thinking back on  and saying How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather whom they could have helped so much more and who needed the help so much more So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight Even if it doesnt accord to the typical way we see this problem Of course thats mainly because climate change has good pictures We have you know The Day After Tomorrow  it looks great right Its a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it right but dont expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something Laughter It just doesnt make for as much of a movie So in many ways I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems To make sure that we realize its not about making us feel good Its not about making things that have the most media attention but its about making places where we can actually do the most good The other objections I think that are important to say is that Im somehow  or we are somehow  positing a false choice Of course we should do all things in an ideal world  I would certainly agree I think we should do all things but we dont In  the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did right now than in  on the developing world Since then our aid has halved So it doesnt look like were actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems Likewise people are also saying but what about the Iraq war You know we spend  billion dollars  why dont we spend that on doing good in the world Im all for that If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that thats fine But the point of course is still to say if you get another  billion dollars we still want to spend that in the best possible way dont we So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities I should just mention briefly is this really the right list that we got out You know when you ask the worlds best economists you inevitably end up asking old white American men And theyre not necessarily you know great ways of looking at the entire world So we actually invited  young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university and they spoke English The majority of them were first from developing countries They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly did to come up with their own lists And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar  with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom Weve done this many other times Theres been many other seminars and university students and different things They all come out with very much the same list And that gives me great hope really in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities and saying what is the important thing in the world Of course in an ideal world again wed love to do everything But if we dont do it then we can start thinking about where should we start I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process We did it in  and we hope to assemble many more people getting much better information for   Map out the right path for the world  but also to start thinking about political triage To start thinking about saying Lets do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost not the things that we dont know how to do but lets do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good at very low cost right now At the end of the day you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these but we have to be honest and frank about saying if theres some things we do there are other things we dont do If we worry too much about some things we end by not worrying about other things So I hope this will help us make better priorities and think about how we better work for the world Thank you ,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

63,"What Im going to do in the spirit of collaborative creativity is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made but do them  this is called creative collaboration its actually called borrowing  but do it through a particular perspective and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about Let me just ask you to start with this simple question who invented the mountain bike Because traditional economic theory would say well the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big RampD lab where they were thinking up new projects and it came out of there It didnt come from there Another answer might be well it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage who working away on different kinds of bikes comes up with a bike out of thin air It didnt come from there The mountain bike came from users came from young users particularly a group in Northern California who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode or your big brother and theyre very glamorous But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode which sort of had big handlebars like that and they were too heavy So they got the frames from these big bikes put them together with the gears from the racing bikes got the brakes from motorcycles and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients And for the first I dont know three to five years of their life mountain bikes were known as clunkers And they were just made in a community of bikers mainly in Northern California And then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business start selling them to other people and gradually another company emerged out of that Marin and it probably was I dont know  maybe even  years before the big bike companies realized there was a market Thirty years later mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for  percent of bike sales in America Thats  billion dollars This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldnt see the need the opportunity they didnt have the incentive to innovate The one thing I think I disagree with about Yochais presentation is when he said the Internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive Its when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate proam consumers  who are knowledgeable theyve got the incentive to innovate theyve got the tools they want to  that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration And out of that you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about which is our new kinds of organization or a better way to put it how do we organize ourselves without organizations Thats now possible you dont need an organization to be organized to achieve large and complex tasks like innovating new software programs So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about The traditional view still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity  in organizations in government  is that creativity is about special people wear baseball caps the wrong way round come to conferences like this in special places elite universities RampD labs in the forests water maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors you know bean bags maybe the odd tablefootball table Special people special places think up special ideas then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers who are passive They can say yes or no to the invention Thats the idea of creativity Whats the policy recommendation out of that if youre in government or youre running a large company More special people more special places Build creative clusters in cities create more RampD parks so on and so forth Expand the pipeline down to the consumers Well this view I think is increasingly wrong I think its always been wrong because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative and its probably been largely interactive But its increasingly wrong and one of the reasons its wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline The ideas are coming back from the consumers and theyre often ahead of the producers Why is that Well one issue is that radical innovation when youve got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest And when you get a radical innovation its often very uncertain how it can be applied The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty The very first landline telephones the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS they had no idea what it was for it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use So the more radical the innovation the more the uncertainty the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for All of our patents our entire approach to patents and invention is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for we can say what its for More and more the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance It will be worked out in use in collaboration with users We like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative like Wikipedia it develops over a long period of time The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big disruptive innovations If you want to find the big new ideas its often difficult to find them in mainstream markets in big organizations And just look inside large organizations and youll see why that is so So youre in a big corporation Youre obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder Do you go into your board and say Look Ive got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market with consumers weve never dealt with before and Im not sure its going to have a big payoff but it could be really really big in the future No what you do is you go in and you say Ive got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years Big corporations have an inbuilt tendency to reinforce past success Theyve got so much sunk in it that its very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets Emerging new markets then are the breeding grounds for passionate users Best example who in the music industry  years ago would have said Yes lets invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to That sounds like a winner well go with it Laughter So what happens Rap music is created by the users They do it on their own tapes with their own recording equipment they distribute it themselves  years later rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture  would never have come from the big companies Had to start  this is the third point  with these proams This is the phrase that Ive used in some stuff which Ive done with a think tank in London called Demos where weve been looking at these people who are amateurs  ie they do it for the love of it  but they want to do it to very high standards And across a whole range of fields  from software astronomy natural sciences vast areas of leisure and culture like kitesurfing so on and so forth  you find people who want to do things because they love it but they want to do these things to very high standards They work at their leisure if you like They take their leisure very seriously they acquire skills they invest time they use technology thats getting cheaper  its not just the Internet cameras design technology leisure technology surfboards so on and so forth Largely through globalization a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper More knowledgeable consumers more educated more able to connect with one another more able to do things together Consumption in that sense is an expression of their productive potential Why we found people were interested in this is that at work they dont feel very expressed They dont feel as if theyre doing something that really matters to them so they pick up these kinds of activities This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life Take astronomy as an example which Yochai has already mentioned Twenty years ago  years ago only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space And theres a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank and when I was a kid it was amazing because the moon shots would take off and this thing would move on rails 

And it was huge  it was absolutely enormous Now six amateur astronomers working with the Internet with Dobsonian digital telescopes  which are pretty much open source  with some light sensors developed over the last  years the Internet  they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do  years ago So here in astronomy you have this vast explosion of new productive resources The users can be producers What does this mean then for our organizational landscape Well just imagine a world for the moment divided into two camps Over here youve got the old traditional corporate model special people special places patent it push it down the pipeline to largely waiting passive consumers Over here lets imagine weve got Wikipedia Linux and beyond  open source This is open this is closed This is new this is traditional Well the first thing you can say I think with certainty is what Yochai has said already  is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding because theyre threatened by them And so the debates about copyright digital rights so on and so forth  these are all about trying to stifle in my view these kinds of organizations What were seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright Meant to be a way to incentivize invention meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place Let me just give you two examples The first is imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying Ive got a fantastic idea Ive invented this brilliant new program that is much much better than Microsoft Outlook Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft with Microsoft Outlook No one That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come  will only come  from an opensource kind of project So there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for opensource and consumerdriven innovation because its one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly Therell be huge professional arguments as well Because the professionals over here in these closed organizations  they might be academics they might be programmers they might be doctors they might be journalists  my former profession  say No no  you cant trust these people over here When I started in journalism  Financial Times  years ago  it was very very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper And youd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article Usually they were reading the share prices and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor or something like that and you know For heavens sake what are they doing Theyre not reading my brilliant article And we allowed users readers two places where they could contribute to the paper the letters page where they could write a letter in and we would condescend to them cut it in half and print it three days later Or the oped page where if they knew the editor  had been to school with him slept with his wife  they could write an article for the oped page Those were the two places Shock horror now the readers want to be writers and publishers Thats not their role theyre supposed to read what we write But they dont want to be journalists The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists they dont want to be journalists they just want to have a voice They want to as Jimmy said they want to have a dialogue a conversation They want to be part of that flow of information Whats happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding So theres going to be a tremendous struggle But also theres going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed What youll see I think is two things that are critical and these I think are two challenges for the open movement The first is can we really survive on volunteers If this is so critical do we not need it funded organized supported in much more structured ways I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea but can we really organize that just on volunteers What kind of changes do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible Whats the role of the BBC for instance in that world What should be the role of public policy And finally what I think you will see is the intelligent closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction So its not going to be a contest between two camps but in between them youll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy New organizational models coming about mixing closed and open in tricky ways It wont be so clearcut it wont be Microsoft versus Linux  therell be all sorts of things in between And those organizational models it turns out are incredibly powerful and the people who can understand them will be very very successful Let me just give you one final example of what that means I was in Shanghai in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago  one of the  skyscrapers theyve built in Shanghai in the last  years And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in  Didnt go into the Internet kept his money decided to go into computer games He runs a company called Shanda which is the largest computer games company in China Nine thousand servers all over China has  million subscribers At any one time there are four million people playing one of his games How many people does he employ to service that population  people Well how can he service  million people from  employees Because basically he doesnt service them He gives them a platform he gives them some rules he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation he orchestrates the action But actually a lot of the content is created by the users themselves And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really really powerful The best measure of that so you go into one of his games you create a character that you develop in the course of the game If for some reason your credit card bounces or theres some other problem you lose your character Youve got two options One option you can create a new character right from scratch but with none of the history of your player That costs about  dollars Or you can get on a plane fly to Shanghai queue up outside Shandas offices  cost probably   dollars  and reclaim your character get your history back Every morning there are  people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters Laughter So this is about companies built on communities that provide communities with tools resources platforms in which they can share Hes not open source but its very very powerful So here is one of the challenges I think for people like me who do a lot of work with government If youre a games company and youve got a million players in your game you only need one percent of them to be codevelopers contributing ideas and youve got a development workforce of  people Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain and one percent of them were codevelopers of education What would that do to the resources available to the education system Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to in some sense be coproducers of health The reason why  despite all the efforts to cut it down to constrain it to hold it back  why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force is that they multiply our productive resources And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers consumers into designers Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

64,"I bet youre worried I was worried Thats why I began this piece I was worried about vaginas I was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried
that we dont think about them I was worried about my own vagina It needed a context a culture
a community of other vaginas There is so much darkness
and secrecy surrounding them Like the Bermuda Triangle
nobody ever reports back from there In the first place its not so easy
to even find your vagina Women go days weeks months
without looking at it I interviewed a highpowered
businesswoman she told me she didnt have time Looking at your vagina
she said is a full days work Youve got to get down there
on your back in front of a mirror fulllength preferred Youve got to get in the perfect position
with the perfect light which then becomes shadowed
by the angle youre at Youre twisting your head up
arching your back its exhausting She was busy she didnt have time So I decided to talk to women
about their vaginas They began as casual vagina interviews and they turned into vagina monologues I talked with over  women I talked to older women younger women married women lesbians single women I talked to corporate professionals
college professors actors sex workers I talked to AfricanAmerican women
AsianAmerican women NativeAmerican women
Caucasian women Jewish women OK at first women were a little shy
a little reluctant to talk Once they got going
you couldnt stop them Women love to talk
about their vaginas they do Mainly because no ones ever
asked them before Lets just start with the word
vagina  vagina vagina It sounds like an infection at best Maybe a medical instrument Hurry nurse bring the vagina Vagina vagina vagina It doesnt matter how many times
you say the word it never sounds like a word
you want to say Its a completely ridiculous
totally unsexy word If you use it during sex
trying to be politically correct Darling would you stroke my vagina you kill the act right there Im worried what we call them
and dont call them In Great Neck New York
they call it a Pussycat A woman told me there
her mother used to tell her Dont wear panties dear
underneath your pajamas You need to air out your Pussycat In Westchester they call it a Pooki in New Jersey a twat Theres Powderbox derriere
a Pooky a Poochi a Poopi a Poopelu a Pooninana
a Padepachetchki a Pal and a Piche Theres Toadie Dee Dee Nishi
Dignity Coochi Snorcher Cooter Labbe Gladys Seagelman VA Wee wee Horsespot Nappy Dugout Mongo Ghoulie Powderbox
a Mimi in Miami a Split Knish in Philadelphia  and a Schmende in the Bronx I am worried about vaginas This is how the Vagina
Monologues begins But it really didnt begin there It began with a conversation with a woman We were having a conversation
about menopause and we got onto the subject of her vagina which youll do if youre
talking about menopause And she said things that really
shocked me about her vagina  that it was driedup
and finished and dead  and I was kind of shocked So I said to a friend casually Well what do you think
about your vagina And that woman said
something more amazing and then the next woman said
something more amazing and before I knew it
every woman was telling me I had to talk to somebody
about their vagina because they had an amazing story and I was sucked down the vagina trail And I really havent gotten off of it I think if you had told me
when I was younger that I was going to grow up
and be in shoe stores and people would scream out
There she is the Vagina Lady I dont know that that would have
been my life ambition But I want to talk a little bit
about happiness and the relationship
to this whole vagina journey because it has been
an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago I think before I did
the Vagina Monologues I didnt really believe in happiness I thought that only idiots
were happy to be honest I remember when I started
practicing Buddhism  years ago and I was told that the end
of this practice was to be happy I said How could you be happy
and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain I mistook happiness
for a lot of other things like numbness or decadence or selfishness And what happened through the course
of the Vagina Monologues and this journey is
I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness There are three qualities
I want to talk about One is seeing whats
right in front of you and talking about it and stating it I think what I learned
from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina
is it was the most obvious thing  it was right in the center of my body
and the center of the world  and yet it was the one thing
nobody talked about The second thing is that what talking
about the vagina did is it opened this door
which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve
the world to make it better And thats where the deepest happiness
has actually come from And the third principle of happiness
which Ive realized recently Eight years ago this momentum
and this energy this Vwave started  and I can only describe it
as a Vwave because to be honest I really dont understand it completely
I feel at the service of it But this wave started
and if I question the wave or try to stop the wave
or look back at the wave I often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking But if I go with the wave and I trust the wave
and I move with the wave I go to the next place and it happens
logically and organically and truthfully And I started this piece particularly
with stories and narratives and I was talking to one woman
and that led to another woman and that led to another woman And then I wrote those stories down and I put them out
in front of other people And every single time
I did the show at the beginning women would literally
line up after the show because they wanted
to tell me their stories And at first I thought Oh great
Ill hear about wonderful orgasms and great sex lives and how women
love their vaginas But in fact thats not
what women lined up to tell me What women lined up to tell me
was how they were raped and how they were battered
and how they were beaten and how they were gangraped
in parking lots and how they were incested
by their uncles And I wanted to stop doing
the Vagina Monologues because it felt too daunting I felt like a war photographer
who takes pictures of terrible events but doesnt intervene on their behalf And so in  I said
Lets get women together What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated And it turned out after thinking
and investigating that I discovered  and the UN
has actually said this recently  that one out of every three
women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime Thats essentially a gender thats essentially the resource
of the planet which is women So in  we got all these incredible
women together and we said How can we use the play this energy
to stop violence against women And we put on one event
in New York City in the theater and all these great actors
came  from Susan Sarandon to Glenn Close to Whoopi Goldberg  and we did one performance on one evening and that catalyzed this wave this energy And within five years this extraordinary thing began to happen One woman took that energy and she said
I want to bring this wave this energy to college campuses and so she took the play and she said Lets use the play and have
performances once a year where we can raise money
to stop violence against women in local communities
all around the world And in one year it went to  colleges
and then it expanded And over the course of the last six years its spread and its spread
and its spread around the world What I have learned is two things one that the epidemic of violence
towards women is shocking its global it is so profound
and it is so devastating and it is so in every little pocket
of every little crater of every little society
that we dont even recognize it because its become ordinary This journey has taken me to Afghanistan where I had the extraordinary
honor and privilege to go into parts of Afghanistan
under the Taliban I was dressed in a burqa and I went in
with an extraordinary group called the Revolutionary Association
of the Women of Afghanistan And I saw firsthand
how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible
to strip women of  from being educated to being employed to being actually allowed
to eat ice cream For those of you who dont know it was illegal to eat ice cream
under the Taliban And I actually saw and met
women who had been flogged for being caught eating vanilla ice cream I was taken to the secret ice creameating
place in a little town where we went to a back room
and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us
and they were served vanilla ice cream And women lifted their burqas
and ate this ice cream And I dont think I ever understood
pleasure until that moment and how women have found a way
to keep their pleasure alive It has taken me this journey
to Islamabad where I have witnessed and met women
with their faces melted off It has taken me to Juarez Mexico
where I was a week ago where I have literally been
there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to CocaCola bottles It has taken me to universities
all over this country where girls are dateraped and drugged I have seen terrible terrible
terrible violence But I have also recognized
in the course of seeing that violence that being in the face of things
and seeing actually whats in front of us is the antidote to depression and to a feeling that one
is worthless and has no value Because before the Vagina Monologues I will say that  percent
of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on
in this reality and that closingoff closed off
my vitality and my life energy What has also happened
is in the course of these travels  and its been an extraordinary thing  is that every single place
that I have gone to in the world I have met a new species And I really love hearing about all
these species at the bottom of the sea And I was thinking about how being
with these extraordinary people on this particular panel that its beneath beyond and between and the vagina kind of fits
into all those categories But one of the things
Ive seen is this species  and it is a species
and it is a new paradigm and it doesnt get reported
in the press or in the media because I dont think
good news ever is news and I dont think people
who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows But every single country I have been to  and in the last six years
Ive been to about  countries and many tiny little villages
and cities and towns  I have seen something what Ive come
to call vagina warriors A vagina warrior is a woman
or a vaginafriendly man who has witnessed incredible
violence or suffered it and rather than getting an AK
or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete they hold the violence in their bodies they grieve it they experience it
and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure
it doesnt happen to anybody else I have met these women
everywhere on the planet and I want to tell a few stories because I believe that stories are the way
that we transmit information where it goes into our bodies And I think one of the things about being
at TED thats been very interesting is that I live in my body a lot and I dont live in my head
very much anymore And this is a very heady place And its been really interesting
to be in my head for the last two days
Ive been very disoriented  because I think the world the Vworld
is very much in your body Its a body world and the species
really exists in the body And I think theres a real significance
in us attaching our bodies to our heads that that separation has created a divide that is often separating
purpose from intent And the connection between body and head often brings those things into union I want to talk about three
particular people that Ive met vagina warriors who really
transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez Marsha Lopez was a woman
I met in Guatemala She was  years old
and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her
on a regular basis And she couldnt get out because she was addicted
to the relationship and she had no money Her sister was younger than her
and she applied  we had a Stop Rape contest
a few years ago in New York  and she applied hoping
that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister She did become a finalist
she brought Marsha to New York And at that time we did this extraordinary VDay
at Madison Square Garden where we sold out the entire
testosteronefilled dome   people standing up
to say Yes to vaginas which was really a pretty
incredible transformation And she came and she witnessed this and she decided that she would go back
and leave her husband and that she would bring
VDay to Guatemala She was  years old I went to Guatemala and she had sold out
the National Theater of Guatemala And I watched her walk up on stage
in her red short dress and high heels and she stood there and said
My name is Marsha I was beaten by my husband for five years
He almost murdered me I left and you can too And the entire  people
went absolutely crazy Theres a woman named Esther Ch�vez
who I met in Juarez Mexico And Esther Ch�vez was
a brilliant accountant in Mexico City She was  years old
and she was planning to retire She went to Juarez
to take care of an ailing aunt and in the course of it she began
to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared
women of Juarez She gave up her life she moved to Juarez She started to write the stories
which documented the disappeared women  women have disappeared in a border
town because theyre brown and poor There has been no response
to the disappearance and not one person
has been held accountable She began to document it She opened a center called
Casa Amiga and in six years she has literally brought this
to the consciousness of the world We were there a week ago when there were  people
in the street and it was truly a miracle And as we walked through the streets the people of Juarez who normally
dont even come into the streets because the streets are so dangerous literally stood there and wept to see that other people
from the world had showed up for that particular community Theres another woman named Agnes And Agnes for me epitomizes
what a vagina warrior is I met her three years ago in Kenya And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl she was circumcised against her will
when she was  years old and she really made a decision that she didnt want this practice
to continue anymore in her community So when she got older
she created this incredible thing its an anatomical sculpture
of a womans body half a womans body And she walked through the Rift Valley and she had vagina
and vagina replacement parts where she would teach girls
and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like
and what a mutilated vagina looks like And in the course of her travel  she walked literally for eight years
through the Rift Valley through dust through sleeping
on the ground because the Maasai are nomads and she would have to find them
and they would move and she would find them again  she saved  girls from being cut And in that time she created
an alternative ritual which involved girls
coming of age without the cut When we met her three years ago we said What could VDay do for you And she said Well if you got me a jeep
I could get around a lot faster So we bought her a jeep And in the year that she had the jeep
she saved  girls from being cut So we said to her
What else could we do for you She said Well Eve
if you gave me some money I could open a house
and girls could run away and they could be saved And I want to tell this little story
about my own beginnings because its very interrelated
to happiness and Agnes When I was a little girl 
I grew up in a wealthy community it was an uppermiddle class
white community and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice
wonderful great life And everyone was supposed
to be happy in that community and in fact my life was hell I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me
and it was all inside that And always as a child I had this fantasy
that somebody would come and rescue me And I actually made up a little character
whose name was Mr Alligator I would call him up
when things got really bad and say it was time
to come and pick me up And I would pack a little bag
and wait for Mr Alligator to come Now Mr Alligator never did come but the idea of Mr Alligator coming
actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going because I believed in the distance there would be someone
coming to rescue me Cut to some odd years later we go to Kenya and were walking we arrive at the opening of this house And Agnes hadnt let me come
to the house for days because they were preparing
this whole ritual I want to tell you a great story When Agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation
in her community she had become an outcast
and she was exiled and slandered and the whole community
turned against her But being a vagina warrior
she kept going and she kept committing herself
to transforming consciousness And in the Maasai community goats and cows are the most
valued possession Theyre like the MercedesBenz
of the Rift Valley And she said two days
before the house opened two different people arrived
to give her a goat each and she said to me I knew then that female genital
mutilation would end one day in Africa Anyway we arrived and when we arrived there were hundreds of girls
dressed in red homemade dresses  which is the color of the Maasai
and the color of VDay  and they greeted us They had made up these songs
that they were singing about the end of suffering
and the end of mutilation and they walked us down the path It was a gorgeous day in the African sun and the dust was flying
and the girls were dancing and there was this house and it said
VDay Safe House for the Girls And it hit me in that moment
that it had taken  years but that Mr Alligator
had finally shown up And he had shown up obviously in a form that it took me
a long time to understand which is that when we give in the world
what we want the most we heal the broken part inside each of us And I feel in the last eight years that this journey 
this miraculous vagina journey  has taught me this really simple thing which is that happiness exists in action it exists in telling the truth
and saying what your truth is and it exists in giving away
what you want the most And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege and I feel really blessed to have been here today
to communicate that to you Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

65,"Im really excited to be here today Ill show you some stuff
thats just ready to come out of the lab literally and Im really glad
that you guys are going to be among
the first to see it in person because I really think this is going
to really change the way we interact
with machines from this point on Now this is a rearprojected
drafting table Its about  inches wide and its equipped
with a multitouch sensor Normal touch sensors that you see like on a kiosk
or interactive whiteboards can only register one point
of contact at a time This thing allows you to have
multiple points at the same time They can use both my hands
I can use chording actions I can just go right up and use
all  fingers if I wanted to You know like that Now multitouch sensing
isnt completely new People like Bill Buxton have been
playing around with it in the s However the approach I built here
is actually highresolution lowcost and probably
most importantly very scalable So the technology you know isnt the most exciting thing
here right now other than probably
its newfound accessibility Whats really interesting here
is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces
you can build on top of it So lets see So for instance we have
a lava lamp application here Now you can see I can use both of my hands to kind
of squeeze and put the blobs together I can inject heat into the system here or I can pull it apart
with two of my fingers Its completely intuitive
theres no instruction manual The interface just kind of disappears This started out as a screensaver app that one of the PhD students
in our lab Ilya Rosenberg made But I think its true identity
comes out here Now whats great about a multitouch
sensor is that you know I could be doing this
with as many fingers here but of course multitouch
also inherently means multiuser Chris could be interacting
with another part of Lava while I play around with it here You can imagine
a new kind of sculpting tool where Im kind of warming something up
making it malleable and then letting it cool down
and solidifying in a certain state Google should have
something like this in their lobby Ill show you a little more
of a concrete example here as this thing loads This is a photographers
lightbox application Again I can use both of my hands
to interact and move photos around But whats even cooler
is that if I have two fingers I can actually grab a photo and then
stretch it out like that really easily I can pan zoom
and rotate it effortlessly I can do that grossly
with both of my hands or I can do it just with two fingers
on each of my hands together If I grab the canvas I can do
the same thing  stretch it out I can do it simultaneously
holding this down and gripping on another one
stretching this out Again the interface just disappears here Theres no manual This is exactly what you expect especially if you havent interacted
with a computer before Now when you have initiatives
like the  laptop I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new
generation to computing with this standard
mouseandwindowspointer interface This is something that I think
is really the way we should be interacting
with machines from now on Now of course I can bring up a keyboard And I can bring that around
put that up there Obviously this is a standard keyboard but of course I can rescale it
to make it work well for my hands Thats really important because
theres no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming
to a physical device That leads to bad things like RSI We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces
should start conforming to us Theres so little applied now
to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces
from this point on This keyboard is probably actually
the really wrong direction to go You can imagine in the future
as we develop this kind of technology a keyboard that kind of automatically
drifts as your hand moves away and really intelligently anticipates
which key youre trying to stroke So  again isnt this great Audience Wheres your lab Jeff Han Im a research scientist
at NYU in New York Heres an example of another kind of app
I can make these little fuzz balls Itll remember the strokes Im making Of course I can do it with all my hands Its pressuresensitive Whats neat about that is I showed that twofinger gesture
that zooms in really quickly Because you dont have
to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales
all at the same time I can create big things out here but I can go back
and really quickly go back to where I started
and make even smaller things here This is going to be really important as we start getting to things
like data visualization For instance I think
we all enjoyed Hans Roslings talk and he really emphasized the fact
Ive been thinking about for a long time We have all this great data but for some reason
its just sitting there Were not accessing it And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics
and visualization and inference tools but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces to be able to drill down
into this kind of data while still thinking
about the big picture here Let me show you another app here
This is called WorldWind Its done by NASA Weve all seen Google Earth this is an opensource version of that There are plugins to be able
to load in different data sets that NASAs collected over the years As you can see I can use
the same twofingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly Theres no interface again It really allows anybody
to kind of go in  and it just does
what youd expect you know Again theres just no interface here
The interface just disappears I can switch to different data views Thats whats neat about this app here NASAs really cool These hyperspectral images
are falsecolored so you can  its really good for determining
vegetative use Well lets go back to this The great thing
about mapping applications  its not really D its D So again with a multipoint interface
you can do a gesture like this  so you can be able
to tilt around like that  Surprised laughter Its not just simply relegated
to a kind of D panning and motion This gesture is just putting
two fingers down  its defining an axis of tilt 
and I can tilt up and down that way We just came up with that on the spot its probably not the right thing to do but theres such interesting things
you can do with this interface Its just so much fun
playing around with it too And so the last thing
I want to show you is  Im sure we can all think
of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing Im more interested in the creative
applications we can do with this Now heres a simple application here 
I can draw out a curve And when I close it
it becomes a character But the neat thing about it
is I can add control points And then what I can do is manipulate them
with both of my fingers at the same time And you notice what it does Its kind of a puppeteering thing where I can use as many fingers
as I have to draw and make  Now theres a lot of actual math
going on under here for this to control this mesh
and do the right thing This technique of being able to manipulate
a mesh here with multiple control points is actually state of the art It was released at SIGGRAPH last year Its a great example
of the kind of research I really love all this compute power
to make things do the right things intuitive things
to do exactly what you expect So multitouch interaction research
is a very active field right now in HCI Im not the only one doing it
a lot of other people are getting into it This kind of technology is going to let
even more people get into it Im looking forward to interacting
with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply
to your respective fields Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

66,"Good morning How are you Its been great hasnt it Ive been blown away by the whole thing In fact Im leaving There have been three themes
running through the conference which are relevant
to what I want to talk about One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that weve had and in all of the people here Just the variety of it
and the range of it The second is
that its put us in a place where we have no idea
whats going to happen in terms of the future No idea how this may play out I have an interest in education Actually what I find is everybody
has an interest in education Dont you I find this very interesting If youre at a dinner party and you say you work in education  Actually youre not often
at dinner parties frankly If you work in education
youre not asked And youre never asked back curiously
Thats strange to me But if you are and you say to somebody you know they say What do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face Theyre like Oh my God
you know Why me My one night out all week But if you ask about their education
they pin you to the wall Because its one of those things
that goes deep with people am I right Like religion and money and other things So I have a big interest in education
and I think we all do We have a huge vested interest in it partly because its education
thats meant to take us into this future that we cant grasp If you think of it
children starting school this year will be retiring in  Nobody has a clue despite all the expertise thats been
on parade for the past four days what the world will look like
in five years time And yet were meant
to be educating them for it So the unpredictability
I think is extraordinary And the third part of this is that weve all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary
capacities that children have  their capacities for innovation I mean Sirena last night
was a marvel wasnt she Just seeing what she could do And shes exceptional but I think
shes not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication who found a talent And my contention is
all kids have tremendous talents And we squander them pretty ruthlessly So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it
with the same status Applause Thank you That was it by the way Thank you very much So  minutes left Well I was born no I heard a great story recently
 I love telling it  of a little girl
who was in a drawing lesson She was six and she was
at the back drawing and the teacher said this girl
hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did The teacher was fascinated She went over to her
and she said What are you drawing And the girl said Im
drawing a picture of God And the teacher said But nobody
knows what God looks like And the girl said
They will in a minute When my son was four in England  Actually he was four
everywhere to be honest If were being strict about it
wherever he went he was four that year He was in the Nativity play
Do you remember the story No it was big it was a big story Mel Gibson did the sequel
you may have seen it Nativity II But James got the part of Joseph
which we were thrilled about We considered this to be
one of the lead parts We had the place crammed
full of agents in Tshirts James Robinson IS Joseph Laughter He didnt have to speak but you know the bit
where the three kings come in They come in bearing gifts
gold frankincense and myrrh This really happened We were sitting there and I think
they just went out of sequence because we talked to the little boy
afterward and we said You OK with that And he said
Yeah why Was that wrong They just switched The three boys came in fouryearolds with tea towels
on their heads and they put these boxes down and the first boy said
I bring you gold And the second boy said
I bring you myrrh And the third boy said Frank sent this What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance If they dont know theyll have a go Am I right Theyre not
frightened of being wrong I dont mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative What we do know is
if youre not prepared to be wrong youll never come up
with anything original  if youre not prepared to be wrong And by the time they get to be adults
most kids have lost that capacity They have become
frightened of being wrong And we run our companies like this We stigmatize mistakes And were now running
national education systems where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make And the result is that
we are educating people out of their creative capacities Picasso once said this he said
that all children are born artists The problem is to remain an artist
as we grow up I believe this passionately
that we dont grow into creativity we grow out of it Or rather we get educated out of it So why is this I lived in StratfordonAvon
until about five years ago In fact we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles So you can imagine
what a seamless transition that was Actually we lived in a place
called Snitterfield just outside Stratford which is where
Shakespeares father was born Are you struck by a new thought I was You dont think of Shakespeare
having a father do you Do you Because you dont think
of Shakespeare being a child do you Shakespeare being seven I never thought of it I mean he was seven at some point He was in somebodys
English class wasnt he How annoying would that be Must try harder Being sent to bed by his dad you know
to Shakespeare Go to bed now And put the pencil down And stop speaking like that Its confusing everybody Anyway we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles and I just want to say a word
about the transition My son didnt want to come Ive got two kids
hes  now my daughters  He didnt want to come to Los Angeles He loved it but he had
a girlfriend in England This was the love of his life Sarah Hed known her for a month Mind you theyd had
their fourth anniversary because its a long time when youre  He was really upset on the plane he said Ill never find
another girl like Sarah And we were rather pleased
about that frankly  Because she was the main reason
we were leaving the country But something strikes you
when you move to America and travel around the world Every education system on Earth
has the same hierarchy of subjects Every one Doesnt matter where you go Youd think it would be
otherwise but it isnt At the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities
and at the bottom are the arts Everywhere on Earth And in pretty much every system too
theres a hierarchy within the arts Art and music are normally
given a higher status in schools than drama and dance There isnt an education
system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics Why Why not I think this is rather important I think math is very
important but so is dance Children dance all the time
if theyre allowed to we all do We all have bodies dont we
Did I miss a meeting Truthfully what happens is
as children grow up we start to educate them progressively
from the waist up And then we focus on their heads And slightly to one side If you were to visit
education as an alien and say Whats it for public education I think youd have to conclude
if you look at the output who really succeeds by this who does everything that they should who gets all the brownie
points who are the winners  I think youd have to conclude
the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors Isnt it Theyre the people who come out the top And I used to be one so there And I like university
professors but you know we shouldnt hold them up as the highwater mark
of all human achievement Theyre just a form of life another form of life But theyre rather curious and I say this
out of affection for them Theres something curious
about professors in my experience  not all of them but typically
they live in their heads They live up there
and slightly to one side Theyre disembodied you know
in a kind of literal way They look upon their body as a form
of transport for their heads Dont they Its a way of getting
their head to meetings If you want real evidence
of outofbody experiences get yourself along to a residential
conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque
on the final night And there you will see it Grown men and women
writhing uncontrollably off the beat Waiting until it ends so they can
go home and write a paper about it Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability And theres a reason Around the world there were
no public systems of education really before the th century They all came into being
to meet the needs of industrialism So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas Number one that the most useful
subjects for work are at the top So you were
probably steered benignly away from things at school when you
were a kid things you liked on the grounds that you would
never get a job doing that Is that right Dont do music youre not
going to be a musician dont do art you wont be an artist Benign advice  now profoundly mistaken The whole world
is engulfed in a revolution And the second is academic ability which has really come to dominate
our view of intelligence because the universities designed
the system in their image If you think of it the whole system
of public education around the world is a protracted process
of university entrance And the consequence
is that many highlytalented brilliant creative
people think theyre not because the thing
they were good at at school wasnt valued
or was actually stigmatized And I think we cant afford
to go on that way In the next  years according to UNESCO more people worldwide will be graduating through education
than since the beginning of history More people and its the combination
of all the things weve talked about  technology and its transformation
effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population Suddenly degrees arent worth anything Isnt that true When I was a student
if you had a degree you had a job If you didnt have a job
its because you didnt want one And I didnt want one frankly Laughter But now kids with degrees are often heading home
to carry on playing video games because you need an MA where
the previous job required a BA and now you need a PhD for the other Its a process of academic inflation And it indicates the whole
structure of education is shifting beneath our feet We need to radically rethink
our view of intelligence We know three things about intelligence One its diverse We think about the world in all the ways
that we experience it We think visually we think in sound
we think kinesthetically We think in abstract terms
we think in movement Secondly intelligence is dynamic If you look at the interactions
of a human brain as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive The brain isnt divided into compartments In fact creativity 
which I define as the process of having original ideas
that have value  more often than not comes about
through the interaction of different disciplinary
ways of seeing things By the way theres a shaft of nerves
that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum Its thicker in women Following off from Helen yesterday this is probably why women
are better at multitasking Because you are arent you Theres a raft of research
but I know it from my personal life If my wife is cooking a meal at home 
which is not often thankfully No shes good at some things
but if shes cooking shes dealing with people on the phone shes talking to the kids
shes painting the ceiling shes doing openheart surgery over here If Im cooking the door
is shut the kids are out the phones on the hook
if she comes in I get annoyed I say Terry please
Im trying to fry an egg in here Give me a break Actually do you know
that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a forest
and nobody hears it did it happen Remember that old chestnut I saw a great tshirt
recently which said If a man speaks his mind
in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong And the third thing about intelligence is its distinct Im doing a new book at the moment
called Epiphany which is based on a series
of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent Im fascinated
by how people got to be there Its really prompted by a conversation
I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people
have never heard of Gillian Lynne Have you heard of her Some have Shes a choreographer
and everybody knows her work She did Cats and Phantom of the Opera Shes wonderful I used to be on the board
of The Royal Ballet as you can see Anyway Gillian and I had
lunch one day and I said How did you get to be a dancer It was interesting When she was at school
she was really hopeless And the school in the s
wrote to her parents and said We think Gillian
has a learning disorder She couldnt concentrate
she was fidgeting I think now theyd say she had ADHD
Wouldnt you But this was the s and ADHD
hadnt been invented at this point It wasnt an available condition People werent aware they could have that Anyway she went to see this specialist So this oakpaneled room
and she was there with her mother and she was led and sat
on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for  minutes
while this man talked to her mother about the problems
Gillian was having at school Because she was disturbing people
her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight In the end the doctor
went and sat next to Gillian and said Ive listened to all these
things your mothers told me I need to speak to her privately Wait here Well be back
we wont be very long and they went and left her But as they went out of the room he turned on the radio
that was sitting on his desk And when they got out he said to her
mother Just stand and watch her And the minute they left the room she was on her feet moving to the music And they watched for a few minutes
and he turned to her mother and said Mrs Lynne Gillian
isnt sick shes a dancer Take her to a dance school I said What happened She said She did I cant tell you
how wonderful it was We walked in this room
and it was full of people like me People who couldnt sit still People who had to move to think
Who had to move to think They did ballet they did tap jazz
they did modern they did contemporary She was eventually auditioned
for the Royal Ballet School she became a soloist she had
a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet She eventually graduated
from the Royal Ballet School founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company met Andrew Lloyd Webber Shes been responsible for some of the most successful
musical theater productions in history shes given pleasure to millions
and shes a multimillionaire Somebody else might have put her
on medication and told her to calm down What I think it comes to is this Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution
that was triggered by Rachel Carson I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception
of human ecology one in which we start
to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we stripmine the earth
for a particular commodity And for the future it wont serve us We have to rethink
the fundamental principles on which were educating our children There was a wonderful quote
by Jonas Salk who said If all the insects
were to disappear from the Earth within  years all life
on Earth would end If all human beings
disappeared from the Earth within  years all forms
of life would flourish And hes right What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios
that weve talked about And the only way well do it is by seeing
our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children
for the hope that they are And our task is to educate
their whole being so they can face this future By the way  we may not see this future but they will And our job is to help them
make something of it Thank you very much ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

67,As other speakers have said its a rather daunting experience  a particularly daunting experience  to be speaking in front of this audience But unlike the other speakers Im not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe or the wonders of evolution or the really clever innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world Or even the challenges of nationstates in the modern global economy My brief as youve just heard is to tell you about statistics  and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics And thats   thats rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me One of my senior colleagues told me when I was a youngster in this profession rather proudly that statisticians were people who liked figures but didnt have the personality skills to become accountants And theres another injoke among statisticians and thats How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician To which the answer is The extroverted statisticians the one who looks at the other persons shoes But I want to tell you something useful  and here it is so concentrate now This evening theres a reception in the Universitys Museum of Natural History And its a wonderful setting as I hope youll find and a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition Its very unlikely  in this special setting and this collection of people  but you might just find yourself talking to someone youd rather wish that you werent So heres what you do When they say to you What do you do  you say Im a statistician Well except theyve been prewarned now and theyll know youre making it up And then one of two things will happen Theyll either discover their longlost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them Or theyll suddenly become parched andor hungry  and often both  and sprint off for a drink and some food And youll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to Its one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do Were not top on peoples lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on And its something Ive never really found a good way of doing But my wife  who was then my girlfriend  managed it much better than Ive ever been able to Many years ago when we first started going out she was working for the BBC in Britain and I was at that stage working in America I was coming back to visit her She told this to one of her colleagues who said Well what does your boyfriend do Sarah thought quite hard about the things Id explained  and she concentrated in those days on listening Dont tell her I said that And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics So when her colleague said What does he do She paused and said He models things Well her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said What does he model Well Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said Genes He models genes That is my first love and thats what Ill tell you a little bit about What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world and how we react to that and how well we do or dont think about it So youve had a pretty easy time up till now  a few laughs and all that kind of thing  in the talks to date Youve got to think and Im going to ask you some questions So heres the scene for the first question Im going to ask you Can you imagine tossing a coin successively And for some reason  which shall remain rather vague  were interested in a particular pattern Heres one  a head followed by a tail followed by a tail So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly Then the pattern headtailtail that weve suddenly become fixated with happens here And you can count one two three four five six seven eight nine   it happens after the th toss So you might think there are more interesting things to do but humor me for the moment Imagine this half of the audience each get out coins and they toss them until they first see the pattern headtailtail The first time they do it maybe it happens after the th toss as here The second time maybe its after the fourth toss The next time after the th toss So you do that lots and lots of times and you average those numbers Thats what I want this side to think about The other half of the audience doesnt like headtailtail  they think for deep cultural reasons thats boring  and theyre much more interested in a different pattern  headtailhead So on this side you get out your coins and you toss and toss and toss And you count the number of times until the pattern headtailhead appears and you average them OK So on this side youve got a number  youve done it lots of times so you get it accurately  which is the average number of tosses until headtailtail On this side youve got a number  the average number of tosses until headtailhead So heres a deep mathematical fact  if youve got two numbers one of three things must be true Either theyre the same or this ones bigger than this one or this ones bigger than that one So whats going on here So youve all got to think about this and youve all got to vote  and were not moving on And I dont want to end up in the twominute silence to give you more time to think about it until everyones expressed a view OK So what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see headtailhead with the average number of tosses until we first see headtailtail Who thinks that A is true  that on average itll take longer to see headtailhead than headtailtail Who thinks that B is true  that on average theyre the same Who thinks that C is true  that on average itll take less time to see headtailhead than headtailtail OK who hasnt voted yet Because thats really naughty  I said you had to OK So most people think B is true And you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that Its not A is true here It takes longer on average In fact the average number of tosses till headtailhead is  and the average number of tosses until headtailtail is eight How could that be Anything different about the two patterns There is Headtailhead overlaps itself If you went headtailheadtailhead you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses You cant do that with headtailtail That turns out to be important There are two ways of thinking about this Ill give you one of them So imagine  lets suppose were doing it On this side  remember youre excited about headtailtail youre excited about headtailhead We start tossing a coin and we get a head  and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful or awesome might be about to happen The next toss is a tail  you get really excited The champagnes on ice just next to you youve got the glasses chilled to celebrate Youre waiting with bated breath for the final toss And if it comes down a head thats great Youre done and you celebrate If its a tail  well rather disappointedly you put the glasses away and put the champagne back And you keep tossing to wait for the next head to get excited On this side theres a different experience Its the same for the first two parts of the sequence Youre a little bit excited with the first head  you get rather more excited with the next tail Then you toss the coin If its a tail you crack open the champagne If its a head youre disappointed but youre still a third of the way to your pattern again And thats an informal way of presenting it  thats why theres a difference Another way of thinking about it  if we tossed a coin eight million times then wed expect a million headtailheads and a million headtailtails  but the headtailheads could occur in clumps So if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions and you can have some of them overlapping the clumps will be further apart Its another way of getting the intuition Whats the point I want to make Its a very very simple example an easily stated question in probability which every  youre in good company  everybody gets wrong This is my little diversion into my real passion which is genetics Theres a connection between headtailheads and headtailtails in genetics and its the following When you toss a coin you get a sequence of heads and tails When you look at DNA theres a sequence of not two things  heads and tails  but four letters  As Gs Cs and Ts And there are little chemical scissors called restriction enzymes which cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns And theyre an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology And instead of asking the question How long until I see a headtailhead  you can ask How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees GAAG for example How long will those chunks be Thats a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics Theres a much deeper connection which I dont have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science And well hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated  youll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job rather more sophisticated than the headtailhead story  but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques And I will give you two little snippets  two examples  of projects were involved in in my group in Oxford both of which I think are rather exciting You know about the Human Genome Project That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome The natural thing to do after youve done that  and thats what this project the International HapMap Project which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what weve got in common and the HapMap Project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people Why do we care about that Well there are lots of reasons The most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease  type diabetes for example  and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease or stroke or autism and so on Thats one big project Theres a second big project recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country involving very large studies  thousands of individuals with each of eight different diseases common diseases like type and type diabetes and coronary heart disease bipolar disease and so on  to try and understand the genetics To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases Why do we want to do that Because we understand very little about most human diseases We dont know what causes them And if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics well have a window on the way the disease works and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on So thats as I said the little diversion on my main love Back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty Heres another quiz for you  now suppose weve got a test for a disease which isnt infallible but its pretty good It gets it right  percent of the time And I take one of you or I take someone off the street and I test them for the disease in question Lets suppose theres a test for HIV  the virus that causes AIDS  and the test says the person has the disease Whats the chance that they do The test gets it right  percent of the time So a natural answer is  percent Who likes that answer Come on  everyones got to get involved Dont think you dont trust me anymore Well youre right to be a bit skeptical because thats not the answer Thats what you might think Its not the answer and its not because its only part of the story It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is So let me try and illustrate that Heres a little caricature of a million individuals So lets think about a disease that affects  its pretty rare it affects one person in  Amongst these million individuals most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease And in fact if this is the prevalence of the disease about  will have the disease and the rest wont So now suppose we test them all What happens Well amongst the  who do have the disease the test will get it right  percent of the time and  will test positive Amongst all these other people who dont have the disease the test will get it right  percent of the time Itll only get it wrong one percent of the time But there are so many of them that therell be an enormous number of false positives Put that another way  of all of them who test positive  so here they are the individuals involved  less than one in  actually have the disease So even though we think the test is accurate the important part of the story is theres another bit of information we need Heres the key intuition What we have to do once we know the test is positive is to weigh up the plausibility or the likelihood of two competing explanations Each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit One explanation is that the person doesnt have the disease  thats overwhelmingly likely if you pick someone at random  but the test gets it wrong which is unlikely The other explanation is that the person does have the disease  thats unlikely  but the test gets it right which is likely And the number we end up with  that number which is a little bit less than one in   is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other Each of them taken together is unlikely Heres a more topical example of exactly the same thing Those of you in Britain will know about whats become rather a celebrated case of a woman called Sally Clark who had two babies who died suddenly And initially it was thought that they died of whats known informally as cot death and more formally as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome For various reasons she was later charged with murder And at the trial her trial a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths innocent deaths in a family like hers  which was professional and nonsmoking  was one in  million To cut a long story short she was convicted at the time Later and fairly recently acquitted on appeal  in fact on the second appeal And just to set it in context you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child and then two if theyre innocent to be convicted of murdering them To be put through the stress of the trial convicted of murdering them  and to spend time in a womens prison where all the other prisoners think you killed your children  is a really awful thing to happen to someone And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong in two different ways So where did he get the one in  million number He looked at some research which said the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clarks is about one in  So he said Ill assume that if you have one cot death in a family the chance of a second child dying from cot death arent changed So thats what statisticians would call an assumption of independence Its like saying If you toss a coin and get a head the first time that wont affect the chance of getting a head the second time So if you toss a coin twice the chance of getting a head twice are a half  thats the chance the first time  times a half  the chance a second time So he said Here Ill assume that these events are independent When you multiply  together twice you get about  million And none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way Unfortunately here  and really regrettably  first of all in a situation like this youd have to verify it empirically And secondly its palpably false There are lots and lots of things that we dont know about sudden infant deaths It might well be that there are environmental factors that were not aware of and its pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors were not aware of So if a family suffers from one cot death youd put them in a highrisk group Theyve probably got these environmental risk factors andor genetic risk factors we dont know about And to argue then that the chance of a second death is as if you didnt know that information is really silly Its worse than silly  its really bad science Nonetheless thats how it was presented and at trial nobody even argued it Thats the first problem The second problem is what does the number of one in  million mean So after Sally Clark was convicted  you can imagine it made rather a splash in the press  one of the journalists from one of Britains more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was The chance that she was innocent was one in  million Now thats a logical error Its exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test which is  percent accurate the chance of having the disease is  percent In the disease example we had to bear in mind two things one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not And the other one was the chance a priori that the person had the disease or not Its exactly the same in this context There are two things involved  two parts to the explanation We want to know how likely or relatively how likely two different explanations are One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent  which is a priori overwhelmingly likely  most mothers dont kill their children And the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event Not as unlikely as one in  million but nonetheless rather unlikely The other explanation is that she was guilty Now we probably think a priori thats unlikely And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that thats unlikely because of the presumption of innocence And then if she were trying to kill the children she succeeded So the chance that shes innocent isnt one in  million We dont know what it is It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence We know the children died What matters is how likely or unlikely relative to each other the two explanations are And theyre both implausible Theres a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences In fact there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician who have subsequently been released on appeal Many cases were reviewed And its particularly topical because hes currently facing a disrepute charge at Britains General Medical Council So just to conclude  what are the takehome messages from this Well we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life Its also true  and although you as a collective are very special in many ways youre completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right Its very well documented that people get things wrong They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly  and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty Thats an issue in our everyday lives As youve heard from many of the talks statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science  in social science in medicine and indeed quite a lot of industry All of quality control which has had a major impact on industrial processing is underpinned by statistics Its something were bad at doing At the very least we should recognize that and we tend not to To go back to the legal context at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury I know how to build bridges Ive built one down the road Please drive your car home over it they would have said Well pediatricians dont know how to build bridges Thats what engineers do On the other hand he came out and effectively said or implied I know how to reason with uncertainty I know how to do statistics And everyone said Well thats fine Hes an expert So we need to understand where our competence is and isnt Exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling when scientists and lawyers and in some cases judges routinely misrepresented evidence Usually  one hopes  innocently but misrepresented evidence Forensic scientists said The chance that this guys innocent is one in three million Even if you believe the number just like the  million to one thats not what it meant And there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that And just to finish in the context of the legal system Its all very well to say Lets do our best to present the evidence But more and more in cases of DNA profiling  this is another one  we expect juries who are ordinary people  and its documented theyre very bad at this  we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on In other spheres of life if people argued  well except possibly for politics  but in other spheres of life if people argued illogically wed say thats not a good thing We sort of expect it of politicians and dont hope for much more In the case of uncertainty we get it wrong all the time  and at the very least we should be aware of that and ideally we might try and do something about it Thanks very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

68,Ive got apparently  minutes to convince you that history has a direction an arrow that in some fundamental sense its good that the arrow points to something positive Now when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk   that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting It was before the avian flu had reached Europe It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election eliciting various countermeasures by Israel And to be honest if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk the apocalypse would be unfolding   I might have said Is it okay if I talk about something else But I didnt OK So were here Ill do what I can Ill do what I can Ive got to warn you the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle sometimes even elusive The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring  I mean theres always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift so if grim inspiration   if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms that is Im afraid the most you can hope for OK today  thats if I succeed Ill see what I can do OK Now in one sense the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial If youre just talking about social structure OK clearly thats gotten more complex a little over the last  years  has reached higher and higher levels And in fact thats actually sustaining a longstanding trend that predates human beings OK that biological evolution was doing for us Because what happened in the beginning this stuff encases itself in a cell then cells start hanging out together in societies Eventually they get so close they form multicellular organisms then you get complex multicellular organisms they form societies But then at some point one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution cultural evolution And amazingly that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas A lot of you have heard the term memes The evolution of technology I pay a lot of attention to so you know one of the first things you got was a little hand axe Generations go by somebody says hey why dont we put it on a stick Just absolutely delights the little ones Next best thing to a video game This may not seem to impress but technological evolution is progressive so another   years and armaments technology takes you here Impressive And the rate of technological evolution speeds up so a mere quarter of a century after this you get this OK And this Im sorry  it was a cheap laugh but I wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse and I thought that might do it So what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization Now first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are to be on the brink of true global social organization Originally you had the most complex societies the huntergatherer village Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom which is what you get with the invention of agriculture multivillage polity with centralized rule With the invention of writing you start getting cities This is blurry I kind of like that because it makes it look like a onecelled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point And then you get to you know you get empires I want to stress you know social organization can transcend political bounds This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent even if no polity did similarly Today youve got nation states Point is theres obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds This is actually just a picture of the earth at night and Im just putting it up because I think its pretty Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system Now I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called nonzero sumness Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading very quickly the key idea is the distinction between zerosum games in which correlations are inverse always a winner and a loser Nonzerosum games in which correlations can be positive OK So like in tennis usually its winlose it always adds up to zerozerosum But if youre playing doubles the person on your side of the net theyre in the same boat as you so youre playing a nonzerosum game with them Its either for the better or for the worse OK A lot of forms of nonzerosum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation The argument I make is basically that well nonzerosum games have always been part of life You have them in huntergatherer societies but then through technological evolution new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of nonzerosum games involving more people over larger territory Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential so you get cities you know and you get all the nonzerosum games you dont think about that are being played across the world Like have you ever thought when you buy a car how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car Those are people in effect youre playing a nonzerosum game with I mean there are certainly plenty of them around Now this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way because when you think of nonzero you think winwin you know thats good Well there are a few reasons that actually its not intrinsically upbeat First of all it can accommodate it doesnt deny the existence of inequality exploitation war But theres a more fundamental reason that its not intrinsically upbeat because a nonzerosum game all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse It doesnt necessarily predict a winwin outcome So in a way the question is on what grounds am I upbeat at all about history And the answer is first of all on balance I would say people have played their games to more winwin outcomes than loselose outcomes On balance I think history is a net positive in the nonzerosum game department And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me most impresses me and most uplifts me which is that there is a moral dimension to history there is a moral arrow We have seen moral progress over time  years ago members of one Greek citystate considered members of another Greek citystate subhuman and treated them that way And then this moral revolution arrived and they decided that actually no Greeks are human beings Its just the Persians who arent fully human and dont deserve to be treated very nicely But this was progress  you know give them credit And now today weve seen more progress I think  I hope  most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings deserve to be treated decently unless they do something horrendous regardless of race or religion And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been OK This was not a prevalent view few thousand years ago and I attribute it to this nonzerosum dynamic I think thats the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities ethnicities religions as there is today If you asked me you know why am I not in favor of bombing Japan well Im only halfjoking when I say they built my car We have this nonzerosum relationship and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone elses welfare is positively correlated with yours  youre more likely to cut them a break I kind of think this is a kind of a businessclass morality Unfortunately I dont fly transAtlantic business class often enough to know or any other kind of business class really but I assume that in business class you dont hear many expressions of you know bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups because the people who are flying transAtlantic business class are doing business with all these people theyre making money off all these people And I really do think that in that sense at least capitalism has been a constructive force and more fundamentally its a nonzerosumness that has been a constructive force in expanding peoples realm of moral awareness I think the nonzerosum dynamic which is not only economic by any means  its not always commerce  but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth which is the fundamental equality of everyone It has done that As it has moved global moved us toward a global level of social organization it has driven us toward moral truth I think thats wonderful Now back to the unfolding apocalypse And you may wonder OK thats all fine sounds great  moral direction in history  but what about this socalled clash of civilizations Well first of all I would emphasize that it fits into the nonzerosum framework OK If you look at the relationship between the socalled Muslim world and Western world  two terms I dont like but cant really avoid in such a short span of time theyre efficient if nothing else  it is nonzerosum And by that I mean if people in the Muslim world get more hateful more resentful less happy with their place in the world itll be bad for the West If they get more happy itll be good for the West So that is a nonzerosum dynamic And I would say the nonzerosum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends but more intense in a kind of negative way Its the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible And one reason is because of something I call the growing lethality of hatred More and more its possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil And thats pretty new and I think its probably going to get a lot worse  this capacity  because of trends in information technology in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology We may be hearing more about that today And theres something I worry about especially which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope What I have in mind is terrorism happens here we overreact to it That you know were not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad more terrorism We overreact because being human we feel like retaliating and it gets worse and worse and worse You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes but I think in something so spooky we really shouldnt have the word positive there at all even in a technical sense So lets call it the death spiral of negativity I assure you if it happens at the end both the West and the Muslim world will have suffered So what do we do Well first of all we can do a lot more with arms control the international regulation of dangerous technologies I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now because I dont think thats going to be enough anyway although its essential I think were going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world I think youre just going to have to see less hatred among groups less bigotry and you know racial groups religious groups whatever Ive got to admit I feel silly saying that It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish I feel like Rodney King you know saying why cant we all just get along But hey I dont really see any alternative given the way I read the situation Theres going to have to be moral progress Theres going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world given how dangerous its becoming In my defense Id say as naive as this may sound its ultimately grounded in cynicism That is to say   thank you thank you That is to say remember my whole view of morality is that it boils down to selfinterest Its when peoples fortunes are correlated Its when your welfare conduces to mine that I decide oh yeah Im all in favor of your welfare Thats whats responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far and Im saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes and if people respond to it intelligently we will see the development of tolerance and so on  the norms that we need you know We will see the further evolution of this kind of businessclass morality So these two things you know if they get peoples attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do whats in their selfinterests which is further the moral evolution then they could actually have a constructive effect And thats why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric reasons to be cheerful Doing the best I can OK I never called myself Mr Uplift Im just doing what I can here Now launching a moral revolution has got to be hard right I mean what do you do And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things We all start where we are Speaking as an American who has children whose security    years down the road I worry about  what I personally want to start out doing is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us OK I think thats a worthy research project myself I also like it because its an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something  somebody youre kind of viewing as alien whos doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange  to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment because youve got to relate their experience to yours To really understand it youve got to say Oh I get it So when they feel resentful its kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happens and for somewhat the same reasons Thats true understanding And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that Its especially hard to do when people hate you OK because you dont really in a sense want to completely understand why people hate you I mean you want to hear the reason but you dont want to be able to relate to it You dont want it to make sense right Laughter You dont want to say Well yeah I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in Thats not a pleasant thing but I think its something that were going to have to get used to and work on Now I want to stress that to understand you know  there are people who dont like this whole business of understanding the grassroots the root causes of things they dont want to know why people hate us I want to understand it The reason youre trying to understand why they hate us is to get them to quit hating us The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run I think its the first step toward that Thats the longterm goal There are people who worry about this and in fact I myself apparently was denounced on national TV a couple of nights ago because of an oped Id written It was kind of along these lines and the allegation was that I have quote affection for terrorists Now the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter I mean if youve got to have an enemy do make it Ann Coulter But its not a crazy concern OK because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love and so on But I think were a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough than in comprehending it so clearly that we just cant you know get the army out to kill terrorists So Im not really worried about it So   I mean were going to have to work on a lot of fronts but if we succeed  if we succeed  then once again nonzerosumness and the recognition of nonzerosum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level And a kind of saving higher moral level something that kind of literally saves the world If you look at the word salvation in the Bible  the Christian usage that were familiar with  saving souls that people go to heaven  thats actually a latecomer The original meaning of the word salvation in the Bible is about saving the social system Yahweh is our Savior means He has saved the nation of Israel which at the time was a pretty highlevel social organization Now social organization has reached the global level and I guess if theres good news I can say Im bringing you its just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of selfinterests in a disciplined and careful way Its going to be hard I say we give it a shot anyway because weve just come too far to screw it up now Thanks ,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

69,You know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past in the wind touch it in stones polished by rain taste it in the bitter leaves of plants Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the Himalaya the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense but is just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made albeit successfully many generations ago And of course we all share the same adaptive imperatives Were all born We all bring our children into the world We go through initiation rites We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death so it shouldnt surprise us that we all sing we all dance we all have art But whats interesting is the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara  this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago  or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma Everest the goddess mother of the world All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth And this is an idea if you think about it can only fill you with hope Now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet and is as important to the wellbeing of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams myths ideas inspirations intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness The ethnosphere is humanitys great legacy Its the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded so too is the ethnosphere  and if anything at a far greater rate No biologists for example would dare suggest that  percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that  the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity  scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity And the great indicator of that of course is language loss When each of you in this room were born there were  languages spoken on the planet Now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules A language is a flash of the human spirit Its a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world Every language is an oldgrowth forest of the mind a watershed a thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities And of those  languages as we sit here today in Monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children Theyre no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes theyre already dead What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children And yet that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue And I know theres some of you who say Well wouldnt it be better wouldnt the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language And I say Great lets make that language Yoruba Lets make it Cantonese Lets make it Kogi And youll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language And so what Id like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost Now there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say different ways of being I really do mean different ways of being Take for example this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes Now this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speaks a different language And this is all rooted in the mythological past yet the curious thing is in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language They simply listen and then begin to speak Or one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in  In  five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake They dropped from the air  x  glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything twodimensional in their lives They picked up these photographs from the forest floor tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure found nothing and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death But the Waorani didnt just spear outsiders They speared each other  percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other We traced genealogies back eight generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway Laughter But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing Their hunters could smell animal urine at  paces and tell you what species left it behind In the early s I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvaliers strength and Tonton Macoutes and securing the poison used to make zombies In order to make sense out of sensation of course I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun And Voodoo is not a black magic cult On the contrary its a complex metaphysical worldview Its interesting If I asked you to name the great religions of the world what would you say Christianity Islam Buddhism Judaism whatever Theres always one continent left out the assumption being that subSaharan Africa had no religious beliefs Well of course they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era But what makes Voodoo so interesting is that its this living relationship between the living and the dead So the living give birth to the spirits The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living so that for that brief shining moment the acolyte becomes the god Thats why the Voodooists like to say that You white people go to church and speak about God We dance in the temple and become God And because you are possessed you are taken by the spirit  how can you be harmed So you see these astonishing demonstrations Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation Now of all the peoples that Ive ever been with the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia in the wake of the conquest these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain In a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish To this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for  years two nineyear periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mothers womb now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother And for this entire time they are inculturated into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic  or we might say the ecological  balance And at the end of this amazing initiation one day theyre suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives at the age of  they see a sunrise And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory And the priest steps back and says You see Its really as Ive told you It is that beautiful It is yours to protect They call themselves the elder brothers and they say we who are the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world Now this level of intuition becomes very important Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the noble savage which is an idea racist in its simplicity or alternatively we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are Well indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia Theres not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being selfconsciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness Now what does that mean It means that a young kid from the Andes whos raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined Whether its the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant Whats interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation Now if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries Take this plant here Its a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April This is ayahuasca which many of you have heard about the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shamans repertoire What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it Its made really of two different sources on the one hand this woody liana which has in it a series of betacarbolines harmine harmaline mildly hallucinogenic  to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness  but its mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines very close to brain serotonin dimethyltryptamine methoxydimethyltryptamine If youve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity Laughter It doesnt create the distortion of reality it creates the dissolution of reality In fact I used to argue with my professor Richard Evan Shultes  who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the s  I used to argue that you couldnt classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time youre under the effects theres no one home anymore to experience a hallucination Laughter But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because theyre denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO Now the fascinating things are that the betacarbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine So you ask yourself a question How in a flora of  species of vascular plants do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts Well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless But you ask the Indians and they say The plants talk to us Well what does that mean This tribe the Cofan has  varieties of ayahuasca all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referable to our eye as one species And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say I thought you knew something about plants I mean dont you know anything And I said No Well it turns out you take each of the  varieties in the night of a full moon and it sings to you in a different key Now thats not going to get you a PhD at Harvard but its a lot more interesting than counting stamens Laughter Now  Applause  the problem  the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world meaning our world moves on Well the truth is the th century  years from now is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet Now the problem isnt change All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life And the problem is not technology itself The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy Its not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere It is power the crude face of domination Wherever you look around the world you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to whether its the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan  a nomadic people from Southeast Asia from Sarawak  a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest  or in the case of the Yanomami its the disease entities that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet where Im doing a lot of research recently youll see its a crude face of political domination You know genocide the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned but ethnocide the destruction of peoples way of life is not only not condemned its universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level I once travelled  miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about  sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes  million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution This young mans father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldnt bear to be without him The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold And in the end then it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity Margaret Mead the great anthropologist said before she died that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities And its humbling to remember that our species has perhaps been around for  years The Neolithic Revolution  which gave us agriculture at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood we created hierarchy specialization surplus  is only  years ago The modern industrial world as we know it is barely  years old Now that shallow history doesnt suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human they respond with  different voices And its within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are a fully conscious species fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish And there are great moments of optimism This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people and this man Olayuk told me a marvelous story of his grandfather The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people and during the s to establish our sovereignty we forced them into settlements This old mans grandfather refused to go The family fearful for his life took away all of his weapons all of his tools Now you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold they took advantage of it The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide So this mans grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing He simply slipped outside pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand And as the feces began to freeze he shaped it into the form of a blade He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid he butchered a dog with it He skinned the dog and improvised a harness took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled harnessed up an adjacent dog and disappeared over the ice floes shit knife in belt Talk about getting by with nothing Laughter And this in many ways  Applause  is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world The Canadian government in April of  gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together Its our new homeland Its called Nunavut Its an independent territory They control all mineral resources An amazing example of how a nationstate can seek restitution with its people And finally in the end I think its pretty obvious at least to all of all us whove traveled in these remote reaches of the planet to realize that theyre not remote at all Theyre homelands of somebody They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time And for all of us the dreams of these children like the dreams of our own children become part of the naked geography of hope So what were trying to do at the National Geographic finally is we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything We think that polemics  Applause  we think that polemics are not persuasive but we think that storytelling can change the world and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world We get  million hits on our website every month  nations carry our television channel Our magazines are read by millions And what were doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where were going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen and hopefully therefore embrace gradually one by one the central revelation of anthropology that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective wellbeing Thank you very much ,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

70,"This is really a twohour presentation
I give to high school students cut down to three minutes And it all started one day
on a plane on my way to TED seven years ago And in the seat next to me
was a high school student a teenager and she came from a really poor family And she wanted to make
something of her life and she asked me a simple little question She said What leads to success And I felt really badly because I couldnt give her a good answer So I get off the plane and I come to TED And I think jeez Im in the middle
of a room of successful people So why dont I ask them
what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids So here we are seven years
 interviews later and Im going to tell you
what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick And the first thing is passion Freeman Thomas says
Im driven by my passion TEDsters do it for love
they dont do it for money Carol Coletta says I would pay
someone to do what I do And the interesting thing is if you do it for love
the money comes anyway Work Rupert Murdoch said
to me Its all hard work Nothing comes easily
But I have a lot of fun Did he say fun Rupert Yes TEDsters do have fun working
And they work hard I figured theyre not workaholics
Theyre workafrolics Good Alex Garden says To be successful
put your nose down in something and get damn good at it Theres no magic
its practice practice practice And its focus Norman Jewison said to me I think it all has to do
with focusing yourself on one thing And push David Gallo says Push yourself Physically mentally
youve got to push push push Youve got to push through shyness
and selfdoubt Goldie Hawn says
I always had selfdoubts I wasnt good enough
I wasnt smart enough I didnt think Id make it Now its not always easy to push yourself and thats why they invented mothers Frank Gehry said to me My mother pushed me Serve Sherwin Nuland says
It was a privilege to serve as a doctor A lot of kids want to be millionaires The first thing I say is OK well you cant serve yourself youve got to serve others
something of value Because thats the way
people really get rich Ideas TEDster Bill Gates says I had an idea founding the first microcomputer
software company Id say it was a pretty good idea And theres no magic to creativity
in coming up with ideas  its just doing some very simple things And I give lots of evidence Persist Joe Kraus says Persistence is the number
one reason for our success Youve got to persist through failure
Youve got to persist through crap Which of course means Criticism
Rejection Assholes and Pressure So the answer to this question is simple Pay  bucks and come to TED Or failing that do
the eight things  and trust me these are the big eight things
that lead to success Thank you TEDsters
for all your interviews ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

71,"Im often asked What surprised you about the book And I say That I got to write it I would have never imagined that Not in my wildest dreams did I think  I dont even consider
myself to be an author And Im often asked Why do you think so many
people have read this This things selling still
about a million copies a month And I think its because
spiritual emptiness is a universal disease I think inside at some point we put
our heads down on the pillow and we go Theres got to be more
to life than this Get up in the morning go to work
come home and watch TV go to bed get up in the morning go
to work come home watch TV go to bed go to parties on weekends A lot of people say Im living No
youre not living  thats just existing Just existing I really think that
theres this inner desire I do believe what Chris said
I believe that youre not an accident Your parents may not have planned you
but I believe God did I think there are accidental parents
theres no doubt about that I dont think there are accidental kids And I think you matter I think you matter to God
I think you matter to history I think you matter to this universe And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level
of living the success level of living and the significance level of living is Do you figure out
What on Earth am I here for I meet a lot of people who are very smart and say But why cant I
figure out my problems And I meet a lot of people
who are very successful who say Why dont I feel more fulfilled Why do I feel like a fake Why do I feel like Ive got to pretend
that Im more than I really am I think that comes down to this issue
of meaning of significance of purpose I think it comes down to this issue of Why am I here What am I here for
Where am I going These are not religious issues Theyre human issues I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke
that I really appreciate what he does because it makes my life work
a whole lot easier As a pastor I do see a lot of kooks And I have learned that there are
kooks in every area of life Religion doesnt have a monopoly on that but there are plenty of religious kooks There are secular kooks
there are smart kooks dumb kooks There are people  a lady
came up to me the other day and she had a white piece of paper 
Michael youll like this one  and she said What do you see in it And I looked at it and I said
Oh I dont see anything And she goes Well I see Jesus
and started crying and left Im going OK you know Fine Good for you When the book became the bestselling book
in the world for the last three years I kind of had my little crisis And that was What is the purpose of this Because it brought in
enormous amounts of money When you write the bestselling
book in the world its tons and tons of money And it brought in a lot of attention
neither of which I wanted When I started Saddleback Church
I was  years old I started it with
one other family in  And I decided that I was never
going to go on TV because I didnt want to be a celebrity I didnt want to be a quote
evangelist televangelist  thats not my thing And all of the sudden it brought a lot
of money and a lot of attention I dont think  now this is a worldview and I will tell you
everybodys got a worldview Everybodys betting
their life on something Youre betting your life on something you just better know why
youre betting what youre betting on So everybodys betting
their life on something And when I you know made a bet I happened to believe
that Jesus was who he said he was And I believe in a pluralistic society everybodys betting on something And when I started the church you know I had no plans
to do what its doing now And then when I wrote this book and all of a sudden it just took off and I started saying now
whats the purpose of this Because as I started to say I dont think youre given money or fame for your own ego ever I just dont believe that And when you write a book
that the first sentence of the book is Its not about you then when all of a sudden it becomes
the bestselling book in history youve got to figure well
I guess its not about me Thats kind of a nobrainer So what is it for And I began to think about what I call
the stewardship of affluence and the stewardship of influence So I believe essentially
leadership is stewardship That if you are a leader in any area  in business in politics
in sports in art in academics in any area  you dont own it You are a steward of it For instance thats why I believe
in protecting the environment This is not my planet It wasnt mine before I was born
its not going to be mine after I die Im just here for  years
and then thats it I was debating
the other day on a talk show and the guy was challenging
me and hed go Whats a pastor doing
on protecting the environment And I asked this guy I said
Well do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better
place for the next generation Do you think we have a stewardship here
to take the environment seriously And he said No I said Oh you dont I said Let me make this clear again Do you believe that as human beings 
Im not talking about religion  do you believe that as human beings
it is our responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better
for the next generation And he said No Not any more
than any other species When he said the word species
he was revealing his worldview And he was saying Im no more responsible to take care
of this environment than a duck is Well now I know a lot
of times we act like ducks but youre not a duck Youre not a duck And you are responsible 
thats my worldview And so you need to understand
what your worldview is The problem is most people
never really think it through They never really  codify it or qualify it or quantify it and say This is what I believe in
This is why I believe what I believe I dont personally have
enough faith to be an atheist But you may you may Your worldview though does determine
everything else in your life because it determines your decisions it determines your relationships it determines your level of confidence It determines really
everything in your life What we believe obviously  and you know this 
determines our behavior and our behavior determines
what we become in life So all of this money started pouring in and all of this fame started pouring in And Im going what do I do with this My wife and I first made five decisions
on what to do with the money We said First were not
going to use it on ourselves I didnt go out and buy a bigger house I dont own a guesthouse I still drive the same four yearold
Ford that Ive driven We just said were not
going to use it on us The second thing was I stopped taking a salary
from the church that I pastor Third thing is I added up
all that the church had paid me over the last  years
and I gave it back And I gave it back because
I didnt want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money  I dont In fact personally Ive never met a priest or a pastor or a minister
who does it for money I know thats the stereotype
Ive never met one of them Believe me theres a whole lot
easier ways to make money Pastors are like on  hoursaday call
theyre like doctors I left late today  Id hoped
to be here yesterday  because my fatherinlaw
is in his last probably  hours before he dies of cancer And Im watching a guy
whos lived his life  hes now in his mids 
and hes dying with peace You know the test of your worldview
is not how you act in the good times The test of your worldview
is how you act at the funeral And having been through literally
hundreds if not thousands of funerals it makes a difference It makes a difference what you believe So we gave it all back and then we set up three foundations working on some of the major
problems of the world illiteracy poverty pandemic diseases 
particularly HIVAIDS  and set up these three foundations
and put the money into that The last thing we did is we became
what I call reverse tithers And that is when my wife
and I got married  years ago we started tithing Now thats a principle in the Bible that says give  percent
of what you get back to charity give it away to help other people So we started doing that and each year
we would raise our tithe one percent So our first year of marriage
we went to  percent second year we went to  percent and the third year we went to  percent and on and on and on Why did I do that Because every time I give it breaks the grip
of materialism in my life Materialism is all about getting 
get get get get all you can can all you get sit on the can
and spoil the rest Its all about more having more And we think that the good life
is actually looking good  thats most important of all  looking good feeling good
and having the goods But thats not the good life I meet people all the time who have
those and theyre not necessarily happy If money actually made you happy then the wealthiest people
in the world would be the happiest And that I know personally
I know is not true Its just not true So the good life is not about looking
good feeling good or having the goods its about being good and doing good Giving your life away Significance in life
doesnt come from status because you can always find
somebody whos got more than you It doesnt come from sex It doesnt come from salary It comes from serving It is in giving our lives away
that we find meaning we find significance Thats the way we were wired
I believe by God And so we began to give away and now after  years my wife and I are reverse tithers 
we give away  percent and live on  That actually was the easy part The hard part is what do I do
with all this attention Because I started getting
all kinds of invitations I just came off a nearly
monthlong speaking tour on three different continents and I wont go into that but it was an amazing thing And Im going what do I do
with this notoriety that the book has brought And being a pastor
I started reading the Bible Theres a chapter in the Bible
called Psalm  and its Solomons prayer
for more influence When you read this prayer it sounds incredibly
selfish selfcentered He says God I want you
to make me famous Thats what he prays He said I want you to make me famous I want you to spread the fame
of my name through every land I want you to give me power I want you to make me famous
I want you to give me influence And it just sounds like the most
egotistical request you could make if you were going to pray Until you read the whole psalm
the whole chapter And then he says
So that the king   he was the king of Israel
at that time at its apex in power   so that the king may care
for the widow and orphan support the oppressed defend
the defenseless care for the sick assist the poor
speak up for the foreigner those in prison Basically hes talking about
all the marginalized in society And as I read that I looked at it and I thought you know what this is saying is that the purpose
of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence The purpose of influence
is not to build your ego Or your net worth And by the way your net worth is not
the same thing as your selfworth Your value is not based on your valuables Its based on a whole
different set of things And so the purpose
of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence And I had to admit I cant think of the last time
I thought of widows and orphans Theyre not on my radar I pastor a church in one of the most
affluent areas of America  a bunch of gated communities I have a church full
of CEOs and scientists And I could go five years and never
ever see a homeless person Theyre just not in my pathway Now theyre  miles
up the road in Santa Ana So I had to say ok I would use whatever affluence
and whatever influence Ive got to help those who dont have
either of those You know theres a story
in the Bible about Moses whether you believe its true or not
it really doesnt matter to me But Moses if you saw the movie
The Ten Commandments Moses goes out and theres this
burning bush and God talks to him and God says
Moses whats in your hand I think thats one of the most important
questions youll ever be asked Whats in your hand Moses says Its a staff
Its a shepherds staff And God says Throw it down And if you saw the movie you know
he throws it down and it becomes a snake And then God says Pick it up And he picks it back up again and it becomes a staff again Now Im reading this thing
and Im going what is that all about OK Whats that all about Well
I do know a couple of things Number one God never does
a miracle to show off Its not just Wow isnt that cool And by the way my God doesnt
have to show up on cheese bread You know if Gods going to show up
hes not going to show up on cheese bread Ok I just this is why I love
what Michael does because its like if hes debunking it
then I dont have to But God  my God 
doesnt show up on sprinkler images Hes got a few more powerful ways
than that to do whatever he wants to do But he doesnt do miracles
just to show off Second thing is
if God ever asks you a question he already knows the answer Obviously if hes God
then that would mean that when he asks the question
its for your benefit not his So hes going Whats in your hand Now what was in Moses hand Well it was a shepherds staff
Now follow me on this This staff represented
three things about Moses life First it represented his identity
he was a shepherd Its the symbol of his own occupation I am a shepherd Its a symbol of his identity
his career his job Second its a symbol
of not only his identity its a symbol of his income because all
of his assets are tied up in sheep In those days nobody had bank accounts
or American Express cards or hedge funds Your assets are tied up in your flocks So its a symbol of his identity
and its a symbol of his income And the third thing
its a symbol of his influence What do you do with a shepherds staff Well you know you move sheep
from point A to point B with it by hook or by crook You pull them or you poke them
One or the other So hes saying Youre going to lay down your identity Whats in your hand Youve got identity youve got income
youve got influence Whats in your hand And hes saying If you lay it down
Ill make it come alive Ill do some things
you could never imagine possible And if youve watched that movie
Ten Commandments all of those big miracles that happen
in Egypt are done through this staff Last year I was invited to speak
at the NBA AllStars game And so Im talking to the players because most of the NBA teams
NFL teams and all the other teams have done this  Days of Purpose
based on the book And I asked them I said
Whats in your hand So whats in your hand
I said Its a basketball And that basketball represents
your identity who you are youre an NBA player It represents your income youre making a lot of money
off that little ball And it represents your influence And even though youre only going
to be in the NBA for a few years youre going to be an NBA player
for the rest of your life And that gives you enormous influence So what are you going to do
with what youve been given And I guess thats the main reason
I came up here today to all of you very bright people at TED  it is to say Whats in your hand What do you have that youve been given Talent background education freedom networks opportunities wealth ideas creativity What are you doing
with what youve been given That to me is the primary
question about life That to me is what being
purposedriven is all about In the book I talk about
how youre wired to do certain things youre SHAPED with  a little acrostic
Spiritual gifts Heart Ability Personality and Experiences These things shape you And if you want to know what you ought
to be doing with your life you need to look at your shape 
What am I wired to do Why would God wire you to do something
and then not have you do it If youre wired to be an anthropologist
youll be an anthropologist If youre wired to be
an undersea explorer youll be an undersea explorer If youre wired to make deals
you make deals If youre wired to paint you paint Did you know that God smiles
when you be you When my little kids 
when my kids were little  theyre all grown now I have grandkids  I used to go in and sit
on the side of their bed and I used to watch my kids sleep And I just watched their little bodies
rise and lower rise and lower And I would look at them
This is not an accident Rise and lower And I got joy out of just
watching them sleep Some people have the misguided idea
that God only gets excited when youre doing quote
spiritual things like going to church or helping the poor or you know confessing
or doing something like that The bottom line is God gets pleasure
watching you be you Why He made you And when you do what you were made to do he goes Thats my boy Thats my girl Youre using the talent
and ability that I gave you So my advice to you is look at whats in your hand  your identity your influence
your income  and say Its not about me Its about making the world
a better place Thank you ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

72,Id like to speak about technology trends which is something that many of you follow  but we also follow for related reasons Obviously being a technology magazine technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about But also its part of being any monthly magazine  you live in the future And we have a long leadtime We have to plan issues many months in advance we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months nine months down the road So were in the forecasting business We also like a lot of companies create a product thats based on technology trends In this case ours is about ideas and information and if were lucky some entertainment But the concepts quite the same And so we have to understand not only why techs important where its going but also very importantly when  the timing is everything And its interesting when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the s about ecommerce or Internet traffic or broadband adoption or Internet advertising they were all right  they were just wrong in time Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later But the difference of a few years on stockmarket valuations is obviously extreme And thats why timing is everything Youve probably seen something like this before This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technologys lifespan And just for fun we put a bunch of technologies on it to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment or rise back in the slope of enlightenment etc And this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important well typically do it twice Once we want to do it first We want to be the first to do it for the geeks who appreciate that well catch it right there at the technologytrigger You can see in  we put Linux on the cover But then it comes back And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream and theyre going to burst out And then its time to do it again Last year And thats one way that we try to time technology trends Id like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but its closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future Its based on the presumption the observation even that all important technologies go through four stages in their life  at least one of the four stages sometimes all four of the stages And at each one of these stages can be seen as a collision  a collision with something else  for example a critical priceline that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world Its an inflection point And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technologys life is going to be and maybe how you can do something about it The first is the critical price The first stage in a technologys advance is that itll fall below a critical price After it falls below a critical price it will tend if its successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration Many technologies at that point displace another technology and thats another important point And then finally a lot of technologies commoditize Towards the end of their life they become nearly free Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it its an opportunity for the technology to change And even if you missed you know the first boom of WiFi  you know WiFi did the critical price it did the critical mass but hasnt done displacement yet and hasnt done free yet  theres still more opportunity in that Id like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD which is a technology which has done all of these The DVD as you know was introduced in the mids and it was quite expensive But you can see that by  it had fallen below  dollars and  dollars was a psychological threshold And it started to take off And you can see that the units started to trend up the hidden inflection point  it was taking off The next thing it hit a year later was critical mass In this case  percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household And whats interesting here is that something else took off along with it hometheater units Suddenly you have a DVD in the house youve got highquality digital video you have a reason to have a bigscreen television you have a reason for Dolby  surroundsound And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them and bring the rest of your entertainment in Whats interesting also is  note that Netflix was founded in  Reed Hastings is here He clearly saw that that was a moment that was an inflection point that he could do something with The next phase it hit was displacement You can see around  it finally outsold the VCR And here too you can see the implications in the world at large Netflix was right  the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the videorental stores couldnt Among the DVDs many assets is that its very small you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply That gave an advantage that was an implication of the technologys rise that wasnt obvious to everybody And then finally DVDs are approaching free Theres a company called Apex a noname Chinese firm who has several times in the past year been the numberone DVD seller in America Their average price for last year was  dollars Youre aware of the perhaps apocryphal WalMart stampede over the dollar DVD But theyre getting very very cheap and look at the interesting implication of it As they get cheaper the premium brands the Sonys and such are losing market share and the nonames the Apexes are gaining them Theyre being commodified and thats what happens when things go to zero Its a tough market out there Now theyve introduced these four ways of looking at technology these four stages of technologys life Id like to talk about some other technologies out there just technologies on our radar  and Ill use this lens these four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development Theyre not necessarily the top technologies out there  theyre just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers these intersections are interesting to think about Start with gene sequencing As you probably know gene sequencing  in a large part because its built on computers  is falling in price at a kind of a Moores Lawlike level It is now possible  will be possible and if Craig Venter indeed comes today he may tell you something about this  to sequence the human genome for  million dollars by the end of this year Thats as opposed to billions just a few years ago You know our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer Whats interesting is that at the same time the number of genes that were discovering is rising very quickly Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done very cheaply if you want to know You can learn about your own mosaic Heres another technology thats approaching a critical price This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on antiretroviral drug compounds and cocktails In January  the price was  dollars or  dollars a day The generics came in first in Brazil and elsewhere and the effect was just dramatic on pricing Today its less than  cents a day And whats interesting is if you look at the price elasticity if you look at the correlation between these two as the antiretrovirals come down the number of people you can treat goes radically up And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by   two million in subSaharan Africa And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that Linux is another good example Now weve switched to critical mass These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass If you look here heres Linux in red and its hit  percent Interestingly its done a crossover before but not the crossovers that matter The crossover thats going to matter is the one with the blue But you can look and see the direction those lines are going you can see that at the  percent its now taken seriously Its not just for the geeks any more That is I imagine what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars I dont know whether anybody has a Prius  but theyre fantastic And if you look at the trends here by about   and I dont think this is a crazy forecast  theyll be two percent of auto sales Two percent isnt  percent but in the car business which is slow moving thats huge thats arrival At two percent you start seeing them on the roads everywhere And whats interesting about the hybrids taking off is youve now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry Its the first radical change in automobile technology in  years And once you have electric motors you can do anything you can change the structure of the car in any way you want You can have regenerative braking you can have drivebywire you can have replaceable body shapes  its a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about Again its kind of coming out of nowhere its a little hard to use right now Theres a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype Look at these numbers They launched it in August of last year they already have nearly four million registered users  thats critical mass And the same things happening on the carrier side Youre looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards This is a tipping point  if Malcolms here forgive me  and its going to change the economics and the speed and the players in the industry Its going to look a little bit like that And finally free Free is really really interesting Free is something that comes with digital because the reproduction costs are essentially free It comes with IP because its such an efficient protocol It comes with fiber optics because theres so much bandwidth Free is really you know the gift of Silicon Valley to the world Its an economic force its a technical force Its a deflationary force if not handled right It is abundance as opposed to scarcity Free is probably the most interesting thing And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive You know there could be a films unclear there but its basically every song ever made could be stored on  dollars worth of storage by  It takes that entire element the physical element of songs off the table And youve seen the numbers I mean you know the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes and Hollywoods worried as well Theyre facing a force that they havent faced before And their response is draconian and not necessarily the one thats going to get them out of this And finally Ill give you one last example of free  perhaps the most powerful of all I mentioned fiber optics  their abundance tends to make things free This is the price of a phone call to India per minute And whats interesting is that it was just  when it was more than two dollars a minute India had still has a regulated phone system and so did we It was surprisingly noninnovative moved very slowly but then there was just so much fiber out there you couldnt hold back and look how quickly the price fell Its seven cents a minute in many cases And the consequence of cheap phone calling free phone calling to India is the pissedoff programmer is the outsourcing It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that were seeing in our world today The force of India and then China and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies  because the communications are free  is just beginning to be felt And I think thats probably one of the most important technology trends that were looking at today Thank you

73,"What Id like to start off with is an observation which is that if Ive learned anything over the last year its that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book in really tiny bitesize chunks Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly So  so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air And I think that  thats not really surprising though is it Because thats kind of the world that we live in now a world stuck in fastforward A world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher which is in my bio there Ill just toss it out again  These days even instant gratification takes too long Laughter And if you think about how we to try to make things better what do we do No we speed them up dont we So we used to dial now we speed dial We used to read now we speed read We used to walk now we speed walk And of course we used to date and now we speed date And even things that are by their very nature slow  we try and speed them up too So I was in New York recently and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course a new evening course And it was for you guessed it speed yoga So this  the perfect solution for timestarved professionals who want to you know salute the sun but only want to give over about  minutes to it I mean these are sort of the extreme examples and theyre amusing and good to laugh at But theres a very serious point and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us Were so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives  on our health our diet our work our relationships the environment and our community And sometimes it takes a wakeup call doesnt it to alert us to the fact that were hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them that were living the fast life instead of the good life And I think for many people that wakeup call takes the form of an illness You know a burnout or eventually the body says I cant take it anymore and throws in the towel Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we havent had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them And my wakeup call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son and I found that at the end of day I would go into his room and I just couldnt slow down  you know Id be speed reading The Cat In The Hat Id be  you know Id be skipping lines here paragraphs there sometimes a whole page and of course my little boy knew the book inside out so we would quarrel And what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to his son became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between my speed and his slowness And this went on for some time until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people And one of them made reference to a series of books called The OneMinute Bedtime Story And I wince saying those words now but my first reaction at the time was very different My first reflex was to say Hallelujah  what a great idea This is exactly what Im looking for to speed up bedtime even more But thankfully a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and I took a step back and I thought Whoa  you know has it really come to this Am I really in such a hurry that Im prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day And I put away the newspaper  and I was getting on a plane  and I sat there and I did something I hadnt done for a long time  which is I did nothing I just thought and I thought long and hard And by the time I got off that plane Id decided I wanted to do something about it I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture and what it was doing to me and to everyone else And I had two questions in my head The first was how did we get so fast And the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down Now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads You think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology But I think if you cut through those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself In other cultures time is cyclical Its seen as moving in great unhurried circles Its always renewing and refreshing itself Whereas in the West time is linear Its a finite resource its always draining away You either use it or lose it Time is money as Benjamin Franklin said And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation Time is scarce so what do we do Well  well we speed up dont we We try and do more and more with less and less time We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line  a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless And I guess that the question is is it possible to break free from that mindset And thankfully the answer is yes because what I discovered when I began looking around that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best Right across the world people are doing the unthinkable theyre slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down youre road kill the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better They eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better And in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the International Slow Movement Now if youll permit me a small act of hypocrisy Ill just give you a very quick overview of whats going on inside the Slow Movement If you think of food many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement Started in Italy but has spread across the world and now has  members in  countries And its driven by a very simple and sensible message which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement and the renaissance of farmers markets are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable They want to get back to slower rhythms And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement which has started in Italy but has spread right across Europe and beyond And in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another So they might curb traffic or put in a park bench or some green space And in some ways these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City its kind of like a philosophical declaration Its saying to the rest of world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the st century 
slowness has a role to play In medicine I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quickfix mentality you find in conventional medicine And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing Now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit And bluechip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work and what we might learn from them Sex Theres an awful lot of fast sex around isnt there I was coming to  well  no pun intended there I was making my way lets say slowly to Oxford and I went through a news agent and I saw a magazine a mens magazine and it said on the front How to bring your partner to orgasm in  seconds So you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days Now you know I like a quickie as much as the next person but I think that theres an awful lot to be gained from slow sex  from slowing down in the bedroom You know you tap into that  those deeper sort of psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm with the buildup You can get more bang for your buck lets say I mean the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently didnt they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand Now we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric but you fastforward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex And of course in Italy where  I mean Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure  theyve launched an official Slow Sex movement The workplace Right across much of the world  North America being a notable exception  working hours have been coming down And Europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as theyre working less and also that their hourly productivity goes up Now clearly there are problems with the hour workweek in France  too much too soon too rigid But other countries in Europe notably the Nordic countries are showing that its possible to have a kickass economy without being a workaholic And Norway Sweden Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy And if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the microcompany level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug  to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops  you at the back  mobile phones during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought Its not just though these days adults who overwork though is it Its children too Im  and my childhood ended in the mids and I look at kids now and Im just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me to write to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this fullthrottle treadmill But thankfully there is a backlash there in parenting as well and youre finding that you know towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month so that people can you know decompress and have some family time and slow down Homework is another thing There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years and now theyre discovering that less can be more So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a feepaying highachieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of  and the highachieving parents freaked out and said What are you  you know our kids will fall  the headmaster said No no your children need to slow down at the end of the day And just this last month the exam results came in and in math science marks went up  percent on average last year And I think whats very revealing is that the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling These kids have wonderful marks they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars to the point that would make your eyes water But they lack spark they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside  they dont know how to dream And so what these Ivy League schools and Oxford and Cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit And in Harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates  freshmen  telling them that theyll get more out of life and more out of Harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them And even if they sometimes do nothing at all And that letter is called  very revealing I think  Slow Down  with an exclamation mark on the end So wherever you look the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often better But that said of course its not that easy to slow down is it I mean you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and thats true but thats not all of it I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time And if thats not shaming enough I got that ticket in Italy And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway youll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going But why is it so hard to slow down I think there are various reasons One is that speed is fun you know speed is sexy Its all that adrenaline rush Its hard to give it up I think theres a kind of metaphysical dimension  that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions We fill our head with distraction with busyness so that we dont have to ask am I well Am I happy Are my children growing up right Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf Another reason  although I think perhaps the most powerful reason  why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that weve erected against slowing down Slow is a dirty word in our culture Its a byword for lazy slacker for being somebody who gives up You know hes a bit slow Its actually synonymous with being stupid I guess what the Slow Movement  the purpose of the Slow Movement or its main goal really is to tackle that taboo and to say that yes sometimes slow is not the answer that there is such a thing as bad slow You know I got stuck on the M which is a ring road around London recently and spent threeandahalf hours there And I can tell you thats really bad slow But the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the Slow Movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too And good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the TV switched off Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life Now one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff thats happened around the book since it came out is the reaction to it And I knew that when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade but its also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world  you know business press but also big companies and leadership organizations Because people at the top of the chain people like you I think are starting to realize that theres too much speed in the system theres too much busyness and its time to find or get back to that lost art of shifting gears Another encouraging sign I think is that its not just in the developed world that this ideas been taken up In the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status  China Brazil Thailand Poland and so on  these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement many people in them and theres a debate going on in their media on the streets Because I think theyre looking at the West and theyre saying Well we like that aspect of what youve got but were not so sure about that So all of that said is it I guess is it possible Thats really the main question before us today Is it possible to slow down And Im happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes And I present myself as Exhibit A a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speedaholic I still love speed You know I live in London and I work as a journalist and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things I play squash and ice hockey two very fast sports and I wouldnt give them up for the world But Ive also over the last year or so got in touch with my inner tortoise And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously My default mode is no longer to be a rushaholic I no longer hear times winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as I did before I can actually hear it now because I see my time is ticking off And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than I ever have I feel like Im living my life rather than actually just racing through it And perhaps the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer stronger And for me I guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because thats sort of where the journey began And there too the news is rosy You know at the end of the day I go into my sons room I dont wear a watch I switch off my computer so I cant hear the email pinging into the basket and I just slow down to his pace and we read And because children have their own tempo and internal clock they dont do quality time where you schedule  minutes for them to open up to you They need you to move at their rhythm I find that  minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say You know something happened in the playground today that really bothered me And well go off and have a conversation on that And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my todo list something that I dreaded because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly Its become my reward at the end of the day something I really cherish And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this a few months ago I was getting ready to go on another book tour and I had my bags packed I was downstairs by the front door and I was waiting for a taxi and my son came down the stairs and hed made a card for me And he was carrying it Hed gone and stapled two cards very like these together and put a sticker of his favorite character Tintin on the front And he said to me or he handed this to me and I read it and it said To Daddy love Benjamin And I thought Aw thats really sweet Is that a good luck on the book tour card And he said No no no Daddy  this is a card for being the best story reader in the world And I thought Yeah you know this slowing down thing really does work Thank you very much ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

74,When Im starting talks like this I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there dont know what that is This is a crowd that does know what it is so Ill like just do like the second cribnote version Right So just bear with me Well go real fast you know Fill in the blanks So you know sustainability small planet Right Picture a little Earth circling around the sun You know about a million years ago a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees got a little clever harnessed fire invented the printing press made you know luggage with wheels on it And you know built the society that we now live in Unfortunately while this society is without a doubt the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created its got some major major flaws One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint It has an amount of impact on the planet thats measurable How much stuff goes through your life how much waste is left behind you And we at the moment in our society have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this Were using up about five planets If everybody on the planet lived the way we did wed need between five six seven some people even say  planets to make it Clearly we dont have  planets Again you know mental visual  planets one planet  planets one planet Right We dont have that So thats one problem The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways Right North Americans such as myself you know were basically sort of wallowing gluttonous hogs and were eating all sorts of stuff And you know then you get all the way down to people who live in the AsiaPacific region or even more Africa And people simply do not have enough to survive This is producing all sorts of tensions all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing And theres more and more people on the way Right So this is what the planets going to look like in  years Its going to be a pretty crowded place at least eight billion people So to make matters even more difficult its a very young planet A third of the people on this planet are kids And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did no matter where they live Theyve been exposed to this idea of our society of our prosperity And they may not want to live exactly like us They may not want to be Americans or Brits or Germans or South Africans but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous and more dynamic and more you know enjoyable And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situations which are simply unthinkable Everybody in this room has heard the worstcase scenarios I dont need to go into that But I will ask the question whats the alternative And I would say that at the moment the alternative is unimaginable You know so on the one hand we have the unthinkable on the other hand we have the unimaginable We dont know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable which is shareable with everybody on the planet which promotes stability and democracy and human rights and which is achievable in the timeframe necessary to make it through the challenges we face We dont know how to do this yet So whats Worldchanging Well Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future You know what were out there doing is looking for examples of tools models and ideas which if widely adopted would change the game A lot of times when I do a talk like this I talk about things that everybody in this room Im sure has already heard of but most people havent So I thought today Id do something a little different and talk about what were looking for rather than saying you know rather than giving you triedandtrue examples Talk about the kinds of things were scoping out Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook And given that I have  minutes to do this this is going to go kind of quick So I dont know just stick with me Right So first of all what are we looking for Bright Green city One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities Were already an urban planet thats especially true in the developed world And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous and thus use a lot of stuff If we can change the dynamic by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable  Here for example is Vancouver which if you havent been there you ought to go for a visit Its a fabulous city And they are doing density new density better than probably anybody else on the planet right now Theyre actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars which is a pretty great thing So you have density You also have growth management You leave aside what is natural to be natural This is in Portland That is an actual development That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity Theyve bounded the city with a line Nature city Nothing changes Once you do those things you can start making all sorts of investments You can start doing things like you know transit systems that actually work to transport people in effective and reasonably comfortable manners You can also start to change what you build This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London which is one of the greenest buildings in the world Its a fabulous place Were able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity that recycle much of their water that are much more comfortable than standard buildings use allnatural light etc and over time cost less Green roofs Bill McDonough covered that last night so I wont dwell on that too much But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other one of the things you can do is  as information technologies develop  you can start to have smart places You can start to know where things are When you know where things are it becomes easier to share them When you share them you end up using less So one great example is carshare clubs which are really starting to take off in the US have already taken off in many places in Europe and are a great example If youre somebody who drives you know one day a week do you really need your own car Another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing and by monitoring the amount were actually using So heres a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use which I think is a pretty cool concept although I think it ought to work the other way around that it gets brighter the more you dont use But you know there may even be a simpler approach We could just relabel things This light switch that reads on the one hand flashfloods and on the other hand off How we build things can change as well This is a biomorphic building It takes its inspiration in form from life Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful and also much more effective This is an example of biomimicry which is something were really starting to look a lot more for In this case you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan which is greatly more effective Theres a lot of this stuff happening its really pretty remarkable I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if youre into it Were starting to cover this more and more Theres also neobiological design where more and more were actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry So this for example is hydrogengenerating algae So we have a model in potential an emerging model that were looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in and turn them into Bright Green cities But unfortunately most of the people on the planet dont live in the cites we live in They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world And theres a statistic I often like to use which is that were adding a city of Seattle every four days a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days I was giving a talk about two months ago and this guy whod done some work with the UN came up to me and was really flustered and he said look youve got that totally wrong its totally wrong Its every seven days So were adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly They dont have existing infrastructure they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities Well the first thing we need is we need leapfrogging And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere The idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person or a country who is stuck in a situation where you dont have the tools and technologies that you need theres no reason for you to invest in last generations technologies Right That youre much better off almost universally looking for a lowcost or locally applicable version of the newest technology One place were all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones Right All throughout the developing world people are going directly to cell phones skipping the whole landline stage If there are landlines in many developing world cities theyre usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money So I rather like this picture here I particularly like the Ganesh in the background talking on the cell phone So what we have increasingly is cell phones just permeating out through society Weve heard all about this here this week so I wont say too much more than that other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies The second thing is tools for collaboration be they systems of collaboration or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration Right When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate you get different kinds of solutions And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who dont have capital Right So you know we have open source software we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions And those things lead to things like this This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software cheap sort of hackedtogether machines and basically sort of abandoned buildings  has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in get highspeed internet access learn computer programming skills for free And a quartermillion people every year use these now in Sao Paulo And those quartermillion people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back Laughter So one of the things that thats leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion And one of the things were really really interested in at Worldchanging is the ways in which the south is reidentifying itself and recategorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room So its not you know Bollywood isnt just answering Hollywood Right You know Brazilian music scene isnt just answering the major labels Its doing something new Theres new things happening Theres interplay between them And you know you get amazing things Like I dont know if any of you have seen the movie City of God Yeah its a fabulous movie if you havent seen it And its all about this question in a very artistic and indirect kind of way You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda And who are waving their first books in the air which I just think thats a pretty cool picture You know So you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways in ways that havent happened before And as we heard last night as weve heard earlier this week are absolutely fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions is weve got to craft new political realities And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities not only in places like India Afghanistan Kenya Pakistan what have you but here at home as well Another world is possible And sort of the big motto of the antiglobalization movement Right We tweak that a lot We talk about how another world isnt just possible another worlds here That its not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different vague possibility out there but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility We need to start doing things like Lula President of Brazil How many people knew of Lula before today OK so much much better than the average crowd I can tell you that So Lula hes full of problems full of contradictions but one of the things that hes doing is he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of northsouth dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration I would keep your eye on this fellow Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call serious play Were looking a lot at this This is spreading everywhere This is from A Force More Powerful Its a little screenshot A Force More Powerful is a video game that while youre playing it it teaches you how to engage in nonviolent insurrection and regime change Laughter Heres another one This is from a game called Food Force which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in especially in the developing world in peoples interest in and passion for democracy We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer freer more democratic less corrupt And you know we dont hear those stories enough But its happening all over the place and these tools are part of whats making it possible Now when you add all those things together when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools you know second superpower stuff etc what do you get Well very quickly you get a Bright Green future for the developing world You get for example green power spread throughout the world You get  this is a building in Hyderabad India Its the greenest building in the world You get grassroots solutions things that work for people who have no capital or limited access You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains You get access to distance medicine These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs to access databases that have information that they dont have access to at home in a distant manner You get new tools for people in the developing world These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there for whom nightfall means darkness to have a new means of operating These are refrigerators that require no electricity theyre pot within a pot design And you get water solutions Waters one of the most pressing problems Heres a design for harvesting rainwater thats super cheap and available to people in the developing world Heres a design for distilling water using sunlight Heres a fogcatcher which if you live in a moist junglelike area will distill water from the air thats clean and drinkable Heres a way of transporting water I just love this you know  I mean carrying water is such a drag and somebody just came up with the idea of well what if you rolled it Right I mean thats a great design This is a fabulous invention LifeStraw Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips So you know people who are in desperate straits can get this This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever This is a merrygoround invented by the company Roundabout which pumps water as kids play You know Seriously  give that one a hand its pretty great And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis Right Were expecting to have upwards of  million refugees by the year  because of climate change and political instability How do we help people like that Well theres all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet Some of those designs include models for acting such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps New models for pedagogy for the displaced And we have new tools This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere Does anyone know what this is Audience It detects landmines Alex Steffen Exactly this is a landminedetecting flower If you are living in one of the places where the roughly halfbillion unaccounted for mines are scattered you can fling these seeds out into the field And as they grow up they will grow up around the mines their roots will detect the chemicals in them and where the flowers turn red you dont step Yeah so seeds that could save your life You know I also love it because it seems to me that the example the tools we use to change the world ought to be beautiful in themselves You know that its not just enough to survive Weve got to make something better than what weve got And I think that we will Just to wrap up in the immortal words of HG Wells I think that better things are on the way I think that in fact that all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening I hope that that turns out to be true The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

75,Video Narrator An event seen from one point of view gives one impression Seen from another point of view it gives quite a different impression But its only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand whats going on Sasha Vucinic Its a great clip isnt it And I found that in  seconds it tells more about the power of and importance of independent media than I could say in an hour So I thought that it will be good to start with it And also start with a little bit of statistics According to relevant researchers  percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press Think about that number  percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries The information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information or colors that information does something with it So theyre deprived of understanding their reality That is just to understand how big and important this problem is Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent  percent I think should enjoy it until it lasts You know Sunday morning you flick the paper get your cappuccino Enjoy it while it lasts Because as we heard yesterday countries can lose stars from their flags but they can also lose press freedom as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about But thats totally another and separate topic So I can go back to my story My story starts  the story I want to share  starts in  At that time I was running B the only independent for that matter the only electronic media in the country And I guess we were sharing  we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country operating in hostile environment where government really wants to make your life miserable And there are different ways Yeah it was the usual cocktail a little bit of threats a little bit of friendly advice a little bit of financial police a little bit of text control so you always have somebody who never leaves your office But what they really do which is very powerful and that is what governments in the late s started doing if they dont like independent media companies  you know they threaten your advertisers Once they threaten your advertisers market forces are actually you know destroyed and the advertisers do not want to come  no matter how much does it make sense for them  do not want to come and advertise And you have a problem making ends meet At that time at the beginning of the s we had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really painful for me was remember the beginning of the s Yugoslavia is falling apart We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall in a slowmotion downfall And we all had all of that on tapes We had the ability to understand what was going on We were actually recording history The problem was that we had to retape that history a week later because if we did not we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history So if I gave you that picture I dont want to go too long on that In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time It was still  He was running a media systems organization which is still in business the gentleman is still in business And what did I know at that time about media systems I would think media systems were organizations which means they should help you So I prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans the small one and the big one The small one was I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes so we can keep that archive for the next  years The big plan was to ask him for a dollar loan Because I thought I still maintain that serious and independent media companies are great business And I thought that B will survive and be a great company once Milosevic is gone which turned out to be true Its now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was dollar loan to take us through those hard times To make a long story short the gentleman comes into the office great suit and tie I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be Actually I underestimated the atrocities I have to admit Anyway after that whole big long explanation the only question he had for me  and this is not a joke  is are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson That was really the only question he had He left and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies Its so obvious straight in your face and somebody must have thought of it Somebody must have started something like that And I thought Im just dumb and I cannot find it You know in my defense there was no Google at that time you could not just Google in  So I thought that thats actually my problem Now we go from here fast forward to  I have  I left the country I have a meeting with George Soros trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank And basically what I was saying is very simple You know forget about charity it doesnt work Forget about handouts  dollars do not help anybody What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business Its business anywhere Media business or any other business it needs to be capitalized And what these guys need actually is access to capital So third meeting arguments are pretty well exercised At the end of the meeting he says look it is not going to work you will never see your money back but my foundations will put  dollars so you can test the idea See that it will not work He said Ill give you a rope to hang yourself I knew two things after that meeting First under no circumstances I want to hang myself And second that I have no idea how to make it work You see at the level of a concept it was a great concept But its one thing to have a concept its a totally separate thing to actually make it work So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work Had the wrong idea I thought that we can be a bank You see banks  I dont know if there are any bankers over here I apologize in advance  but its the best job in the world You know you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money You give them more money they repay you that over a time You collect interest and do nothing in between So I thought why dont we get into that business So here we are having our first client brilliant First independent newspaper in Slovakia The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava So heres the daily newspaper that has to be printed  kilometers away from the capital Its a daily newspaper with a deadline of  pm That means that they have no sports they have no latest news circulation goes down Its a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper They come to us with a request for a loan They want to  the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press And we said thats fine lets meet youll bring us your business plan which eventually they did We start the meeting I get these two pieces of paper not like this A format so its much bigger A lot of numbers there A lot of numbers But however you put it you know the numbers do not make any sense And thats the best they could do We were the best that they could do So that is how we understood what our method is Its not a bank We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them  by establishing management systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run a business on one side  while they all know how to run how to create content Just quickly on the results Over these  years  million dollars in affordable financing average interest rate five percent to six percent Lately we are going wild charging seven percent from time to time We do it in  countries of the developing world And here is the most stunning number Return rate  the one that Soros was so worried about   percent  percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time What do we typically finance We finance anything that a media company would need from printing presses to transmitters What is most important is we do it either in form of loans equities lease  whatever is appropriate for you know supporting anybody But what is most important here is who do we finance We believe that in the last  years companies that weve financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world That is a Who is Who list And I could spend hours talking about them because theyre all kind of heroes And I can but Ill give you just maybe one and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe and moved to Russia Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk Ill bet half of you have never heard of that place In the south of Russia theres a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin who is running an independent newspaper there The city was closed until early s because of all things they were producing glass for Tupolev planes Anyway hes running independent newspaper there After two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place Governor comes to him one day actually invites him to come to his office He goes and sees the governor The governor says Boris Nikolayevich I understand you are doing a great job and you are the most respected newspaper in our district And I want to offer you a deal Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months because I have elections  there are elections coming up in nine months I will not run but its very important for me who is going to succeed me So give me the paper for nine months Ill give it back to you I have no interest in being in media business How much would that cost Boris Nikolayevich says Its not for sale The governor says We will close you Boris Nikolayevich says No you cannot do it Six months later the newspaper was closed Luckily we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one to get all the subscription lists rehire staff So what the governor got was an empty shell But that is what happens if youre in business of independent media and if you are a banker for independent media So it sounds like a great story Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center We started our media lab sounds like a real great story But there is a second angle to that The second angle like in this clip If you take the camera above you start thinking about these numbers again  million dollars over  years spread over  countries That is not too much is it Its actually just a drop in the sea Because when you think about the importance some of the issues that we were talking about last night  this last session we had about Africa and his hypothetical  billion dollars destined for Africa All of those not all half of those problems mentioned last night  government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor  its why independent media is in business And its why it was invented So from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify Now ours is just one story Im sure that in this room there are like  other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work Here is where the problem is and Ill explain to you as well as I can what the problem is And its called fundraising Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations doing very important work Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf does not hear and switch the lights off Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink fundraising You know instead of people running in this dark trying to find their own match who will be willing who has the same goals Instead of all of that we thought there is  something new needs to be invented And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press freedom bonds If there are investors willing to finance US government budget deficit why wouldnt we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit Weve decided to do it this fall we will issue them probably in denominations of  dollars I dont want to advertise them too much thats not the point But the point is if we ever survive to actually issue them find enough investors that this can be considered a success theres nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring And those can be environmental bonds And then two weeks later Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds And before you know it any social cause can be actually financed in this way Now we do daydreaming in  with  seconds left But lets take the idea further You do it you start it in the States because its you know concepts are very very close to American minds But you can actually bring it to Europe too You can bring it to Asia You can once you have all of those different points you can make it easy for investors Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click Once you have more than  of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix What do investors get On one side financial on the other side social So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency Morningstar type It says you know social impact over here is spectacular five stars Financial they give you one percent only one star Now take it to the last step Once you have all of that put together theres not one reason why you couldnt actually have a marketplace for all of that where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other Thank you

76,I work with a species called Bonobo And Im happy most of the time because I think this is the happiest species on the planet Its kind of a wellkept secret This species lives only in the Congo And theyre not in too many zoos because of their sexual behavior Their sexual behavior is too humanlike for most of us to be comfortable with But  actually we have a lot to learn from them because theyre a very egalitarian society and theyre a very empathetic society And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside It permeates their entire life And its used for communication And its used for conflict resolution And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of divided our lives up into lots of parts We divided our world up with lots of categories And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit But I dont think that we were that way initially There are many people who think that the animal world is hardwired and that theres something very very special about man Maybe its his ability to have causal thought Maybe its something special in his brain that allows him to have language Maybe its something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics Well I dont know There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the s and they had no fire They had no stone tools To our knowledge they had no music So when you compare them to the Bonobo the Bonobo is a little hairier He doesnt stand quite as upright But there are a lot of similarities And I think that as we look at culture we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are And I dont really think its in our biology I think weve attributed it to our biology but I dont really think its there So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo This is Kanzi Hes a Bonobo Right now hes in a forest in Georgia His mother originally came from a forest in Africa And she came to us when she was just at puberty about six or seven years of age Now this shows a Bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left Clearly the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking The Bonobo although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright just as we are This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy As you can see theres not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked As they turn toward us youll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesnt have to rotate quite so much from side to side So the  the bipedal gait is a little easier And now we see all four Video Narrator The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa in the jungle encircled by the Congo River Canopied trees as tall as  meters  feet grow densely in the area It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo almost three decades ago Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee Slimbodied Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally Whats more they are able to walk upright for long distances Susan SavageRumbaugh video Lets go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame SS This is Kanzi and I in the forest None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained None of them are tricks They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously by NHK of Japan We have eight Bonobos Video Look at all this stuff thats here for our campfire SS An entire family at our research centre Video You going to help get some sticks Good We need more sticks too I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one Thats a wasps nest You can get it out I hope I have a lighter You can use the lighter to start the fire SS So Kanzi is very interested in fire He doesnt do it yet without a lighter but I think if he saw someone do it he might be able to do  make a fire without a lighter Hes learning about how to keep a fire going Hes learning the uses for a fire just by watching what we do with fire This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo These are happy vocalizations Video Youre happy Youre very happy about this part Youve got to put some water on the fire You see the water Good job SS Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack But he likes to carry things from place to place Video Austin I hear you saying Austin SS He talks to other Bonobos at the lab longdistance farther than we can hear This is his sister This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart Video Goodbye SS Shes got the pedals down but not the wheel She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel rather than turns it Like us she knows that that individual in the mirror is her Music Video Narrator By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human and documenting their development across two decades scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution His name is Nyota It means star in Swahili Music Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors In the wild the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring Here Panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to groom Nyota Very impressive Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself Realizing that Nyota might get hurt Panbanisha like any human mother carefully tugs to get the scissors back He can now cut through tough animal hide SS Kanzis learned to make stone tools Video Kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them twoandahalf million years ago  by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows he can make much larger sharper flakes Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough The tough hide is difficult to cut even with a knife The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making but difficult to handle requiring great skill Kanzis rock is from Gona Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors twoandahalf million years ago These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made The flat sharp edges are like knife blades Compare them to the tools our ancestors used they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzis Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods She keeps staring out the window SS This is  let me show you something we didnt think they would do Video For several days now Panbanisha has not been outside SS I normally talk about language Video Then Panbanisha does something unexpected SS But since Im advised not to do what I normally do I havent told you that these apes have language Its a geometric language Video She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor What is she writing SS Shes also saying the name of that with her voice Video Now she comes up to Dr Sue and starts writing again SS These are her symbols on her keyboard Music They speak when she touches them Video Panbanisha is communicating to Dr Sue where she wants to go A frame represents a hut in the woods Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor SS video Very nice Beautiful Panbanisha SS At first we didnt really realize what she was doing until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it Video This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods The curved line is very similar to the lexigram The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents collar It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out SS Thats an institutional requirement Video This symbol is not as clear as the others but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk Panbanisha watched Soon she began to write as well The Bonobos abilities have stunned scientists around the world How did they develop SS video We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them Its simply to use language around them because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you Once you have that capacity the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting  we want to create an environment in which they have fun and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them Narrator This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica until Nyota now one year old steals it Then he peers eagerly into his mothers mouth Is he looking for where the sound came from Dr Sue thinks its important to allow such curiosity to flourish This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano She wasnt forced to learn the piano she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest Researcher Go ahead Go ahead Im listening Do that real fast part that you did Yeah that part Narrator Kanzi plays the xylophone using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr Sues singing Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this funfilled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities Researcher OK now get the monsters Get them Take the cherries too Now watch out stay away from them now Now you can chase them again Time to chase them Now you have to stay away Get away Run away Run Now we can chase them again Go get them Oh no Good Kanzi Very good Thank you so much Narrator None of us Bonobo or human can possibly even imagine SS So we have a bispecies environment we call it a panhomoculture Were learning how to become like them Were learning how to communicate with them in really highpitched tones Were learning that they probably have a language in the wild And theyre learning to become like us Because we believe that its not biology its culture So were sharing tools and technology and language with another species Thank you

77,If youd like to learn how to play the lobster we have some here And thats not a joke we really do So come up afterwards and Ill show you how to play a lobster So actually I started working on whats called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp thats found off the coast of California And while thats an absolutely fascinating sound it actually turns out to be a very difficult project And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp or stomatopods make sound I started to think about their appendages And mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises which also have a fast feeding appendage And I started to think well maybe it will be interesting while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes And so today Ill talk about the extreme stomatopod strike work that Ive done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell So mantis shrimp come in two varieties there are spearers and smashers And this is a spearing mantis shrimp or stomatopod And he lives in the sand and he catches things that go by overhead So a quick strike like that And if we slow it down a bit this is the mantis shrimp  the same species  recorded at  frames a second played back at  frames per second And you can see its just a really spectacular extension of the limbs exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it Now the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod and these guys open up snails for a living And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack So Ill play it one more time He wiggles it in place tugs it with his nose and smash And a few smashes later the snail is broken open and hes got a good dinner So the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end or it can smash with the heel And today Ill talk about the smashing type of strike And so the first question that came to mind was well how fast does this limb move Because its moving pretty darn fast on that video And I immediately came upon a problem Every single highspeed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasnt fast enough to catch this movement We simply couldnt capture it on video And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology And so we struck up a deal I said Well if you guys rent the highspeed video system that could capture these movements you guys can film us collecting the data And believe it or not they went for it Laughter So we got this incredible video system Its very new technology  it just came out about a year ago  that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light And low light is a critical issue with filming animals because if its too high you fry them Laughter So this is a mantis shrimp There are the eyes up here and theres that raptorial appendage and theres the heel And that things going to swing around and smash the snail And the snails wired to a stick so hes a little bit easier to set up the shot And  yeah I hope there arent any snail rights activists around here So this was filmed at  frames per second and Im playing it back at  And so this is slowed down  times And as youll notice its still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down  times Its an incredibly powerful movement The whole limb extends out The body flexes backwards  just a spectacular movement And so what we did is we took a look at these videos and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question And we were in for our first surprise So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from  meters per second all the way up to  meters per second And for those of you who prefer miles per hour thats over  miles per hour in water And this is really darn fast In fact its so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system So our first surprise So that was really cool and very unexpected So you might be wondering well how do they do it And actually this work was done in the s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use whats called a catch mechanism or click mechanism And what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract and a latch that prevents anything from moving So the muscle contracts and nothing happens And once the muscles contracted completely everythings stored up  the latch flies upward and youve got the movement And thats basically whats called a power amplification system It takes a long time for the muscle to contract and a very short time for the limb to fly out And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History And if any of you ever have a chance backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the worlds best collections of preserved mantis shrimp And what  this is serious business for me So this  what I saw on every single mantis shrimp limb whether its a spearer or a smasher is a beautiful saddleshaped structure right on the top surface of the limb And you can see it right here It just looks like a saddle youd put on a horse Its a very beautiful structure And its surrounded by membranous areas And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while And then we did a series of calculations and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring There needs to be some kind of springloaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe and the speed that we observe and the output of the system So we thought OK this must be a spring  the saddle could very well be a spring And we went back to those highspeed videos again and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending And Ill just do that one more time And then if you take a look at the video  its a little bit hard to see  its outlined in yellow The saddle is outlined in yellow You can actually see it extending over the course of the strike and actually hyperextending So weve had very solid evidence showing that that saddleshaped structure actually compresses and extends and does in fact function as a spring The saddleshaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface or an anticlastic surface And this is very well known to engineers and architects because its a very strong surface in compression It has curves in two directions one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape So its very well known to engineers not as well known to biologists Its also known to quite a few people who make jewelry because it requires very little material to build this type of surface and its very strong So if youre going to build a thin gold structure its very nice to have it in a shape thats strong Now its also known to architects One of the most famous architects is Eduardo Catalano who popularized this structure And whats shown here is a saddleshaped roof that he built thats  and a half feet spanwise Its two and a half inches thick and supported at two points And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because its  he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure thats made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points And all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddleshaped spring in stomatopods In biological systems its important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it So very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds And interestingly this turns out  the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring Thats a bit long but it is sort of interesting So the next and final question was well how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if theyre able to break open snails And so I wired up whats called a load cell A load cell measures forces and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it And when this crystal is squeezed the electrical properties change and it  which  in proportion to the forces that go in So these animals are wonderfully aggressive and are really hungry all the time And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell and theyd smash away at it And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell And we were able to get some force measurements out And again we were in for a surprise I purchased a pound load cell thinking no animal could produce more than  pounds at this size of an animal And what do you know They immediately overloaded the load cell So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab and we were able to measure forces of well over  pounds generated by an animal about this big And actually just last week I got a pound load cell up and running and Ive clocked these animals generating well over  pounds of force And again I think this will be a world record I have to do a little bit more background reading but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given  per body mass So really incredible forces And again that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system But that was not the end of the story Now things  Im making this sound very easy this is actually a lot of work And I got all these force measurements and then I went and looked at the force output of the system And this is just very simple  time is on the Xaxis and the force is on the Yaxis And you can see two peaks And that was what really got me puzzled The first peak obviously is the limb hitting the load cell But theres a really large second peak half a millisecond later and I didnt know what that was So now youd expect a second peak for other reasons but not half a millisecond later Again going back to those highspeed videos theres a pretty good hint of what might be going on Heres that same orientation that we saw earlier Theres that raptorial appendage  theres the heel and its going to swing around and hit the load cell And what Id like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this on the surface of the load cell as the limb comes flying through And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light Audience Wow Sheila Patek And so if we just take that one frame what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble And what that is is cavitation And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds And when this happens it can cause areas of very low pressure which results in the water literally vaporizing And when that vapor bubble collapses it emits sound light and heat and its a very destructive process And so here it is in the stomatopod And again this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon because it destroys boat propellers People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesnt cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it just like these pictures show So this is a potent force in fluid systems and just to sort of take it one step further Im going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail This is taken at  frames per second and I have to give full credit to the BBC cameraman Tim Green for setting this shot up because I could never have done this in a million years  one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen You can see it coming in and an incredible flash of light and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail So really just an amazing image slowed down extremely to extremely slow speeds And again we can see it in slightly different form there with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces In fact you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks what I think was going on is that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring but the extremes of the fluid dynamics And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail So really fascinating double whammy so to speak from these animals So one question I often get after this talk  so I figured Id answer it now  is well what happens to the animal Because obviously if its breaking snails the poor limb must be disintegrating And indeed it does Thats the smashing part of the heel on both these images and it gets worn away In fact Ive seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt And every three months or so these animals molt and they build a new limb and its no problem Very very convenient solution to that particular problem So Id like to end on sort of a wacky note Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you I dont know So the saddles  that saddleshaped spring  has actually been well known to biologists for a long time not as a spring but as a visual signal And theres actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods And this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on whats really in all species their spring And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon So these animals go into a molting period where theyre unable to strike  their bodies become very soft And theyre literally unable to strike or they will selfdestruct This is for real And what they do is up until that time period when they cant strike they become really obnoxious and awful and they strike everything in sight it doesnt matter who or what And the second they get into that time point when they cant strike any more they just signal They wave their legs around And its one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing Its a wellestablished fact of these animals that they actually bluff They cant actually strike but they pretend to And so Im very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike or their strike force and something about the time period in the molting cycle So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring So to conclude I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell who worked closely with me on this And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time and for that Im very grateful Thank you very much ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

78,Were going to talk  my  a new lecture just for TED  and Im going show you some illusions that weve created for TED and Im going to try to relate this to happiness What I was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness  or happiness which I equate with joy in my particular area and I think theres something very fundamental And I was thinking about this And its in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that theres something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way You go see a movie And it has an unexpected twist  something that you didnt expect  and you find a joyful experience You look at those sort of illusions in my book and its not as what youd expect And theres something joyful about it And its the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things So what Im going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way I mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but Im going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way so I can make the audience here happy So Im going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations First of all I want to show you the particular illusion here I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other These are all perceptual tricks These are real objects that Im going to show you Now Im going to show you how it is done Ive looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience I want you to see how this illusion is constructed and its going to rotate so you see that its inside out Now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception snaps OK now Watch it as it rotates back again And this is a very bright audience all right See if you can stop it from happening even though you know  percent its true that  bam You cant undo it What does that tell you about yourselves Were going to do it again No doubt about it See if you can stop it from happening No Its difficult And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation about shape about color and so forth and its very primal And its an interesting question to ponder why these things  we find these things joyful Why would we find them joyful So heres something that Lionel did a while ago I like these sort of little things like this Again this is not an optical trick This is what you would see In other words its not a camera cut Its a perceptual trick OK We can violate your expectations about shape We can violate your expectations on representation  what an image represents What do you see here How many of you here see dolphins Raise your hand if you see dolphins OK those people who raised their hands afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right Actually this is the best example of priming by experience that I know If you are a child under the age of  who havent been ruined yet you will look at this image and see dolphins Now some of you adults here are saying What dolphins What dolphins But in fact if you reversed the figure ground  in other words the dark areas here  I forgot to ask for a pointer  but if you reverse it youll see a whole series of little dolphins By the way if youre also a student at CalTech  they also tend to just see the dolphins Its based on experience Now something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design too This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in Australia So if you look at this ad for beer all those people are in sort of provocative positions But they got it passed and actually won the Clio awards so its funny how you can do these things Remember that sort of um This is the joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around You know count the dots for Gore count the dots for Bush count em again  You can violate your expectations about experience Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine but you can stop the water in drops and  actually make all the drops levitate This is something were building for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff Now lets take a static image Can you see this Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up Its completely static Its a static image How many people see this illusion Its completely static Right Now when  its interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth texture And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth But the whole thing is actually flat Its painted Its trompe loeil And it was such a good trompe loeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldnt respond Now you can make design mistakes Like this building in New York So that when you see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions Or you take this particular unretouched photograph Now interestingly enough I get a lot of emails from people who say Is there any perceptual difference between males and females And I really say No I mean women can navigate through the world just as well as males can  and why wouldnt they However this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues They can match the hat Okay now getting to a part  I want to show design in illusions I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye So that when you saw from one little angle was like this And this little technique got popular in the th century and the th century to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to  sort of high point with Hans Holbeins Ambassadors And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull All right now Im going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise One of my favorites is Scott Kim I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy We have one here on TED and happiness OK now Arthur Ganson hasnt talked yet but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside And so we  Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson Well theres analog and digital Thought that was appropriate here And figure goes to ground And for the musicians And of course since happiness  we want joy to the world Now another great designer  hes very well known in Japan  Shigeo Fukuda And he just builds some fantastic things This is simply amazing This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano Pianist transforms to violinist This is really wild This assemblage of forks knives and spoons and various cutlery welded together It gives a shadow of a motorcycle You learn something in the sort of thing that I do which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells  unretouched seashells but just by rearranging them He did Einstein out of dice because after all Einstein said God does not play dice with the universe Bert Herzog out of unretouched keyboards Will Shortz crossword puzzle John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe loeil cabinets Now Im going to skip ahead since Im sort of running behind I want to show you quickly what Ive created some new type of illusions Ive done something with taking the Pixartype illusions So you see these kids the same size here running down the hall The two table tops of the same size Theyre looking out two directions at once You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller And thats something for you to think about all right So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here Does everyone see that Which is impossible You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape They are So if you measured them they would be And as I say those two figures are identical in size and shape And its interesting by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion how much stronger the illusions are Any case I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness and if youre interested in seeing more cool effects see me outside Id be happy to show you lots of things

79,Ill just take you to Bangladesh for a minute Before I tell that story we should ask ourselves the question Why does poverty exist I mean there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs We all live in the same planet but theres still a great deal of poverty in the world And I think  so I want to throw a perspective that I have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see whether its contributing or  contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last  years And by and large this has failed And you can see this book written by someone who worked in the World Bank for  years and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive By and large it did not work So the question is why is that In my mind there is something to learn from the history of Europe I mean even here yesterday I was walking across the street and they showed three bishops were executed  years ago right across the street from here So my point is theres a lot of struggle has gone in Europe where citizens were empowered by technologies And they demanded authorities from  to come down from their high horses And in the end theres better bargaining between the authorities and citizens and democracies capitalism  everything else flourished And so you can see the real process of  and this is backed up by this page book  that the authorities came down and citizens got up But if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last  years Aid actually did the opposite It empowered authorities and as a result marginalized citizens The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business Because they were getting it from abroad And in fact if you see oilrich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes  Nigeria Saudi Arabia all sorts of countries Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way It empowers authorities without activating the citizens  their hands legs brains what have you And if you agree with that then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people by the people for the people And that is the real network effect If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard so then things would improve And to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the World Bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments Just see the contrast And that is the perspective I have and then I can start my story Of course how would you empower citizens There could be all sorts of technologies And one is cell phones Recently The Economist recognized this but I stumbled upon the idea  years ago and thats what Ive been working on So  years ago I was trying to be an investment banker in New York We had  quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network And we got more productive because we didnt have to exchange floppy disks we could update each other more often But one time it broke down And it reminded me of a day in  There was a war going on in my country And my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural area where it was safer And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling And I walked  miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man And he wasnt there so I walked all afternoon back So I had another unproductive day So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York I put those two experiences together side by side and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity  whether its in a modern office or an underdeveloped village So naturally I  the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty And if thats the case then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time And it turns out that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every  people And all those phones were in the few urban places The vast rural areas where  million people lived there were no telephones So just imagine how many manmonths or manyears are wasted just like I wasted a day If you just multiply by  million people lets say losing one day a month whatever and you see a vast amount of resource wasted And after all poor countries like rich countries one thing weve got equal is their days are the same length  hours So if you lose that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries thats a huge waste So I started looking for any evidence that  does connectivity really increase productivity And I couldnt find much really but I found this graph produced by the ITU which is the International Telecommunication Union based in Geneva They show an interesting thing That you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country So the United States or the UK would be here outside And so the impact of one new telephone which is on the vertical axis is very little But if you come back to a poorer country where the GNP per capita is lets say  dollars or  dollars then the impact is huge  dollars Or  dollars The question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh It turns out  dollars So if you spend  dollars and lets say the telephone lasts  years and if  dollars every year  so thats  dollars So obviously this was a gadget to have And of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because theres a digital revolution going on then it would be even more dramatic And I knew a little economics by then  it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity But how would you specialize Lets say Im a fisherman and a farmer And Chris is a fisherman farmer Both are generalists So the point is that we could only  the only way we could depend on each other is if we can connect with each other And if we are neighbors I could just walk over to his house But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area But in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines But in any event its connectivity that leads to dependability And that leads to specialization That leads to productivity So the question was I started looking at this issue and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York There were a lot of reasons people told me why we dont have enough telephones And one of them is the lacking buying power Poor people apparently dont have the power to buy But the point is if its a production tool why do we have to worry about that I mean in America people buy cars and they put very little money down They get a car and they go to work The work pays them a salary the salary allows them to pay for the car over time The car pays for itself So if the telephone is a production tool then we dont quite have to worry about the purchasing power And of course even if thats true then what about initial buying power So then the question is why cant we have some kind of shared access In the United States we have  everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank So its  a bank tends to serve a whole community So we could do that for telephones And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet food clothing shelter whatever But again its very paternalistic You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures See you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing For instance the Internet was booming in the US because there were  there were people who had computers They had modems They had telephone lines so its very easy to bring in a new idea like the Internet But thats whats lacking in a poor country So for example we didnt have ways to have credit checks few banks to collect bills etc But thats why I noticed Grameen Bank which is a bank for poor people and had  branches  employees  million borrowers And they had these branches I thought I could put cell towers and create a network And anyway to cut the time short  so I started  I first went to them and said You know perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient But you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized I mean of course there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons  they had to be And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be  and rock the boat So I started focusing What is it that they really do So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank She typically buys a cow The cow gives milk And she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan And this is a business for her but its milk for everybody else And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow Because some way she could borrow  dollars from the bank get a phone and have the phone for everybody And its a business for her So I wrote to the bank and they thought for a while and they said Its a little crazy but logical If you think it can be done come and make it happen So I quit my job I went back to Bangladesh I created a company in America called Gonofone which in Bengali means peoples phone And angel investors in America put in money into that I flew around the world After about a million  I mean I got rejected from lots of places because I was not only trying to go to a poor country I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country After about a million miles and a meaningful  a substantial loss of hair I eventually put together a consortium and  which involved the Norwegian telephone company which provided the knowhow and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service To make the story short here is the coverage of the country You can see its pretty much covered Even in Bangladesh there are some empty places But we are also investing around another  million dollars this year to extend that coverage Now about that cow model I talked about There are about  people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods And its serving  villages which represent about  million people And these phones are generating about  million dollars for the company And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day which is like  dollars per year And of course its very beneficial in a lot of ways It increases income improves welfare etc And the result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with  million subscribers  of these phones I talked about  that produces about a third of the traffic in the network And  the net profit after taxes  very serious taxes  was  million dollars And the company contributed about  million dollars to the government coffers And again here are some of the lessons The government needs to provide economically viable services Actually this is an instance where private companies can provide that Governments need to subsidize private companies This is what some people think And actually private companies help governments with taxes Poor people are recipients Poor people are a resource Services cost too much for the poor Their involvement reduces the cost The poor are uneducated and cannot do much They are very eager learners and very capable survivors Ive been very surprised Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day Poor countries need aid Businesses  this one company has raised the  if the ideal figures are even five percent true this one company is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives And as I was trying to show you as far as Im concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen the famous inventor in America He has produced some power generators which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas which is running these generators And each of these generators is selling electricity to  houses each Its just an experiment We dont know how far it will go but its going on Thank you ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

80,Im supposed to scare you because its about fear right And you should be really afraid but not for the reasons why you think you should be You should be really afraid that  if we stick up the first slide on this thing  there we go  that youre missing out Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market youre going to miss one of the greatest adventures that weve ever been on And this is what this adventures really about This is crystallized DNA Every life form on this planet  every insect every bacteria every plant every animal every human every politician  Laughter is coded in that stuff And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA it looks like that And were just beginning to understand this stuff And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on Its the single greatest mapping project weve ever been on If you think that the mapping of Americas made a difference or landing on the moon or this other stuff its the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference And its beginning to tell us a lot about evolution It turns out that what this stuff is  and Richard Dawkins has written about this  is this is really a river out of Eden So the  billion base pairs inside each of your cells is really a history of where youve been for the past billion years And we could start dating things and we could start changing medicine and archeology It turns out that if you take the human species about  years ago white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way White Europeans were subject to the plague And when they were subject to the plague most people didnt survive but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR receptor And that mutation was passed on to their kids because theyre the ones that survived so there was a great deal of population pressure In Africa because you didnt have these cities you didnt have that CCR population pressure mutation We can date it to  years ago That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is and not as fast across Europe And were beginning to find these little things for malaria for sickle cell for cancers And in the measure that we map ourselves this is the single greatest adventure that well ever be on And this Friday I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine and I want you to toast these two people Because this Friday  years ago Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA and that is almost as important a date as the th of February when we first mapped ourselves but anyway well get to that I thought wed talk about the new zoo So all you guys have heard about DNA all the stuff that DNA does but some of the stuff were discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet If you think youre successful or cockroaches are successful it turns out that theres ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there And we didnt know that Pleurococcus was out there which is part of the reason why this whole speciesmapping project is so important Because were just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are And were finding amoebas like this This is the amoeba dubia And the amoeba dubia doesnt look like much except that each of you has about  billion letters which is what makes you you as far as gene code inside each of your cells and this little amoeba which you know sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions turns out to have  billion base pairs of gene code inside So this little thingamajig has a genome thats  times the size of yours And if youre thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms it may not turn out to be chips It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba And again were learning from life and how life works This funky little thing people didnt used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and of course nothing lived there And then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores And sitting next to that water in the cores was this little Deinococcus radiodurans doing a backstroke having its chromosomes blown apart every day six seven times restitching them living in about  times the radiation that would kill you And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is and how many different life forms there are and how there can be different life forms living in very different places maybe even outside of this planet Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this that brings up a whole series of interesting questions This little thingamajig we didnt know this thingamajig existed We should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye So this thing is  millimeters It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia And what youre looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria weve ever seen So its about the size of a little period on a sentence Again we didnt know this thing was there three years ago Were just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo This is a really odd one This is Ferroplasma The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron lives inside the equivalent of battery acid and excretes sulfuric acid So when you think of odd life forms when you think of what it takes to live it turns out this is a very efficient life form and they call it an archaea Archaea means the ancient ones And the reason why theyre ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core So its not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey Your fear should be that you are not that youre paying attention to stuff which is temporal I mean George Bush  hes going to be gone alright Life isnt Whether the humans survive or dont survive these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets And its just beginning to understand this code of DNA thats really the most exciting intellectual adventure that weve ever been on And you can do strange things with this stuff This is a baby gaur Conservation group gets together tries to figure out how to breed an animal thats almost extinct They cant do it naturally so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon take some cells out of an adult gaurs mouth code take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cows egg reprogram cows egg  different gene code When you do that the cow gives birth to a gaur We are now experimenting with bongos pandas elands Sumatran tigers and the Australians  bless their hearts  are playing with these things Now the last of these things died in September  These are Tasmanian tigers The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA And when we learn how to close the gene gaps then we can put a full string of DNA together And if we do that and insert this into a fertilized wolfs egg we may give birth to an animal that hasnt walked the earth since  And then you can start going back further and you can start thinking about dodos and you can think about other species And in other places like Maryland theyre trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where weve been for the past billion years because weve evolved from that stuff you can take that tree of life and collapse it back and in the measure that you learn to reprogram maybe well give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze And its all coming out of things that look like this These are companies that didnt exist five years ago Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields Some are public Some are private It takes about  billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time Takes about  million dollars the second time We will have a dollar genome within the next five to eight years That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code And it will be really boring It will read like this The really neat thing about this stuff is thats life And Lauries going to talk about this one a little bit Because if you happen to find this one inside your body youre in big trouble because thats the source code for Ebola Thats one of the deadliest diseases known to humans But plants work the same way and insects work the same way and this apple works the same way This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk Because this thing codes ones and zeros and this thing codes A T C Gs and it sits up there absorbing energy on a tree and one fine day it has enough energy to say execute and it goes thump Right And when it does that pushes a EXE what it does is it executes the first line of code which reads just like that AATCAGGGACCC and that means make a root Next line of code make a stem Next line of code TACGGGG make a flower thats white that blooms in the spring that smells like this In the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it  and by the way the first plant was read two years ago the first human was read two years ago the first insect was read two years ago The first thing that we ever read was in  a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae In the measure that you have the source code as all of you know you can change the source code and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn This changes all rules This is life but were reprogramming it This is what you look like This is one of your chromosomes And what you can do now is you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here and what those genes code for and what animals they code against and then you can tie it to the literature And in the measure that you can do that you can go home today and get on the Internet and access the worlds biggest public library which is a library of life And you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple if you go to Cliff Tabins lab at the Harvard Medical School hes reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings Why would Cliff be doing that He doesnt have a restaurant The reason why hes reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child and you picked up the lizard sometimes the tail fell off but it regrew Not so in human beings you cut off an arm you cut off a leg  it doesnt regrow But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code each cell can be reprogrammed if we dont stop stem cell research and if we dont stop genomic research to express different body functions And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings and what the program is for those cells to differentiate one of the things were going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells which you know as cancer and one of the things were going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone stomach skin pancreas And you are likely to be wandering around  and your children  on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time in some places in the world where they dont stop the research Hows this stuff work If each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand but only three percent codes which means its only one in a thousand times three percent very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference Take a simple declarative sentence Right Thats perfectly clear So men read that sentence and they look at that sentence and they read this Okay Now women look at that sentence and they say uhuh wrong This is the way it should be seen Thats what your genes are doing Thats why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand Right But you know hes reasonably good looking but I wont go there You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation You can look at this right And they look at the world a little differently They look at the same world and they say Thats how the same gene code  thats why you have  genes mice have  genes husbands have  genes Mice and men are the same Wives know that but anyway You can make very small changes in gene code and get really different outcomes even with the same string of letters Thats what your genes are doing every day Thats why sometimes a persons genes dont have to change a lot to get cancer These little chippies these things are the size of a credit card They will test any one of you for  genetic conditions That brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff but it also allows us to start going after diseases because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases Because in ALL leukemia that set of genes over there overexpresses In MLL its the middle set of genes and in AML its the bottom set of genes And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body then you take Gleevec and youre cured If it is not expressing in your body if you dont have one of those types  a particular one of those types  dont take Gleevec It wont do anything for you Same thing with Receptin if youve got breast cancer Dont have an HER receptor Dont take Receptin Changes the nature of medicine Changes the predictions of medicine Changes the way medicine works The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing and it turns out that this is not so important any more The US Library of Congress in terms of its printed volume of data contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis Let me say that again A single genomics company generates more data in a month on a compound basis than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress This is whats been powering the US economy Its Moores Law So all of you know that the price of computers halves every  months and the power doubles right Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene datas being deposited in GenBank Moores Law is right here its the blue line This is on a log scale and thats what superexponential growth means This is going to push computers to have to grow faster than theyve been growing because so far there havent been applications that have been required that need to go faster than Moores Law This stuff does And heres an interesting map This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School One of the really interesting questions is if all this datas free whos using it This is the greatest public library in the world Well it turns out that theres about  trillion bits moving inside from the United States to the United States about  trillion is going over to those European countries about s going to Japan theres almost no communication between Japan and nobody else is literate in this stuff Its free No ones reading it Theyre focusing on the war theyre focusing on Bush theyre not interested in life So this is what a new map of the world looks like That is the genomically literate world And that is a problem In fact its not a genomically literate world You can break this out by states And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life and you can watch New York fall off a cliff and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence And you can break it out by counties because its specific counties And if you want to get more specific its actually specific zip codes So you want to know where life is happening Well in Southern California its happening in  And thats it And thats the triangle between Salk Scripps UCSD and its called Torrey Pines Road That means you dont need to be a big nation to be successful it means you dont need a lot of people to be successful and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully picked s Same thing in Massachusetts Looks more spread out but  oh by the way the ones that are the same color are contiguous Whats the net effect of this In an agricultural society the difference between the richest and the poorest the most productive and the least productive was five to one Why Because in agriculture if you had  kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder you could produce about five times more wealth on average than your neighbor In a knowledge society that number is now  to  It really matters if youre literate not just in reading and writing in English and French and German but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple And very soon its going to matter if youre literate in life code So if there is something you should fear its that youre not keeping your eye on the ball Because it really matters who speaks life Thats why nations rise and fall And it turns out that if you went back to the s the most productive nation on earth was Australia per person And New Zealand was way up there And then the US came in about  and then Switzerland about  and then the US got back on top  beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks And today of course you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America Tiny landlocked state No oil No diamonds No natural resources Just smart people moving bits Different rules Heres differential productivity rates Heres how many people it takes to produce a single US patent So about  Americans  Koreans  Brits  Argentines You want to know why Argentinas crashing Its got nothing to do with inflation Its got nothing to do with privatization You can take a Harvardeducated Ivy League economist stick him in charge of Argentina He still crashes the country because he doesnt understand how the rules have changed Oh yeah and it takes about  million Indians Well watch what happens to India India and China used to be  percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution and they are now about  percent Two billion people One third of the global population producing  percent of the wealth because they didnt get this change because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project They didnt keep the people who were educated They didnt foment the businesses They didnt do the IPOs Silicon Valley did And thats why they say that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs Not integrated circuits Indians and Chinese Heres whats happening in the world It turns out that if youd gone to the UN in  when it was founded there were  countries in this world It turns out theres now about  Country after country is splitting seceding succeeding failing  and its all getting very fragmented And this has not stopped In the s these are sovereign states that did not exist before  And this doesnt include fusions or name changes or changes in flags Were generating about  states per year People are taking control of their own states sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse And the really interesting thing is you and your kids are empowered to build great empires and you dont need a lot to do it Music And given that the music is over I was going to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth and how code works Moderator Two minutes Juan Enriquez No Im going to stop there and well do it next year because I dont want to take any of Lauries time But thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

82,I got a visit almost exactly a year ago a little over a year ago from a very senior person at the Department of Defense Came to see me and said  of the kids that weve sent out have come back missing at least one full arm Whole arm Shoulder disarticulation And were doing the same thing we did for  more or less that weve done since the Civil War a stick and a hook And they deserve more than that And literally this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids thatll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table theyll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one and theyll be able to know the difference without looking at it You know had efferent afferent and haptic response He finishes explaining that and Im waiting for the big  pound paper proposal and he said Thats what I want from you I said Look youre nuts That technologys just not available right now And it cant be done Not in an envelope of a human arm with  degrees of freedom from your shoulder to your fingertips He said About two dozen of these  kids have come back bilateral You think its bad to lose one arm Thats an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone I got a day job and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like lets supply water to the world and power to the world and educate all the kids which Chris I will not talk about I dont need another mission I keep thinking about these kids with no arms He says to me Weve done some work around the country Weve got some pretty amazing neurology and other people I said Ill take a field trip Ill go see what you got Over the next month I visited lots of places some out here around the country found the best of the best I went down to Washington I saw these guys and said I did what you asked me I looked at whats out there I still think youre nuts But not as nuts as I thought I put a team together a little over  months ago got up to  someodd people We said were going to build a device that does what he wants We have  out of the  degrees of freedom you dont need the ones in the last two fingers We put this thing together A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed which is unfortunately more in the news these days We showed it to a bunch of guys One guy who described himself as being lucky because he lost his left arm and hes a righty He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys Said he was lucky because he had his good arm and then he pushed himself back from the table He had no legs These kids have attitudes that you just cant believe So Im going to show you now without the skin on it a second piece and then Im done But understand what youre looking at we made small enough to fit on a th percentile female so that we could put it in any of these people Its going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm to make silicon rubber then coat it and paint it in D  exact mirror image of their other limb So you wont see all the really cool stuff thats in this series elastic set of  actuators each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on so the more they put themselves under load the more it attaches They take the load off and it becomes again compliant Im going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in Washington Can we look at this thing Watch the fingers grab The thumb comes up Wrist This weighs  pounds Going to scratch his nose Its got  active degrees of freedom Now hes going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger Now hes going to put that down pick up a piece of paper rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist and read it ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

83,I have all my life wondered what mindboggling meant After two days here I declare myself boggled and enormously impressed and feel that you are one of the great hopes  not just for American achievement in science and technology but for the whole world Ive come however on a special mission on behalf of my constituency which are the tothethpower  thats a million trillion  insects and other small creatures and to make a plea for them If we were to wipe out insects alone just that group alone on this planet  which we are trying hard to do  the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land And within a few months Now how did I come to this particular position of advocacy As a little boy and through my teenage years I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life I had a butterfly period a snake period a bird period a fish period a cave period and finally and definitively an ant period By my college years I was a devoted myrmecologist a specialist on the biology of ants but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general  including all that it means to us as a species how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition crystallized in the wish that Im about to make to you My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama on the Florida peninsula As far back as I can remember I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there One day when I was only seven years old and fishing I pulled a pinfish theyre called with sharp dorsal spines up too hard and fast and I blinded myself in one eye I later discovered I was also hard of hearing possibly congenitally in the upper registers So in planning to be a professional naturalist  I never considered anything else in my entire life  I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldnt track frog calls either So I turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems the little things as I like to say who run the world In so doing I reached a frontier of biology so strange so rich that it seemed as though it exists on another planet In fact we live on a mostly unexplored planet The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science In the last  years thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology biologists have for example added a full onethird of the known frog and other amphibian species to bring the current total to  and more continue to pour in Two new kinds of whales have been discovered along with two new antelopes dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant  and even a distinct kind of gorilla At the extreme opposite end of the size scale the class of marine bacteria the Prochlorococci  that will be on the final exam  although discovered only in  are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth and moreover responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earths organisms  so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet Consider the fungi  including mushrooms rusts molds and many diseasecausing organisms  species are known to science but more than  million have been estimated to exist Consider the nematode roundworm the most abundant of all animals Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms  if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms About  species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists there could be hundreds of thousands of them even millions still unknown This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria which within just the last several years still were known from only about  species of bacteria worldwide But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil just a little handful of soil in the  billion bacteria that would be there Its been estimated that a single ton of soil  fertile soil  contains approximately four million species of bacteria all unknown So the question is what are they all doing The fact is we dont know We are living on a planet with a lot of activities with reference to our living environment done by faith and guess alone Our lives depend upon these creatures To take an example close to home there are over  species of bacteria now known  friendly bacteria  living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion And Id like to show it Assisted in this by Billie Holiday Video And that may be just the beginning The viruses those quasiorganisms among which are the prophages the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology a world unto themselves What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved although theyre obviously of enormous importance to us But this much we can say the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds or is likely to exceed that in all of the rest of life combined Nowadays in addressing microbial biodiversity scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs  to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitats surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars What will we find as we map the living world as finally we get this underway seriously As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals birds frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose instead two great domains of microorganisms true bacteria and onecelled organisms the archaea which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota the group that we belong to Some serious biologists and I count myself among them have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms one might  just might  find aliens among them True aliens stocks that arrived from outer space Theyve had billions of years to do it but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other But each of these species even the tiniest Prochlorococci are masterpieces of evolution Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence  and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy My own epiphany as a conservationist came in  while a Harvard graduate student searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba ants that shine in the sunlight  metallic green or metallic blue according to species and one species I discovered metallic gold I found my magical ants but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on and were then  and still are  being cut back I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique marvelous animals and plants on that island  and this is true of practically every part of the world  which took millions of years to evolve are in the process of disappearing forever And so it is everywhere one looks The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earths ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym HIPPO the animal hippo H is for habitat destruction including climate change forced by greenhouse gases I is for the invasive species like the fire ants the zebra mussels broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country and at an exponential rate  thats the I The P the first one in HIPPO is for pollution The second is for continued population human population expansion And the final letter is O for overharvesting  driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing The HIPPO juggernaut we have created if unabated is destined  according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research  to reduce half of Earths still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century Humanforced climate change alone  again if unabated  could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value  all thrown away The loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth security and yes spirituality for all time to come because previous cataclysms of this kind  the last one that ended the age of dinosaurs  took normally five to  million years to repair Sadly our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered For example even in the United States the  species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology Only about  percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status Of the  percent evaluated  percent are classified as in peril that is in danger of extinction Thats in the United States We are in short flying blind into our environmental future We urgently need to change this We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it We need to settle down before we wreck the planet And we need that knowledge This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earths biodiversity And let us call it the Encyclopedia of Life What is the Encyclopedia of Life A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world Amateurs can do it also It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone on demand anywhere in the world Ive written about this idea before and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form science has advanced Technology has moved forward Today the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it are within reach Indeed in the past year a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream I wish you would help them Working together we can make this real The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness and sense of human need It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity And most of all it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started for me personally  years ago to search for life to understand it and finally above all to preserve it That is my wish Thank you ,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

84,As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible standing in front of an audience is a cross between an outofbody experience and a deer caught in the headlights so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper and I only hope Im not struck by lightning bolts before Im done Id like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer I was a student in the s a time of social upheaval and questioning and on a personal level an awakening sense of idealism The war in Vietnam was raging the Civil Rights Movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism They not only recorded history they helped change the course of history Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience change became not only possible but inevitable I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism specifically visual journalism can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies It can give credit to sound decisionmaking adding momentum to success In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction it becomes a kind of intervention assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact What happens at ground level far from the halls of power happens to ordinary citizens one by one And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice And as a reaction it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda much as they would like to Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly The press is certainly a business and in order to survive it must be a successful business but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility Societys problems cant be solved until theyre identified On a higher plane the press is a service industry and the service it provides is awareness Every story does not have to sell something Theres also a time to give That was a tradition I wanted to follow Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution  I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer But I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an antiwar photograph Id like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues Ive been involved in over the past  years In  I went to Northern Ireland  IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields but right where people live During the early s I spent a lot of time in Central America which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War In Guatemala the central government  controlled by a oligarchy of European decent  was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword An antiSandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua A destroyed tank belonging to Somozas national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child At the same time a civil war was taking place in El Salvador and again the civilian population was caught up in the conflict Ive been covering the PalestinianIsraeli conflict since  This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada in  when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army In  the uprising escalated into an armed conflict and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin Without the political will to find common ground the continual friction of tactic and countertactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance and perpetuates the cycle of violence In the s after the breakup of the Soviet Union Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines and civil war broke out between Bosnia Croatia and Serbia This is a scene of housetohouse fighting in Mostar neighbor against neighbor A bedroom the place where people share intimacy where life itself is conceived became a battlefield A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or Bosnian soldiers killed in action This was once a park The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now At the same time in South Africa after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger I had to use it channel its energy turn it into something that would clarify my vision instead of clouding it In Transkei I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood of the Xhosa tribe Teenage boys lived in isolation their bodies covered with white clay After several weeks they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline Elsewhere in Africa there was famine In Somalia the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out Farmers were driven off their land and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction  primitive but extremely effective Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated slowly and painfully The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments but they were eventually drawn into the conflict and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu they were withdrawn In southern Sudan another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide Again international NGOs united under the umbrella of the UN staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved Im a witness and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored I also want it to be powerful and eloquent and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people Im photographing This man was in an NGO feeding center being helped as much as he could be helped He literally had nothing He was a virtual skeleton yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move He had not given up and if he didnt give up how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope In  after three months of covering the South African election I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela and it was the most uplifting thing Ive ever seen It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer The next day I left for Rwanda and it was like taking the express elevator to hell This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time and he even turned his face toward the light as if he wanted me to see him better I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world This time maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia the international community remained silent and somewhere around  people were slaughtered by their own countrymen  sometimes their own neighbors  using farm implements as weapons Perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda when Serbia attacked Kosovo international action was taken much more decisively NATO forces went in and the Serbian army withdrew Ethnic Albanians had been murdered their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home The image reminded me of a cave painting and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways Between  and  I covered the first two wars in Chechnya from inside Grozny This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside I found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well After the fall of Ceausescu I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family thereby making womens bodies an instrument of state economic policy Children who couldnt be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages Children with birth defects were labeled incurables and confined for life to inhuman conditions As reports began to surface again international aid went in Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust and four out of five workers came down with cancer After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident When the story was published unsolicited donations poured in A trust fund was established and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of It was a story that wasnt trying to sell anything Journalism had provided a channel for peoples natural sense of generosity and the readers responded I met a band of homeless children whod come to Jakarta from the countryside and ended up living in a train station By the age of  or  theyd become beggars and drug addicts The rural poor had become the urban poor and in the process theyd become invisible These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett isolated waiting in the dark but drawn to the light Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army The active ingredient was dioxin an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation In  I began documenting global health issues concentrating first on AIDS in Africa I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents and a lot of children had been born with HIV A hospital in Zambia I began documenting the close connection between HIVAIDS and tuberculosis This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs by shedding light on the critical social problems theyre trying to deal with I went to Congo with MSF and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program In the fall of  I went to Darfur This time I was on assignment for a magazine but again worked closely with MSF The international community still hasnt found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people Ive been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America This is a scene from New Orleans A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun This experience raised a lot of questions among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama I didnt see either of the planes hit and when I glanced out my window I saw the first tower burning and I thought it might have been an accident A few minutes later when I looked again and saw the second tower burning I knew we were at war In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero I had a realization Id been photographing in the Islamic world since   not only in the Middle East but also in Africa Asia and Europe At the time I was photographing in these different places I thought I was covering separate stories but on  history crystallized and I understood Id actually been covering a single story for more than  years and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation The central commercial district of Kabul Afghanistan at the end of the civil war shortly before the city fell to the Taliban Land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine Id witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world from political oppression civil war foreign invasions poverty famine I understood that in its suffering the Islamic world had been crying out Why werent we listening A Taliban fighter shot during a battle as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz When war with Iraq was imminent I realized the American troops would be very well covered so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family A day after American forces entered Baghdad a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds  a hopeful moment that was short lived For the first time in years Shiites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives It was obvious that the Shiites were a force to be reckoned with and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home This is a helicopter medic giving CPR to a soldier who had been shot in the head Military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history The signature weapon of the war is the IED and the signature wound is severe leg damage After enduring extreme pain and trauma the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable I tried to imagine myself in their place and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results One day in rehab someone started talking about surfing and all these guys whod never surfed before said Hey lets go And they went surfing Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people whats going on Sometimes they put their lives on the line because they believe your opinions and your influence matter They aim their pictures at your best instincts generosity a sense of right and wrong the ability and the willingness to identify with others the refusal to accept the unacceptable My TED wish theres a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news

85,"I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in 
perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent but insufficient in three major ways It is first of all profoundly unequal half the worlds people still living on less than two dollars a day a billion people with no access to clean water two and a half billion no access to sanitation a billion going to bed hungry every night one in four deaths every year from AIDS TB malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water   percent of them under five years of age Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing In the United States since  weve had five years of economic growth five years of productivity growth in the workplace but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us  which is why were all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living enjoying this evening  is profoundly unequal It is also unstable Unstable because of the threats of terror weapons of mass destruction the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we werent not so many years ago And perhaps most important of all it is unsustainable because of climate change resource depletion and species destruction When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have it is a world that moves away from unequal unstable unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities  locally nationally and globally  that share the characteristics of all successful communities a broadly shared accessible set of opportunities a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging All easier said than done When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago I think even though they didnt claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on  I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with went to school with worked with shared weekends with shared meals with In other words they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the st century Into this mix people like us who are not in public office have more power to do good than at any time in history because more than half the worlds people live under governments they voted in and can vote out And even nondemocratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion Because primarily of the power of the Internet people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree When the tsunami hit South Asia the United States contributed  billion dollars  percent of our households gave Half of them gave over the Internet The median contribution was somewhere around  dollars And thirdly because of the rise of nongovernmental organizations They businesses other citizens groups have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings When I became president in  there were none of these organizations in Russia There are now a couple of hundred thousand None in India There are now at least a half a million active None in China There are now  registered with the government probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons When I organized my foundation and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty fight disease combat climate change bridge the religious racial and other divides that torment the world but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort and the person who also is primarily active in the wish Ill make tonight Ira Magaziner is here with me and I want to thank him for everything hes done Hes over there When I got out of office and was asked to work first in the Caribbean to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis generic drugs were available for about  dollars a person a year If you bought them in vast bulks you could get them at a little under  dollars The first country we went to work in the Bahamas was paying  dollars for these drugs The market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold So the very first week we were working we got the price down to  dollars And all of a sudden they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines one of whom was cited in the film and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy because even at  dollars these drugs were being sold on a highmargin lowvolume uncertainpayment basis So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain and went to a lowmargin highvolume absolutely certainpayment business I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy But the price went to  dollars from  And pretty soon the average price was  dollars Now we can get it for about  dollars Childrens medicine was  dollars because nobody could afford to buy any of it We negotiated it down to  Then the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID got a bunch of other countries to help That childrens medicine is now  dollars a person a year The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose treat and care for people and deliver this medicine We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industryright deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools We just reorganized the markets And it occurred to me that in this whole nongovernmental world somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets And that is now what were trying to do and working with this large cities group to fight climate change to negotiate huge big volume deals that will enable cities which generate  percent of the worlds greenhouse gases to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics And this whole discussion as if its some sort of economic burden is a mystery to me I think its a birds nest on the ground When Al Gore won his welldeserved Oscar for the Inconvenient Truth movie I was thrilled but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly For those of you who saw An Inconvenient Truth the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one which shows heres where greenhouse gases are going if we dont do anything heres where they could go And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory We need a movie on those six categories And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it So were trying to do that So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do Now we have taken on a second thing and this gets to my wish It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be  the pessimistic headlines may say well we cant do this that or the other thing because of corruption  I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption and feeds corruption We now have the money given these low prices to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach Today these low prices are available in the  countries where we work and in a total of  countries and about  people are getting the benefits of them But the money is there to reach others The systems are not there to reach the people So what we have been trying to do working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places  but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight  is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS TB malaria other infectious diseases maternal and child health and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world And the test is one will it do the job Will it provide high quality care And two will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to  years Because the longer I deal with these problems the more convinced I am that we have to  whether its economics health education whatever  we have to build systems And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight You think about whatever your life has been however many obstacles you have faced in your life at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved In a world with no systems with chaos everything becomes a guerilla struggle and this predictability is not there And it becomes almost impossible to save lives educate kids develop economies whatever The person in my view who has done the best job of this in the health care area of building a system in a very poor area is Dr Paul Farmer who many of you know has worked for now  years with his group Partners in Health primarily in Haiti where he started but theyve also worked in Russia in Peru and other places around the world As poor as Haiti is in the area where Farmers clinic is active  and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve  since  they have not lost one person to tuberculosis not one And theyve achieved a lot of other amazing health results So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem we wanted to build a healthcare network because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in  and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day So I rang up asked Paul Farmer if he would help Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country number one it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last  years and number two we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world And so we have set about doing that Now we started working together  months ago And were working in an area called Southern Kayonza which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda with a group that originally includes about  people Were essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly who work on bringing about health education clean water and sanitation providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it The procedures that make this work have been perfected as I said by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last  years Recently we did an evaluation of the first  months of our efforts in Rwanda And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it Ill tell you a little bit about our team because its indicative of what we do We have about  people around the world working in our AIDS program some of them for nothing  just for transportation room and board And then we have others working in these other related programs Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble who is an unusually gifted woman but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her s She was CEO of a successful eventure  she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures  and at  she decided she wanted to do something different with her life So she now works fulltime on this for very little pay She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it When we came to this rural area  percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition  percent of them died before they reached the age of five Mortality at birth was over twoandahalf percent Over  percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation  all entirely preventable and treatable Over  percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses  again all preventable and treatable And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis Within the first  months the following things happened we went from zero to about  people being treated for AIDS Thats  percent of the people who need treatment in this area Listen to this less than fourtenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment Thats lower than the figure in the United States Less than threetenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive secondline drugs  pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system Thats about  percent of all the pregnancies About  percent of all the people  I said  I meant  About  percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it  in just  months up from zero when we started  percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow Weve started the first malaria treatment programs theyve ever had there Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics complete with solar power generators good lab technology We now are treating  people a month despite the fact that almost  percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home And the most important thing is because weve implemented Paul Farmers model using community health workers we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and  percent of GDP on health care except for the United States we spend   but thats a story for another day Were now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up Were also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho And we have similar projects in Tanzania Mozambique Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing to save as many lives as quickly as we can but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world We need initial upfront investment to train doctors nurses health administration and community health workers throughout the country to set up the information technology the solar energy the water and sanitation the transportation infrastructure But over a five to year period we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a highquality rural health system in a poor country Rwanda that can be a model for Africa and indeed for any poor country anywhere in the world My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorists with more productive citizens and fewer haters a place wed all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in It has been an honor for me particularly to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter the Scottish philanthropist where last year we using the same thing with AIDS drugs cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by  percent and achieved three to fourhundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers These people have been through a lot and none of us most of all me helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other Were undoing that now and they are so over it and so into their future Were doing this in an environmentally responsible way Im doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the  percent of the people that have no access but to do it with clean energy To have responsible reforestation projects the Rwandans interestingly enough have been quite good Mr Wilson in preserving their topsoil Theres a couple of guys from southern farming families  the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what theyd done with it We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation reorganize itself focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive quality health care with minimal outside help I am grateful for this prize and I will use it to that end We could use some more help to do this but think of what it would mean if we could have a worldclass health system in Rwanda  in a country with a lessthanonedollaradaypercapita income one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth Its worth a try and I believe it would succeed Thank you and God bless you ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

86,"On September  the morning
of my seventh birthday I came downstairs to the kitchen
where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading
the paper or something and I sort of presented myself to them
in the doorway and they said Hey happy birthday
And I said Im seven And my father smiled and said Well you know
what that means dont you And I said Yeah
that Im going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents And my dad said Well yes But more importantly being seven means that
youve reached the age of reason and youre now capable of committing
any and all sins against God and man Now I had heard this phrase
age of reason before Sister Mary Kevin
had been bandying it about my secondgrade class at school But when she said it the phrase seemed all caught up
in the excitement of preparations for our first communion
and our first confession and everybody knew that was really
all about the white dress and the white veil And anyway I hadnt really paid
all that much attention to that phrase age of reason So I said Yeah yeah age of reason
What does that mean again And my dad said Well we believe
in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids dont know
the difference between right and wrong but when youre seven
youre old enough to know better So youve grown up
and reached the age of reason and now God will start
keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record And I said Oh  Wait a minute You mean all that time up till today all that time I was so good
God didnt notice it And my mom said Well I noticed it And I thought How could
I not have known this before How could it not have sunk in
when theyd been telling me All that being good
and no real credit for it And worst of all
how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day
that it was basically useless to me So I said Well Mom and Dad
what about Santa Claus I mean Santa Claus knows
if youre naughty or nice right And my dad said Yeah but honey I think thats technically just
between Thanksgiving and Christmas And my mother said Oh Bob stop it
Lets just tell her I mean shes seven Julie there is no Santa Claus Now this was actually
not that upsetting to me My parents had this whole
elaborate story about Santa Claus how they had talked to Santa Claus
himself and agreed that instead of Santa
delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve like he did for every other family
who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning our family would give Santa more time Santa would come to our house
while we were at nine oclock high mass on Christmas morning but only
if all of us kids did not make a fuss Which made me very suspicious It was pretty obvious that it was really
our parents giving us the presents I mean my dad had a very
distinctive wrapping style and my mothers handwriting
was so close to Santas Plus why would Santa save time
by having to loop back to our house after hed gone
to everybody elses There was only one obvious conclusion
to reach from this mountain of evidence our family was too strange and weird
for even Santa Claus to come visit and my poor parents were trying
to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection
by Santa who was jolly  but lets face it
he was also very judgmental So to find out that there was
no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief I left the kitchen not really
in shock about Santa but rather I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed
this whole age of reason thing It was too late for me
but maybe I could help someone else someone who could use the information They had to fit two criteria they had to be old enough
to be able to understand the whole concept of the age
of reason and not yet seven The answer was clear
my brother Bill He was six Well I finally found Bill about a block away from our house
at this public school playground It was a Saturday
and he was all by himself just kicking a ball
against the side of a wall I ran up to him and said Bill I just realized that the age of reason
starts when you turn seven and then youre capable
of committing any and all sins against God and man And Bill said So And I said So youre six You have a whole year to do anything
you want to and God wont notice it And he said So And I said So So everything And I turned to run
I was so angry with him But when I got to the top of the steps I turned around dramatically and said Oh by the way Bill 
there is no Santa Claus Now I didnt know it at the time but I really wasnt turning seven
on September th For my th birthday I planned a slumber party
with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand
my mother took me aside and said I need to speak to you privately September th is not your birthday
Its October th And I said What And she said  Listen The cutoff date to start
kindergarten was September th So I told them that your birthday
was September th and then I wasnt sure that you werent just going to go
blab it all over the place so I started to tell you
your birthday was September th But Julie you were so ready to start
school honey You were so ready I thought about it and when I was four I was already the oldest of four children and my mother even had
another child to come so what I think she 
understandably  really meant was that she was so ready
she was so ready Then she said Dont worry Julie Every year on October th when it was your birthday
but you didnt realize it I made sure that you ate
a piece of cake that day Which was comforting but troubling My mother had been celebrating
my birthday with me without me What was so upsetting
about this new piece of information was not that I had to change
the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends What was most upsetting
was that this meant I was not a Virgo I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom And I read my horoscope every single day and it was so totally me And this meant that I was a Libra So I took the bus downtown
to get the new Libra poster The Virgo poster is a picture
of a beautiful woman with long hair sort of lounging by some water but the Libra poster is just a huge scale This was around the time
that I started filling out physically and I was filling out a lot more
than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea
that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing But I got the new Libra poster and I started to read
my new Libra horoscope and I was astonished to find
that it was also totally me It wasnt until years later looking back on this whole ageofreason
changeofbirthday thing that it dawned on me I wasnt turning seven
when I thought I turned seven I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to
before God started keeping tabs on me Oh life can be so cruel One day two Mormon
missionaries came to my door Now I just live off a main
thoroughfare in Los Angeles and my block is  well
its a natural beginning for people who are peddling
things door to door Sometimes I get little old ladies
from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon
pictures of heaven And sometimes I get
teenagers who promise me that they wont join a gang
and just start robbing people if I only buy some
magazine subscriptions from them So normally I just ignore the doorbell
but on this day I answered And there stood two boys each about 
in white starched shortsleeved shirts and they had little name tags that identified them
as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latterday Saints and they said they had
a message for me from God I said A message for me From God
And they said Yes Now I was raised
in the Pacific Northwest around a lot of Church of Latterday
Saints people and you know Ive worked with them and even dated them but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people
when they were out on a mission and I guess I was sort of curious
so I said Well please come in And they looked really happy because I dont think this happens
to them all that often And I sat them down
and I got them glasses of water  Ok I got it I got it I got them glasses of water Dont touch my hair thats the thing You cant put a video
of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair Ok So I sat them down
and I got them glasses of water and after niceties they said Do you believe that God loves you
with all his heart And I thought Well
of course I believe in God but you know I dont like
that word heart because it anthropomorphizes God and I dont like the word his
either because that sexualizes God But I didnt want to argue
semantics with these boys so after a very long
uncomfortable pause I said Yes yes I do I feel very loved And they looked at each other and smiled like that was the right answer And then they said Do you believe that were all brothers
and sisters on this planet And I said Yes I do And I was so relieved that it was
a question I could answer so quickly And they said Well then
we have a story to tell you And they told me this story
all about this guy named Lehi who lived in Jerusalem in  BC Now apparently in Jerusalem in  BC
everyone was completely bad and evil Every single one of them
man woman child infant fetus And God came to Lehi and said to him Put your family on a boat
and I will lead you out of here And God did lead them He led them to America I said America From Jerusalem to America
by boat in  BC And they said Yes Then they told me
how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced
and over the course of  years there were two great races of them
the Nephites and the Lamanites and the Nephites were totally good 
each and every one of them  and the Lamanites
were totally bad and evil  every single one of them
just bad to the bone Then after Jesus died
on the cross for our sins on his way up to heaven he stopped by America
and visited the Nephites And he told them that if they all remained
totally totally good  each and every one of them  they would win the war
against the evil Lamanites But apparently somebody blew it because the Lamanites
were able to kill all the Nephites All but one guy this guy named Mormon who managed to survive
by hiding in the woods And he made sure
this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics
chiseled onto gold plates which he then buried
near Palmyra New York Well I was just on the edge of my seat I said What happened to the Lamanites And they said Well they became
our Native Americans here in the US And I said So you believe
the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil And they said Yes Then they told me
how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates
right in his backyard and he also found this magic stone
back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him
to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English Well at this point I just wanted to give
these two boys some advice about their pitch I wanted to say  Ok dont start with this story I mean even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test
before they start  telling people all about Xenu
the evil intergalactic overlord Then they said Do you believe
that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets And I said No I dont because I was sort of upset
about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story but the truth was
I hadnt really thought this through so I backpedaled a little and I said Well what exactly
do you mean by righteous And what do you mean by prophets
Like could the prophets be women And they said No And I said Why And they said Well its because
God gave women a gift that is so spectacular it is so wonderful that the only gift
he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy What is this wonderful gift
God gave women I wondered Maybe their greater ability
to cooperate and adapt Womens longer lifespan The fact that women tend to be
much less violent than men But no  it wasnt any of these gifts They said Well its her ability
to bear children I said Oh come on I mean even if women
tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 
to the time they were  assuming they didnt die from exhaustion it still seems like some women
would have some time left over to hear the word of God And they said No Well then they didnt look so
freshfaced and cute to me any more but they had more to say They said Well we also believe
that if youre a Mormon and if youre in good standing
with the church when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity And I said Oh dear That wouldnt be
such a good incentive for me And they said Oh Hey Well we also believe
that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you
in its best original state Like if youd lost a leg
well you get it back Or if youd gone blind you could see I said Oh Now I dont have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago So does this mean
that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back And they said Sure And I said I dont want it back
Im happy without it Gosh What if you had a nose job
and you liked it Would God force you
to get your old nose back Then they gave me this Book of Mormon told me to read
this chapter and that chapter and said theyd come back
and check in on me and I think I said something
like Please dont hurry or maybe just Please dont
and they were gone Ok so I initially felt
really superior to these boys and smug in my more conventional faith But then the more I thought about it
the more I had to be honest with myself If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology
and dogma for the very first time and they said We believe that God
impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin
is maniacally important to us And she had a baby
and thats the son of God I mean I would think
thats equally ridiculous Im just so used to that story So I couldnt let myself feel
condescending towards these boys But the question they asked me
when they first arrived really stuck in my head Did I believe that God
loved me with all his heart Because I wasnt exactly sure
how I felt about that question Now if they had asked me Do you feel that God loves
you with all his heart Well that would have been much different
I think I would have instantly answered Yes yes I feel it all the time I feel Gods love
when Im hurt and confused and I feel consoled and cared for I take shelter in Gods love when
I dont understand why tragedy hits and I feel Gods love when I look
with gratitude at all the beauty I see But since they asked me that question
with the word believe in it somehow it was all different because I wasnt exactly sure
if I believed what I so clearly felt ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

87,"You know when Chris first approached me
to speak at TED I said no because I felt
like I wasnt going to be able to make that personal connection
you know that I wanted to Its such a large conference But he explained to me
that he was in a bind and that he was having trouble
finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that
the conference was known for So I said fine Ted  I mean Chris Ill come on two conditions One I want to speak as early
in the morning as possible And two I want to pick
the theme for TED  And luckily he agreed And the theme in two years
is going to be Cute Pictures Of Puppies Video Music How to Dance Properly BASIC TWIRL NEW SCHOOL OLD SCHOOL WHOS YOUR DADDY RIDE THE PONY MAKE LOVE TO THE CROWD SMACKING THAT ASS STIR THE POT OF LOVE HANGING OUT  CASUAL WORD I invented the Placebo Camera It doesnt actually take pictures
but its a hell of a lot cheaper and you still feel like you were there Clears his throat Dear Sir good day
compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family Breathes in I know this letter
will come to you surprisingly but let it not be a surprise to you for nature has a way
of arriving unannounced and as an adage says
originals are very hard to find but their echoes sound ouder So I decided to contact you myself for you to assure me
of safety and honesty if I have to entrust any amount of money
under your custody I am Mr Micheal Bangura
the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the Minister of Finance
in Sierra Leone but was killed during the civil war Knowing your country to be
economical conducive for investment and your people as transparent
and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise I write you Before my father death he had the sum of  million
United States dollars which he kept away from the rebel
leaders during the course of the war This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves
all over the country before the outbreak of war When the war broke out the rebel leader demanded
the fund be given to him my father insisted it
was not in his possession and he was killed because of his refusal
to release the fund Meanwhile my mother and I is the only person who knows about it
because my father always confide in me Sighs I made an arrangement
with a Red Cross relief worker who used his official van to transport
the money to Lungi Airport Freetown although he did not know
the real contents of the box The fund was deposited
as a family reasure in a safe reliable security company
in Dakar Senegal where I was only given temporary asylum I do not wish to invest
the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate
and so close to my country The only assistance I need from you
which I know you would do for me are the following
one be a silent partner and receive the funds
in your account in trust two provide a bank account
under your control to which the funds will be remitted three receive the funds
into your account in trust take out your commission
and leave the rest of the money until I arrive
after the transfer is complete Sincerely Mr Micheal Bangura This is really embarrassing I was told backstage
that I have  minutes I only prepared  So if its cool
Id like to just wait for three Laughter ends Im really sorry Whats your name Mark Surfas Its pretty cool huh Pursuing happiness Are you a virgin Virgin I mean  no I mean
like in the TED sense Are you Oh yeah So what are you like a thousand
two thousand somewhere in there Huh Oh You dont know what Im talking about Ah Mark  Surfas   am I good And thats nothing to be ashamed of Thats nothing to be ashamed of Yeah I was hanging out
with some Google guys last night Really cool we were getting wasted And they were telling me that Google
software has gotten so advanced that based on your interaction
with Google over your lifetime they can actually predict
what you are going to say  next And I was like Get the fuck
out of here Thats crazy But they said
No but dont show anyone But they slipped up And they said that I could just type in
What was I going to say next and my name and it would tell me And I have to tell you this is
an unadulterated piece of software this is a real Internet browser
and this is the actual Google site and were going to test it out live today What was I going to say next And Ze Frank  thats me Am I feeling lucky Shouting Am I feeling lucky Audience Yes Yeah Sighs Ze Frank Oh Amazing In March of   I filmed myself dancing
to Madonnas Justify My Love On a Thursday I sent out a link
to a website that featured those clips to  of my closest friends as part of an invitation to my 
an invitation to my th  th  th birthday party Clears throat By Monday over a million people
were coming to this site a day Sighs Within a week I received a call
from Earthlink that said due to a  cents
per megabyte overage charge I owed them  dollars Needless to say
I was able to leave my job WAS LAID OFF And finally you know become freelance UNEMPLOYED But some people refer to me more
as like an Internet guru or  JACKASS swami I knew I had something Id basically distilled
a very difficulttoexplain and complex philosophy
which I wont get into here because its a little too deep
for all of you but  Its about what makes websites popular
and you know its  DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT
AND DONT SELL ANYTHING Its unfortunate
that I dont have more time Maybe I can come back next year
or something like that Im obsessed with email
I get a lot of it Four years later I still get probably
two or three hundred emails a day from people I dont know and its been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know
different cultures you know Its like a microscope
to the rest of the world You can kind of peer
into other peoples lives And I also feel like I get a lot
of inspiration from the average user For example somebody wrote
Hey Ze if you ever come to Boulder you should rock out with us
and I said Why wait rocking out Video Music And they said
Hey Ze thanks for rocking out but I meant the kind of rocking out
where wed be naked And that was embarrassing But you know its kind of a collaboration
between me and the fans so I said Sure rocking out naked Video Music I hear a lot of you whispering And I know what youre saying Holy crap How is his presentation so smooth And I have to say
that its not all me this year I guess Chris has to take some credit
here because in years past I guess theres been
some sort of subpar speakers at TED I dont know And so this year Chris sent us
a TED conference simulator Which really allowed us as speakers
to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be
ready for this experience And Ive got to say that you know
its really really great to be here Prerecorded applause Id like to tell all of you a little joke Prerecorded applause and cheering Not just the good stuff though You can do heckler mode Voice Hey moron get off the stage ZF You get off the stage Voice We want Malcolm Gladwell Baby cooing Huge crowd applauding In case you run over time Heroic music Just one last thing
Id like to say Id really  Id like to thank all of you
for being here Loud music And frog mode Singing Sings Ah the first time that I made
love to a rock shrimp  Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes Sighs Its true Some people say to me Ze youre doing all this stuff
this Internet stuff and youre not making any money Why And I say Mom Dad  Im trying I dont know if youre all aware of this but the video game market kids are playing these video games but supposedly theres tons of money I mean like I think
 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things So I decided to try my hand I came up with a few games This is called Atheist I figured it would be popular
with the young kids OK Look Ill move around
and say some things Sighs Game over There is no replay So that didnt go over so well I dont really understand
why youre laughing Should have done this
before I tried to pitch it Buddhist of course looks
very very similar to Atheist But you come back as a duck And this is great because
you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time And Chris had said in an email that we should really bring
something new to TED something that we havent shown anyone So I made this for TED Its Christian Its the third in the series Im hoping its going
to do well this year Sighs Do you have a preference Good choice So you can wait for the Second Coming which is a random number
between one and  million So really what are we talking about here Oh tech joy Tech joy to me means something
because I get a lot of joy out of tech And in fact making things
using technology  and Im being serious here even though Im using
my sarcastic voice  I wont  hold on Making things you know  making things actually
does give me a lot of joy Its the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half
above perpetual anxiety in my life and its that feeling of being
about  percent complete on a project  where you know you still have
something to do but its not finished
and youre not starting something  that really fills my entire life And so what Ive done is I started getting interested
in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who dont consider
themselves artists Were in a culture of guruship Its so hard to use some software
because you know its unapproachable people feel like they have
to read the manual So I try to create
these very minimal activities that allow people to express
themselves and hopefully  The End by The Doors Whoa Im like  on the page
but it doesnt exist Its like  seriously though  I try to create meaningful environments
for people to express themselves Here I created a contest called
When Office Supplies Attack which I think really resonated
with the working population Over  entries in three weeks Toilet paper fashion Again people from all over the country The watch is particularly incredible Online drawing tools 
youve probably seen a lot of them I think theyre wonderful Its a chance for people
to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff But Im interested
in the process of creating as the real event that Im interested in And the problem is that
a lot of people suck at drawing and they get bummed out at this
sort of you know stick figure awful little thing that they created And eventually it just makes them
stop playing with it or they draw penises and things like that So the Scribbler is an attempt
to create a generative tool In other words its a helping tool You can draw your simple stick figure and it collaborates with you to create
sort of a postwar German etching In fact its tuned to be better
at drawing things that look worse So we go ahead and we start scribbling So the idea is that you can really you know partake in this process but watch something
really crappy look beautiful And here are some of my favorites This is the little trap marionette
that was submitted to me Very cool Darling Beautiful stuff I mean this is incredible An yearold girl drew this
and submitted it Its just gorgeous Im dead serious here This is not a joke But I think its a really fun
and wonderful thing So this is called the Fiction Project This is an online space which is basically
a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative
fiction writing These are haikus None of the haikus were written
by the same person In fact each line is contributed
by a different person at a different time I think that the now tied up tied down mistress cruel approaches me
now tied down its up Its an amazing way and Ill tell you if you come home and your spouse
or whoever it is says Lets talk  That like chills you to the very core But its peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together
doing fun things They actually get to know each other and its sort of like lowthreshold
peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital
that were lacking And very very quickly 
I love puppets Heres a puppet It dances to music Lotte Reiniger an amazing
shadow puppeteer in the s that started doing more elaborate things I became interested in puppets and I just want to show
one last thing to you Oh this is how you make puppets Chris Anderson Ladies

89,"This is me My name is Ben Saunders I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places On May th last year I stood alone at the North geographic Pole I was the only human being in an area oneandahalf times the size of America fiveandahalf thousand square miles More than  people have climbed Everest  people have stood on the moon Including me only four people have skied solo to the North Pole And I think the reason for that   thank you  I think the reason for that is that its  its  well its as Chris said bonkers Its a journey that is right at the limit of human capability I skied the equivalent of  marathons back to back  miles in  weeks And I was dragging all the food I needed the supplies the equipment sleeping bag one change of underwear  everything I needed for nearly three months What were going to try and do today in the  and a bit minutes Ive got left is to try and answer three questions The first one is why The second one is how do you go to the loo at minus  Ben Ive read somewhere that at minus  exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute so how do you answer the call of nature I dont want to answer these now Ill come on to them at the end Third one how do you top that Whats next It all started back in  My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow  enormously experienced chap This was like my polar apprenticeship We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here Severnaya Zemlya to the North Pole And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole geographic North Pole is that its slap bang in the middle of the sea This is about as good as maps get and to reach it youve got to ski literally over the frozen crust the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean Id spoken to all the experts Id read lots of books I studied maps and charts But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what Id let myself in for I was  years old No one my age had attempted anything like this and pretty quickly almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong We were attacked by a polar bear on day two I had frostbite in my left big toe We started running very low on food We were both pretty hungry losing lots of weight Some very unusual weather conditions very difficult ice conditions We had decidedly lowtech communications We couldnt afford a satellite phone so we had HF radio You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent Theres a wire dangling down either side That was our HF radio antenna We had less than two hours twoway communication with the outside world in two months Ultimately we ran out of time Wed skied  miles We were just over  miles left to go to the Pole and wed run out of time We were too late into the summer the ice was starting to melt we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio and they said Look boys youve run out of time Weve got to pick you up And I felt that I had failed wholeheartedly I was a failure The one goal the one dream Id had for as long as I could remember  I hadnt even come close And skiing along that first trip I had two imaginary video clips that Id replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough just to keep my motivation going The first one was reaching the Pole itself I could see vividly I suppose being filmed out of the door of a helicopter there was kind of rock music playing in the background and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack you know flying in the wind I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole you know  ah glorious moment  the music kind of reaching a crescendo The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport and I could see again vividly the camera flashbulbs going off the paparazzi the autograph hunters the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal And of course neither of these things happened We didnt get to the Pole and we didnt have any money to pay anyone to do the PR so no one had heard of this expedition And I got back to Heathrow My mum was there my brother was there my granddad was there  had a little Union Jack   and that was about it I went back to live with my mum I was physically exhausted mentally an absolute wreck considered myself a failure In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition and lying on my mums sofa day in day out watching daytime TV My brother sent me a text message an SMS  it was a quote from the Simpsons It said You tried your hardest and failed miserably The lesson is dont even try Fast forward three years I did eventually get off the sofa and start planning another expedition This time I wanted to go right across on my own this time from Russia at the top of the map to the North Pole where the sort of kink in the middle is and then on to Canada No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own Two Norwegians did it as a team in  No ones done it solo Very famous very accomplished Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner tried it in  and he was rescued after a week He described this expedition as  times as dangerous as Everest So for some reason this was what I wanted to have a crack at but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece let alone make it across to Canada I had to take a radical approach This meant everything from perfecting the sawnoff subtwogram toothbrush to working with one of the worlds leading nutritionists in developing a completely new revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch  calories a day And the expedition started in February last year Big support team We had a film crew a couple of logistics people with us my girlfriend a photographer At first it was pretty sensible We flew British Airways to Moscow The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir spelled KRAS The next bit wed chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga which was the sort of last bit of civilization Our cameraman who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times actually asked the pilot before we got on the plane how long this flight would take and the pilot  Russian pilot  completely deadpan replied Six hours  if we live We got to Khatanga I think the joke is that Khatanga isnt the end of the world but you can see it from there It was supposed to be an overnight stay We were stuck there for  days There was a kind of vodkafueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter so we were stuck We couldnt move Finally morning of day  we got the allclear loaded up the helicopters  two helicopters flying in tandem  dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice We had a frantic sort of  minutes of filming photography while the helicopter was still there I did an interview on the satellite phone and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter wham the door closed and I was alone And I dont know if words will ever quite do that moment justice All I could think about was running back up to the door banging on the door and saying Look guys I havent quite thought this through To make things worse you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen thats a full moon Because wed been held up in Russia of course the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides when youre standing on the frozen surface of the sea high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen  the ice is going to start moving around a bit I was you can see there pulling two sledges Grand total in all  days of food and fuel  kilos  thats almost exactly  pounds When the ice was flat or flattish I could just about pull both When the ice wasnt flat I didnt have a hope in hell I had to pull one leave it and go back and get the other one Literally scrambling through whats called pressure ice  the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean the wind and the tides NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began And its always drifting The pack ice is always drifting I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the  weeks I was alone last year and I was drifting backwards most of the time My record was minus  miles I got up in the morning took the tent down skied north for sevenandahalf hours put the tent up and I was two and a half miles further back than when Id started I literally couldnt keep up with the drift of the ice Video So its day  Im lying in the tent getting ready to go The weather is just appalling  oh drifted back about five miles in the last  last night Later in the expedition the problem was no longer the ice It was a lack of ice  open water I knew this was happening I knew the Artic was warming I knew there was more open water And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve This was my little bit of biomimicry Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines If they come to water theyll climb in swim across it So we had a dry suit developed  I worked with a team in Norway  based on a sort of survival suit  I suppose that helicopter pilots would wear  that I could climb into It would go on over my boots over my mittens it would pull up around my face 
and seal pretty tightly around my face And this meant I could ski over very thin ice and if I fell through it wasnt the end of the world It also meant if the worst came to the worst I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me Some pretty radical technology a radical approach but it worked perfectly Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology In  Shackletons Endurance expedition  there was  one of his crew a guy called Thomas OrdeLees He said The explorers of  if there is anything left to explore will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes Well OrdeLees guessed wrong by about eight years This is my pocket wireless telephone Iridium satellite phone The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket And every single day of the  days I was alone on the ice I was blogging live from my tent sending back a little diary piece sending back information on the distance Id covered  the ice conditions the temperature  and a daily photo Remember  we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world Last year blogging live from an expedition thats been described as  times as dangerous as Everest It wasnt all hightech This is navigating in whats called a whiteout When you get lots of mist low cloud the wind starts blowing the snow up You cant see an awful lot You can just see theres a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles Id navigate using the direction of the wind So kind of a weird combination of hightech and lowtech I got to the Pole on the th of May It took me  days to get there from Russia and there is nothing there Laughter There isnt even a pole at the Pole Theres nothing there purely because its sea ice Its drifting Stick a flag there leave it there pretty soon it will drift off usually towards Canada or Greenland I knew this but I was expecting something Strange mixture of feelings it was extremely warm by this stage a lot of open water around and of course elated that Id got there under my own steam but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada which was still  miles away were slim at best The only proof Ive got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS the little satellite navigation gadget You can just see  theres a nine and a string of zeros here Ninety degrees north  that is slap bang in the North Pole I took a photo of that Sat down on my sledge Did a sort of video diary piece Took a few photos I got my satellite phone out I warmed the battery up in my armpit I dialed three numbers I dialed my mum I dialed my girlfriend I dialed the CEO of my sponsor And I got three voicemails Video Ninety Its a special feeling The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet The  the whole world underneath me I finally got through to my mum She was at the queue of the supermarket She started crying She asked me to call her back I skied on for a week past the Pole I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue This was the last day I had on the ice When I spoke to the  my project management team they said Look Ben conditions are getting too dangerous There are huge areas of open water just south of your position Wed like to pick you up Ben could you please look for an airstrip This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call Id never tried to build an airstrip before Tony the expedition manager he said Look Ben youve got to find  meters of flat thick safe ice The only bit of ice I could find  it took me  hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip  was exactly  meters I could measure it with my skis I didnt tell Tony that I didnt tell the pilots that I thought itll have to do Video Oh oh oh oh oh oh It just about worked A pretty dramatic landing  the plane actually passed over four times and I was a bit worried it wasnt going to land at all The pilot I knew was called Troy I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed  a pretty emotional moment So I thought Ive got to compose myself for Troy Im supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type The plane taxied up to where I was standing The door opened This guy jumped out Hes about that tall He said Hi my name is Troy Laughter The copilot was a lady called Monica She sat there in a sort of handknitted jumper They were the least macho people Ive ever met but they made my day Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice we took a few photos He climbed up the ladder He said Just  just get in the back He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front and I climbed in the back Taxied up and down the runway a few times just to flatten it out a bit and he said Right Im going to  Im going to give it a go And he  Ive now learned that this is standard practice but it had me worried at the time He put his hand on the throttle You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit Its that little bar there He put his hand on the throttle Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his I thought God here we go Were were  this is all or nothing Rammed it forwards Bounced down the runway Just took off One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway banking I could see into the cockpit Troy battling the controls and he just took one hand off reached back flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can see on the wall And only from the air did I see the big picture Of course when youre on the ice you only ever see one obstacle at a time whether its a pressure ridge or theres a bit of water This is probably why I didnt get into trouble about the length of my airstrip I mean it really was starting to break up Why Im not an explorer in the traditional sense Im not skiing along drawing maps everyone knows where the North Pole is At the South Pole theres a big scientific base Theres an airstrip Theres a cafe and theres a tourist shop For me this is about exploring human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology Theyre the things that excite me And its also about potential on a personal level This for me is a chance to explore the limits  really push the limits of my own potential see how far they stretch And on a wider scale it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential just doing three or four or five percent of what theyre truly capable of So on a wider scale I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet Thats as close as I can come to summing that up The next question is how do you answer the call of nature at minus  The answer of course to which is a trade secret  and the last question whats next As quickly as possible if I have a minute left at the end Ill go into more detail Whats next Antarctica Its the coldest highest windiest and driest continent on Earth Late  early  there was a race to be the first to the South Pole the heart of the Antarctic continent If you include the coastal ice shelves you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf  its the big one down here  the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France Antarctica if you include the ice shelves is twice the size of Australia  its a big place And theres a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen the Norwegian  Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies  and Scott the British guy Captain Scott Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs all of which went wrong and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot They got to the Pole late January  to find a Norwegian flag already there There was a tent a letter to the Norwegian king And they turned around headed back to the coast and all five of them died on the return journey Since then no one has ever skied  this was  years ago  since then no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing  no one has ever made a return journey So thats the plan Two of us are doing it Thats pretty much it One final thought before I get to the toilet bit is  is I have a  and I meant to scan this and Ive forgotten  but I have a  I have a school report I was  years old and its framed above my desk at home It says Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile I think if Ive learned anything its this that no one else is the authority on your potential Youre the only person that decides how far you go and what youre capable of Ladies and gentlemen thats my story Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

90,This meeting has really been about a digital revolution but Id like to argue that its done we won Weve had a digital revolution but we dont need to keep having it And Id like to look after that to look what comes after the digital revolution So let me start projecting forward These are some projects Im involved in today at MIT looking what comes after computers This first one Internet Zero up here  this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag  about a dollar  that can go in every light bulb and doorknob and this is getting commercialized very quickly And whats interesting about it isnt the cost its the way it encodes the Internet It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet so you could send it optically you can communicate acoustically through a power line through RF It takes the original principle of the Internet which is internetworking computers and now lets devices internetwork That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero this internet of devices So this is the next step from there to here and this is getting commercialized today A step after that is a project on fungible computers Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded So half as much grain is half as much useful but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer and weve been trying to make computers that work that way So what you see in the background is a prototype This was from a thesis of a student Bill Butow now at Intel who wondered why instead of making bigger and bigger chips you dont make small chips put them in a viscous medium and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch And thats what you see here On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made but theres no frame buffer IO processor any of that stuff  its just this material Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully this is a raw material If you add twice as much of it you have twice as much display If you shoot a gun through the middle nothing happens If you need more resource you just apply more computer So thats the step after this  of computing as a raw material Thats still conventional bits the step after that is  this is an earlier prototype in the lab this is highspeed video slowed down Now integrating chemistry in computation where the bits are bubbles This is showing making bits this is showing  once again slowed down so you can see it bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and demultiplexing So now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information And ultimately these are some slides from an early project I did computing where the bits are stored quantummechanically in the nuclei of atoms so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms and they lead to the following recognition We all know weve had a digital revolution but what is that Well Shannon took us in the s from here to here from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet And he proved the first threshold theorem that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device And thats when we got the Internet Von Neumann in the s did the same thing for computing he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect This was the last great analog computer at MIT a differential analyzer and the more you ran it the worse the answer got After Von Neumann we have the Pentium where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner A stateoftheart airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal or you maybe melt some plastic A billiondollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize  you spread stuff around and bake it All the intelligence is external to the system the materials dont have information Yesterday you heard about molecular biology which fundamentally computes to build Its an information processing system Weve had digital revolutions in communication and computation but precisely the same idea precisely the same math Shannon and Von Neuman did hasnt yet come out to the physical world So inspired by that colleagues in this program  the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT  which is a group of people like me who never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science I would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science   because the canon  computer science  many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in  and natures a much more powerful computer than that So youll hear tomorrow from Saul Griffith He was one of the first students to emerge from this program We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically where you write a code much like protein folding that specifies their structure So theres no feedback to a tool metrology the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated So you can for example do that You can do other things Thats in D It works in D The video on the upper right  I wont show for time  shows selfreplication templating so something can make something that can make something and were doing that now over maybe nine orders of magnitude Those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly  so much like the magnets but now on nanometer scales Laser micromachining essentially D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems all the way up to building buildings not by having blueprints but having the parts code for the structure of the building So these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication Computers that dont control tools but computers that are tools where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits Now to do that  with your tax dollars thank you  I bought all these machines We made a modest proposal to the NSF We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale all in one place because you cant segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale So we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micromachining systems But I had a problem Once I had all these machines I was spending too much time teaching students to use them So I started teaching a class modestly called How To Make Almost Anything And that wasnt meant to be provocative it was just for a few research students But the first day of class looked like this You know hundreds of people came in begging all my life Ive been waiting for this class Ill do anything to do it Then theyd ask can you teach it at MIT It seems too useful And then the next   surprising thing was they werent there to do research They were there because they wanted to make stuff They had no conventional technical background At the end of a semester they integrated their skills Ill show an old video Kelly was a sculptor and this is what she did with her semester project Video Kelly Hi Im Kelly and this is my scream buddy Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream but you cant because youre at work or youre in a classroom or youre watching your children or youre in any number of situations where its just not permitted Well scream buddy is a portable space for screaming When a user screams into scream buddy their scream is silenced It is also recorded for later release where when and how the user chooses Scream Laughter Applause So Einstein would like this This student made a web browser for parrots  lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots This students made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove youre awake this is one that defends  a dress that defends your personal space This isnt technology for communication its technology to prevent it This is a device that lets you see your music This is a student who made a machine that makes machines and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing Just year after year  and I finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person You dont need this for what you can get in WalMart you need this for what makes you unique Ken Olsen famously said nobody needs a computer in the home But you dont use it for inventory and payroll DEC is now twice bankrupt You dont need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it You need it for what makes you unique just like personalization So with that in turn  million dollars today does this  years from now well make Star Trek replicators that make anything The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication Today when you spend that much of your money theres a government requirement to do outreach which often means classes at a local school a website  stuff thats just not that exciting So I made a deal with my NSF program managers that instead of talking about it Id give people the tools This wasnt meant to be provocative or important but we put together these Fab Labs Its about  dollars in equipment that approximate both what the  million dollars does and where its going A laser cutter to do pressfit assembly with D from D a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics a micron scale numericallycontrolled milling machine for precise structures programming tools for less than a dollar nanosecond microcontrollers It lets you work from microns and microseconds on up and they exploded around the world This wasnt scheduled but they went from innercity Boston to Pobal in India to SecondiTakoradi on Ghanas coast to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa to the far north of Norway uncovering or helping uncover for all the attention to the digital divide we would find unused computers in all these places A farmer in a rural village  a kid needs to measure and modify the world not just get information about it on a screen That theres really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses So in place after place we saw this same progression that wed open one of these Fab Labs where we didnt  this is too crazy to think of We didnt think this up that we would get pulled to these places wed open it The first step was just empowerment You can see it in their face just this joy of I can do it This is a girl in innercity Boston who had just done a hightech ondemand craft sale in the inner city community center It goes on from there to serious handson technical education informally out of schools In Ghana we had set up one of these labs We designed a network sensor and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night  Video Kids I love the Fab Lab  her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor So she insisted on fabbing the board learning how to stuff it learning how to program it She didnt really know what she was doing or why she was doing it but she knew she just had to do it There was something electric about it This is late at you know  oclock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time And Ive shown this to engineers at big companies and they say they cant do this Any one thing shes doing they can do better but its distributed over many people and many sites and they cant do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing Video Girl My name is Valentina Kofi I am eight years old I made a stacking board And again that was just for the joy of it Then these labs started doing serious problem solving  instrumentation for agriculture in India steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana highgain antennas in thin client computers And then in turn businesses started to grow like making these antennas And finally the lab started doing invention Were learning more from them than were giving them I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box  which as you see up there thats becoming a business  but their design was better than Sauls design at MIT so theres now three students at MIT doing their theses on scaling the work of eightyearold children because they had better designs Real invention is happening in these labs And I still kept  so in the last year Ive been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this and I keep saying but this isnt the real thing Wait like  years and then well be done And I finally got whats been going on This is Kernigan and Ritchie inventing UNIX on a PDP PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers They were tens of thousands of dollars hard to use but they brought computing down to work groups and everything we do today happened there These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP The projection of digital fabrication isnt a projection for the future we are now in the PDP era We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then It was very chaotic it wasnt sort of clear what was going on In the same sense we are now today in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication The only problem with that is it breaks everybodys boundaries In DC I go to every agency that wants to talk you know in the Bay Area I go to every organization you can think of  they all want to talk about it but it breaks their organizational boundaries In fact its illegal for them in many cases to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me its the social engineering That the lab in far north of Norway  this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because thats where the satellites are  the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it so they built this extraordinary village for the lab This isnt a university its not a company Its essentially a village for invention its a village for the outliers in society and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs all around the world So this program has split into an NGO foundation a Fab Foundation to support the scaling a micro VC fund The person who runs it nicely describes it as machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses its a cross between microfinance and VC to do fanout and then the research partnerships back at MIT for whats making it possible So Id like to leave you with two thoughts Theres been a sea change in aid from topdown megaprojects to bottomup grassroots microfinance investing in the roots so that everybodys got that thats what works But we still look at technology as topdown megaprojects Computing communication energy for the rest of the planet are these topdown megaprojects If this room full of heroes is just clever enough you can solve the problems The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet arent just technical sinks theyre sources The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems I thought thats the projection  years hence into the future but its where we are today It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering but its here today And finally any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show Moores law but my favorite version  this is Gordon Moores original one from his original paper  and whats happened is year after year after year weve scaled and weve scaled and weve scaled and weve scaled and weve scaled and weve scaled and weve scaled and weve scaled and theres this looming bug of whats going to happen at the end of Moores law this ultimate bug is coming But were coming to appreciate is the transition from D to D from programming bits to programming atoms turns the ends of Moores law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature So were just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication where the output of computation programs the physical world So together these two projects answer questions I hadnt asked carefully The class at MIT shows the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world is technology for a market of one personal expression in technology that touches a passion unlike anything Ive seen in technology for a very long time And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide people locally developing solutions to local problems Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

91,I want to start with a story a la Seth Godin from when I was  years old My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater  at least I thought it was beautiful And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest that were also fuzzy And I wore it whenever I could thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned Until one day in ninth grade when I was standing with a number of the football players And my body had clearly changed and Matt who was undeniably my nemesis in high school said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again Fast forward   years later Im a yearold kid Im working in Kigali Rwanda jogging through the steep slopes when I see  feet in front of me a little boy   years old  running toward me wearing my sweater And Im thinking no this is not possible But so curious I run up to the child  of course scaring the living bejesus out of him  grab him by the collar turn it over and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater I tell that story because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth We so often dont realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia and moved its way into the larger industry which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia Which was a very good thing providing low cost clothing And at the same time certainly in Rwanda it destroyed the local retailing industry Not to say that it shouldnt have but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses So Im going to stick in Rwanda circa   where I was doing two things I had started a bakery with  unwed mothers We were called the Bad News Bears and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali which was not hard because there were no snacks before us And because we had a good business model we actually did it and I watched these women transform on a microlevel But at the same time I started a microfinance bank and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen which is the grandfather of all microfinance banks which now is a worldwide movement  you talk about a meme  but then it was quite new especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade We got a lot of things right We focused on a business model we insisted on skin in the game The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses earn more income so they could take care of their families better What we didnt understand what was happening all around us with the confluence of fear ethnic strife and certainly an aid game if you will that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda that at that time  percent of the budget was all foreign aid The genocide happened in  seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream And the good news was that the institution the banking institution lasted In fact it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country The bakery was completely wiped out but the lessons for me were that accountability counts  got to build things with people on the ground using business models where as Steven Levitt would say the incentives matter Understand however complex we may be incentives matter So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist on the one hand I absolutely agree with him and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G  that the world because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof  the world is talking about global poverty the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life Its thrilling And at the same time what keeps me up at night is a fear that well look at the victories of the G   billion dollars in increased aid to Africa  billion in reduced debt  as the victory as more than chapter one as our moral absolution And in fact what we need to do is see that as chapter one celebrate it close it and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution all about the howto And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today its that the only way to end poverty to make it history is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable If we do that we really can make poverty history And it was that  that whole philosophy  that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called Acumen Fund which is trying to build some miniblueprints for how we might do that in water health and housing in Pakistan India Kenya Tanzania and Egypt And I want to talk a little bit about that and some of the examples so you can see what it is that were doing But before I do this  and this is another one of my pet peeves  I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are Because we too often talk about them as these strong huge masses of people yearning to be free when in fact its quite an amazing story On a macro level four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day Thats who we talk about when we think about the poor If you aggregate it its the third largest economy on Earth and yet most of these people go invisible Where we typically work theres people making between one and three dollars a day Who are these people They are farmers and factory workers They work in government offices Theyre drivers They are domestics They typically pay for critical goods and services like water like healthcare like housing and they pay  to  times what their middleclass counterparts pay  certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi The poor also are willing to make and do make smart decisions if you give them that opportunity So two examples One is in India where there are  million farmers most of whom make less than two dollars a day Where we work in Aurangabad the land is extraordinarily parched You see people on average making  cents to a dollar This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar What he did was see what was happening in Israel larger approaches and figure out how to do a drip irrigation which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock But previously its only been created for largescale farms so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre A couple of principles build small Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor This family Sarita and her husband bought a dollar unit when they were living in a  literally a threewalled leanto with a corrugated iron roof After one harvest they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarteracre A couple of years later I meet them They now make four dollars a day which is pretty much middle class for India and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house And I swear you could see the future in that womans eyes Something I truly believe You cant talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage  for five dollars you can save a life Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year  to  million cases are reported Its estimated that Africa loses about  billion dollars a year to the disease Five dollars can save a life We can send people to the moon we can see if theres life on Mars  why cant we get fivedollar nets to  million people The question though is not Why cant we The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves A lot of hurdles One production is too low Two price is too high Three this is a good road in  right near where our factory is located Distribution is a nightmare but not impossible We started by making a dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these longlasting fiveyear nets Here are just some pictures of the factory Today three years later the company has employed another thousand women It contributes about  dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania Its the largest company in Tanzania The throughput rate right now is  million nets three million by the end of the year We hope to have seven million at the end of next year So the production side is working On the distribution side though as a world we have a lot of work to do Right now  percent of these nets are being bought by the UN and then given primarily to people around Africa Were looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa people Their women And so I want you to meet Jacqueline my namesake  years old If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania Im telling you she could run Wall Street She runs two of the lines and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house She makes about two dollars a day is creating an education fund and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed And so when I told her about our idea  that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others  she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up We took a lesson from IDEO one of our favorite companies and quickly did a prototyping on this and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives She brought  of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets five dollars apiece despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one and we learned a lot about how you sell things Not coming in with our own notions because she didnt even talk about malaria until the very end First she talked about comfort status beauty These nets she said you put them on the floor bugs leave your house Children can sleep through the night the house looks beautiful you hang them in the window And weve started making curtains and not only is it beautiful but people can see status  that you care about your children Only then did she talk about saving your childrens lives A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor I want to end just by saying that theres enormous opportunity to make poverty history To do it right we have to build business models that matter that are scaleable and that work with Africans Indians people all over the developing world who fit in this category to do it themselves Because at the end of the day its about engagement Its about understanding that people really dont want handouts that they want to make their own decisions they want to solve their own problems and that by engaging with them not only do we create much more dignity for them but for us as well And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have  to make poverty history  by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an usandthem world and realizing that its about all of us and the kind of world that we together want to live in and share Thank you

92,"About  years ago I took on the task
to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students That was after having spent about  years together with African institutions
studying hunger in Africa so I was sort of expected
to know a little about the world And I started in our medical university
Karolinska Institute an undergraduate course
called Global Health But when you get that opportunity
you get a little nervous I thought these students coming to us actually have the highest grade
you can get in Swedish college systems  so I thought maybe they know everything
Im going to teach them about So I did a pretest when they came And one of the questions
from which I learned a lot was this one Which country has the highest
child mortality of these five pairs I put them together
so that in each pair of country one has twice the child
mortality of the other And this means that
its much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data I wont put you at a test here
but its Turkey which is highest there Poland
Russia Pakistan and South Africa And these were the results
of the Swedish students I did it so I got the confidence interval
which is pretty narrow and I got happy of course a  right answer
out of five possible That means that there was a place
for a professor of international health and for my course But one late night
when I was compiling the report I really realized my discovery I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less
about the world than the chimpanzees Because the chimpanzee
would score half right if I gave them two bananas
with Sri Lanka and Turkey They would be right half of the cases
But the students are not there The problem for me was not ignorance
it was preconceived ideas I did also an unethical study of the professors
of the Karolinska Institute that hands out
the Nobel Prize in Medicine and they are on par
with the chimpanzee there This is where I realized that
there was really a need to communicate because the data
of whats happening in the world and the child health
of every country is very well aware We did this software
which displays it like this every bubble here is a country This country over here is China This is India The size of the bubble is the population and on this axis here
I put fertility rate Because my students what they said when they looked upon the world
and I asked them What do you really
think about the world Well I first discovered
that the textbook was Tintin mainly And they said The world
is still we and them And we is Western world
and them is Third World And what do you mean
with Western world I said Well thats long life and small family and Third World is short life
and large family So this is what I could display here I put fertility rate here
number of children per woman one two three four
up to about eight children per woman We have very good data
since    about  on the size of families in all countries The error margin is narrow Here I put life expectancy at birth from  years in some countries
up to about  years And  there was really
a group of countries here that was industrialized countries and they had small families
and long lives And these were the developing countries they had large families
and they had relatively short lives Now what has happened since 
We want to see the change Are the students right
Is it still two types of countries Or have these developing countries
got smaller families and they live here Or have they got longer lives
and live up there Lets see We stopped the world then This is all UN statistics
that have been available Here we go Can you see there Its China there moving against
better health there improving there All the green Latin American countries
are moving towards smaller families Your yellow ones here
are the Arabic countries and they get longer life
but not larger families The Africans are the green here
They still remain here This is India Indonesia
is moving on pretty fast In the s here you have Bangladesh
still among the African countries But now Bangladesh 
its a miracle that happens in the s the imams start to promote
family planning They move up into that corner And in the s we have
the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy
of the African countries and all the rest of them
move up into the corner where we have long lives and small family
and we have a completely new world Applause ends Let me make a comparison directly between the United States
of America and Vietnam  America had small families and long life Vietnam had large families
and short lives And this is what happens the data during the war indicate
that even with all the death there was an improvement
of life expectancy By the end of the year
the family planning started in Vietnam they went for smaller families And the United States up there
is getting for longer life keeping family size And in the s now
they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy and it moves faster even than social life And today we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy
and the same family size here in Vietnam  as in United States 
by the end of the war If we dont look in the data I think we all underestimate
the tremendous change in Asia which was in social change
before we saw the economical change Lets move over to another way here
in which we could display the distribution
in the world of the income This is the world distribution
of income of people One dollar  dollars
or  dollars per day Theres no gap between rich
and poor any longer This is a myth Theres a little hump here But there are people all the way And if we look where the income ends up this is  percent
the worlds annual income And the richest  percent they take out of that about  percent And the poorest  percent
they take about two percent And this shows that the concept
of developing countries is extremely doubtful We think about aid like these people here giving aid
to these people here But in the middle we have
most of the world population and they have now
 percent of the income We heard it in other forms
And who are these Where are the different countries
I can show you Africa This is Africa  the world population most in poverty This is OECD The rich country
The country club of the UN And they are over here on this side
Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD And this is Latin America It has everything on this Earth
from the poorest to the richest in Latin America And on top of that
we can put East Europe we can put East Asia
and we put South Asia And how did it look like
if we go back in time to about  Then there was more of a hump And we have most who lived
in absolute poverty were Asians The problem in the world
was the poverty in Asia And if I now let the world move forward you will see that
while population increases there are hundreds of millions
in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty and this is the pattern we have today And the best projection
from the World Bank is that this will happen and we will not have a divided world Well have most people in the middle Of course its a logarithmic scale here but our concept of economy
is growth with percent We look upon it as a possibility
of percentile increase If I change this and take GDP per capita
instead of family income and I turn these individual data into regional data
of gross domestic product and I take the regions down here the size of the bubble
is still the population And you have the OECD there
and you have subSaharan Africa there and we take off the Arab states there coming both from Africa and from Asia
and we put them separately and we can expand this axis
and I can give it a new dimension here by adding the social values
there child survival Now I have money on that axis and I have the possibility
of children to survive there In some countries  of children
survive to five years of age others only  And here it seems
there is a gap between OECD Latin America East Europe East Asia Arab states South Asia
and subSaharan Africa The linearity is very strong
between child survival and money But let me split subSaharan Africa Health is there
and better health is up there I can go here and I can split
subSaharan Africa into its countries And when it burst the size of its country bubble
is the size of the population Sierra Leone down there
Mauritius is up there Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers
and they could sell their sugar  they could sell their textiles  on equal terms as the people
in Europe and North America Theres a huge difference between Africa
And Ghana is here in the middle In Sierra Leone humanitarian aid Here in Uganda development aid Here time to invest
there you can go for a holiday Its a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make
 that its equal everything I can split South Asia here
Indias the big bubble in the middle But a huge difference
between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka I can split Arab states How are they Same climate same culture
same religion  huge difference Even between neighbors Yemen civil war United Arab Emirates money
which was quite equally and well used Not as the myth is And that includes all the children
of the foreign workers who are in the country Data is often better than you think
Many people say data is bad There is an uncertainty margin
but we can see the difference here Cambodia Singapore The differences are much bigger
than the weakness of the data East Europe Soviet economy
for a long time but they come out after  years
very very differently And there is Latin America Today we dont have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country
in Latin America Chile will have a lower child mortality
than Cuba within some few years from now Here we have highincome
countries in the OECD And we get the whole pattern
here of the world which is more or less like this And if we look at it how the world looks in  it starts to move This is Mao Tsetung
He brought health to China And then he died And then Deng Xiaoping came
and brought money to China and brought them
into the mainstream again And we have seen how countries
move in different directions like this so its sort of difficult to get
an example country which shows the pattern of the world But I would like to bring you back
to about here at  I would like to compare South Korea which is this one
with Brazil which is this one The label went away for me here And I would like to compare Uganda
which is there And I can run it forward like this And you can see how South Korea is making
a very very fast advancement whereas Brazil is much slower And if we move back again here
and we put on trails on them like this you can see again
that the speed of development is very very different and the countries are moving more or less
in the same rate as money and health but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first
than if you are wealthy first And to show that you can put
on the way of United Arab Emirates They came from here a mineral country They cached all the oil
they got all the money but health cannot be bought
at the supermarket You have to invest in health
You have to get kids into schooling You have to train health staff
You have to educate the population And Sheikh Zayed did that
in a fairly good way In spite of falling oil prices
he brought this country up here So weve got a much more mainstream
appearance of the world where all countries tend
to use their money better than they used in the past Now this is more or less if you look
at the average data of the countries  they are like this Now thats dangerous to use average data because there is such
a lot of difference within countries So if I go and look here
we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in  If I split Uganda theres quite
a difference within Uganda These are the quintiles of Uganda The richest  percent
of Ugandans are there The poorest are down there If I split South Africa its like this And if I go down and look at Niger where there was such
a terrible famine lastly its like this The  percent poorest
of Niger is out here and the  percent richest
of South Africa is there and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions
there should be in Africa Everything in this world exists in Africa And you cant discuss
universal access to HIV medicine for that quintile up here
with the same strategy as down here The improvement of the world
must be highly contextualized and its not relevant to have it
on regional level We must be much more detailed We find that students get
very excited when they can use this And even more policy makers
and the corporate sectors would like to see
how the world is changing Now why doesnt this take place Why are we not using the data we have We have data in the United Nations
in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other
nongovernmental organizations Because the data is hidden
down in the databases And the public is there
and the Internet is there but we have still not used it effectively All that information
we saw changing in the world does not include
publiclyfunded statistics There are some web pages
like this you know but they take some nourishment
down from the databases but people put prices on them
stupid passwords and boring statistics And this wont work So what is needed We have the databases Its not the new database you need We have wonderful design tools
and more and more are added up here So we started a nonprofit venture which linking data to design
we called Gapminder from the London Underground where they warn you mind the gap So we thought Gapminder was appropriate And we started to write software
which could link the data like this And it wasnt that difficult It took some person years
and we have produced animations You can take a data set and put it there We are liberating UN data
some few UN organization Some countries accept that
their databases can go out on the world but what we really need is
of course a search function A search function where we can copy
the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world And what do we hear when we go around Ive done anthropology
on the main statistical units Everyone says Its impossible
This cant be done Our information is so peculiar in detail so that cannot be searched
as others can be searched We cannot give the data
free to the students free to the entrepreneurs of the world But this is what we would
like to see isnt it The publiclyfunded data is down here And we would like flowers
to grow out on the Net And one of the crucial points
is to make them searchable and then people can use the different
design tool to animate it there And I have pretty good news for you I have good news that the present new Head of UN Statistics
he doesnt say its impossible He only says We cant do it And thats a quite clever guy huh So we can see a lot happening
in data in the coming years We will be able to look at income
distributions in completely new ways This is the income distribution
of China  This is the income distribution
of the United States  Almost no overlap And what has happened What has happened is this that China is growing
its not so equal any longer and its appearing here
overlooking the United States Almost like a ghost isnt it Its pretty scary But I think its very important
to have all this information We need really to see it And instead of looking at this I would like to end up by showing
the Internet users per  In this software we access
about  variables from all the countries quite easily It takes some time to change for this but on the axises you can quite easily
get any variable you would like to have And the thing would be
to get up the databases free to get them searchable
and with a second click to get them into the graphic formats
where you can instantly understand them Now statisticians dont like it because they say
that this will not show the reality we have to have statistical
analytical methods But this is hypothesisgenerating I end now with the world There the Internet is coming The number of Internet users
are going up like this This is the GDP per capita And its a new technology coming in
but then amazingly how well it fits to the economy
of the countries Thats why the  computer
will be so important But its a nice tendency Its as if the world
is flattening off isnt it These countries are lifting more
than the economy and will be very interesting
to follow this over the year as I would like you to be able to do
with all the publicly funded data Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

93,"Im going to talk to you about some stuff
thats in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other
things youve already heard and Ill try to make
some connections myself in case you missed them But I want to start with
what I call the official dogma The official dogma of what The official dogma of all Western
industrial societies And the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing
the welfare of our citizens the way to do that
is to maximize individual freedom The reason for this is both that freedom
is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile
essential to being human And because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things
that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf The way to maximize freedom
is to maximize choice The more choice people have
the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have This I think is so deeply embedded
in the water supply that it wouldnt occur
to anyone to question it And its also deeply
embedded in our lives Ill give you some examples of what modern progress
has made possible for us This is my supermarket Not such a big one I want to say just a word
about salad dressing  salad dressings in my supermarket if you dont count the 
extravirgin olive oils and  balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number
of your own salad dressings in the offchance that none of the 
the store has on offer suit you So this is what the supermarket is like And then you go
to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system  speakers CD player
tape player tuner amplifier  and in this one single
consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems We can construct sixandahalfmillion
different stereo systems out of the components
that are on offer in one store Youve got to admit
thats a lot of choice In other domains 
the world of communications There was a time when I was a boy when you could get any kind
of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from Ma Bell You rented your phone You didnt buy it One consequence of that by the way
is that the phone never broke And those days are gone We now have an almost
unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones These are cell phones of the future My favorite is the middle one  the MP player nose hair trimmer
and cr�me br�l�e torch And if by some chance you havent
seen that in your store yet you can rest assured
that one day soon you will And what this does is it leads people to walk
into their stores asking this question And do you know what the answer
to this question now is The answer is no It is not possible to buy a cell phone
that doesnt do too much So in other aspects of life that are much
more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true Health care It is no longer the case
in the United States that you go to the doctor
and the doctor tells you what to do Instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you
Well we could do A or we could do B A has these benefits and these risks B has these benefits and these risks What do you want to do And you say Doc what should I do And the doc says A has
these benefits and risks and B has these benefits and risks What do you want to do And you say If you were me
Doc what would you do And the doc says But Im not you And the result is 
we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but it really is a shifting
of the burden and the responsibility for decisionmaking from somebody
who knows something  namely the doctor  to somebody who knows nothing
and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape
to be making decisions  namely the patient Theres enormous marketing
of prescription drugs to people like you and me which if you think about it
makes no sense at all since we cant buy them Why do they market to us
if we cant buy them The answer is that they expect us
to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions
to be changed Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide is meant to indicate We dont inherit an identity
we get to invent it And we get to reinvent
ourselves as often as we like And that means that every day
when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind
of person you want to be With respect to marriage and family there was a time when the default
assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married
as soon as you could and then you started having kids
as soon as you could The only real choice was who not when and not what you did after Nowadays everything
is very much up for grabs I teach wonderfully intelligent students and I assign  percent
less work than I used to And its not because theyre less smart and its not because
theyre less diligent Its because they are preoccupied
asking themselves Should I get married or not
Should I get married now Should I get married later Should I have kids first
or a career first All of these are consuming questions And theyre going to answer
these questions whether or not it means
not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade
in my courses And indeed they should These are important questions to answer Work  we are blessed as Carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day
from any place on the planet  except the Randolph Hotel There is one corner by the way that Im not going to tell anybody about
where the WiFi actually works Im not telling you about it
because I want to use it So what this means this incredible freedom of choice
we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should
or shouldnt be working We can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our Blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps And even if theyre all shut off every minute that were watching
our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves Should I answer this cell phone call Should I respond to this email
Should I draft this letter And even if the answer
to the question is no its certainly going to make
the experience of your kids soccer game very different than it wouldve been So everywhere we look big things and small things
material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice And the world we used
to live in looked like this Well actually
they are written in stone That is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice And the world we now live in
looks like this The Ten Commandments DYI Kit And the question is
is this good news or bad news And the answer is yes We all know whats good about it so Im going to talk
about whats bad about it All of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people One effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis
rather than liberation With so many options to choose from people find it very difficult
to choose at all Ill give you one very
dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments
in voluntary retirement plans A colleague of mine got access
to investment records from Vanguard the gigantic mutualfund company of about a million employees
and about  different workplaces And what she found is that for every  mutual funds
the employer offered rate of participation
went down two percent You offer  funds   percent
fewer employees participate than if you only offer five Why Because with  funds to choose from its so damn hard to decide
which fund to choose that youll just put it off
until tomorrow And then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have
to eat dog food when they retire because they dont have
enough money put away it also means that making
the decision is so hard that they pass up significant
matching money from the employer By not participating they are passing up
as much as  dollars a year from the employer who would happily
match their contribution So paralysis is a consequence
of having too many choices And I think it makes
the world look like this And lastly for all eternity
French bleu cheese or ranch You really want to get the decision
right if its for all eternity right You dont want to pick the wrong
mutual fund or the wrong salad dressing So thats one effect The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome
the paralysis and make a choice we end up less satisfied
with the result of the choice than we would be if we had
fewer options to choose from And there are several reasons for this One of them is that with a lot of different
salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and its not perfect 
and what salad dressing is  its easy to imagine
you could have made a different choice that would have been better And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you
to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts
from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision The more options there are
the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing
about the option that you chose Second what economists
call opportunity costs Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way
in which we value things depends on what we compare them to Well when there are lots
of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine
the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied
with the alternative that youve chosen Heres an example I cant stop thinking about those other
available parking spaces on W th street Sorry if youre not New Yorkers Heres what youre
supposed to be thinking Heres this couple on the Hamptons Very expensive real estate Gorgeous beach Beautiful day
They have it all to themselves What could be better Well damn it this guy is thinking Its August Everybody
in my Manhattan neighborhood is away I could be parking
right in front of my building And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have
a great parking space Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction
we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific And the more options
there are to consider the more attractive
features of these options are going to be reflected
by us as opportunity costs Heres another example Now this cartoon makes a lot of points It makes points about living
in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly But one point it makes is that whenever
youre choosing one thing youre choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features and its going to make
what youre doing less attractive Third escalation of expectations This hit me when I went
to replace my jeans I wear jeans almost all the time There was a time
when jeans came in one flavor and you bought them
and they fit like crap they were incredibly uncomfortable if you wore them
and washed them enough times they started to feel OK I went to replace my jeans after years
of wearing these old ones and I said I want
a pair of jeans Heres my size And the shopkeeper said Do you want slim fit
easy fit relaxed fit You want button fly or zipper fly
You want stonewashed or acidwashed Do you want them distressed You want boot cut tapered blah blah
On and on he went My jaw dropped And after I recovered I said I want the kind that used
to be the only kind He had no idea what that was so I spent an hour trying on
all these damn jeans and I walked out of the store  truth  with the bestfitting jeans
I had ever had I did better All this choice made
it possible for me to do better But  I felt worse Why I wrote a whole book
to try to explain this to myself The reason  The reason I felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good
a pair of jeans should be went up I had very low no particular expectations
when they only came in one flavor When they came in  flavors damn it
one of them shouldve been perfect And what I got was good
but it wasnt perfect And so I compared what I got
to what I expected and what I got was disappointing
in comparison to what I expected Adding options to peoples lives cant help but increase
the expectations people have about how good those options will be And what thats going to produce
is less satisfaction with results even when theyre good results Nobody in the world
of marketing knows this It all looks so great
I cant wait to be disappointed Because if they did you wouldnt all know
what this was about The truth is more like this Everything was better back
when everything was worse The reason that everything was better
back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences
that were a pleasant surprise Nowadays the world we live in 
we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation  the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good
as you expect it to be You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations
my expectations have gone through the roof The secret to happiness 
this is what you all came for  the secret to happiness is low expectations Youll do I want to say  just a little autobiographical moment  that I actually am married to a wife and shes really quite wonderful I couldnt have done better I didnt settle But settling isnt
always such a bad thing Finally  One consequence of buying
a badfitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied
and you ask why whos responsible the answer is clear
the world is responsible What could you do When there are hundreds
of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why whos responsible It is equally clear that the answer
to the question is you You could have done better With a hundred different kinds
of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure And so when people make decisions and even though the results
of the decisions are good they feel disappointed about them they blame themselves Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world
in the last generation I believe a significant  not the only
but a significant  contributor to this explosion of depression
and also suicide is that people have experiences
that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain
these experiences to themselves they think theyre at fault And so the net result is that we do
better in general objectively and we feel worse So let me remind you This is the official dogma
the one that we all take to be true and its all false It is not true Theres no question that some choice
is better than none but it doesnt follow from that that more choice
is better than some choice Theres some magical amount
I dont know what it is Im pretty confident that we have
long since passed the point where options improve our welfare Now as a policy matter 
Im almost done  as a policy matter
the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice in industrial societies
is material affluence There are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them where their problem
is not that they have too much choice Their problem
is that they have too little So the stuff Im talking about
is the peculiar problem of modern affluent Western societies And what is so frustrating
and infuriating is this Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive
and difficulttoinstall child seats dont help Its a waste of money What Im telling you is that these expensive
complicated choices  its not simply that they dont help They actually hurt They actually make us worse off If some of what enables
people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies
in which people have too few options not only would those
peoples lives be improved but ours would be improved also which is what economists call
a Paretoimproving move Income redistribution will make
everyone better off  not just poor people  because of how all this excess
choice plagues us So to conclude You can be anything
you want to be  no limits Youre supposed to read this cartoon
and being a sophisticated person say Ah What does this fish know You know nothing is possible
in this fishbowl Impoverished imagination
a myopic view of the world  and thats the way I read it at first The more I thought about it however the more I came to the view
that this fish knows something Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl
so that everything is possible you dont have freedom You have paralysis If you shatter this fishbowl
so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction You increase paralysis
and you decrease satisfaction Everybody needs a fishbowl This one is almost
certainly too limited  perhaps even for the fish
certainly for us But the absence of some metaphorical
fishbowl is a recipe for misery and I suspect disaster Thank you very much ",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

94,"Its wonderful to be back I love this wonderful gathering And you must be wondering What on earth Have they put up the wrong slide No no Look at this magnificent beast and ask the question Who designed it This is TED this is
Technology Entertainment Design and theres a dairy cow Its a quite wonderfully designed animal And I was thinking
how do I introduce this And I thought well maybe
that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer you know Poems are made by fools
like me but only God can make a tree And you might say
Well God designed the cow But of course God got a lot of help This is the ancestor of cattle This is the aurochs And it was designed by natural selection the process of natural selection
over many millions of years And then it became domesticated
thousands of years ago And human beings became its stewards and without even knowing
what they were doing they gradually redesigned it
and redesigned it and redesigned it And then more recently they really began
to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what
the parts were how they worked and how they might be optimized 
how they might be made better Now why am I talking about cows Because I want to say that
much the same thing is true of religions Religions are natural phenomena 
theyre just as natural as cows They have evolved over millennia They have a biological base
just like the aurochs They have become domesticated and human beings have been redesigning
their religions for thousands of years This is TED and I want
to talk about design Because what Ive been doing
for the last four years  really since the first time you saw me  some of you saw me at TED
when I was talking about religion  and in the last four years Ive been working
just about nonstop on this topic And you might say its about
the reverse engineering of religions Now that very idea I think
strikes terror in many people or anger or anxiety
of one sort or another And that is the spell
that I want to break I want to say no religions
are an important natural phenomenon We should study them
with the same intensity that we study all the other
important natural phenomena like global warming as we heard
so eloquently last night from Al Gore Todays religions are brilliantly
designed  brilliantly designed They are immensely powerful
social institutions and many of their features
can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of
by reverse engineering And as with the cow theres a mixture
of evolutionary design  designed by natural selection itself  and intelligent design  more or less intelligent design  and redesigned by human beings who are trying
to redesign their religions You dont do book talks at TED but Im going to have
just one slide about my book because there is one message in it which I think this group
really needs to hear And I would be very interested
to get your responses to this Its the one policy proposal
that I make in the book at this time when I claim
not to know enough about religion to know what other
policy proposals to make And its one that echoes remarks
that youve heard already today Heres my proposal Im going to just take a couple
of minutes to explain it Education on world religions
for all of our children  in primary school in high school in public schools in private schools
and in home schooling So what Im proposing is just as we require reading writing
arithmetic American history so we should have a curriculum on facts
about all the religions of the world  about their history
about their creeds about their texts their music their symbolisms
their prohibitions their requirements And this should be presented
factually straightforwardly with no particular spin
to all of the children in the country And as long as you teach them that you can teach them anything else you like That I think is maximal tolerance
for religious freedom As long as you inform your children
about other religions then you may  and as early as you like
and whatever you like  teach them whatever creed
you want them to learn But also let them know
about other religions Now why do I say that Because democracy depends
on an informed citizenship Informed consent is the very bedrock
of our understanding of democracy Misinformed consent is not worth it Its like a coin flip
it doesnt count really Democracy depends on informed consent This is the way we treat people
as responsible adults Now children below the age of consent
are a special case Parents  Im going to use a word
that Pastor Rick just used  parents are stewards of their children They dont own them You cant own your children You have a responsibility to the world to the state to them
to take care of them right You may teach them whatever creed
you think is most important but I say you have a responsibility
to let them be informed about all the other creeds
in the world too The reason Ive taken this time
is Ive been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this One reviewer for a Roman Catholic
newspaper called it totalitarian It strikes me as practically libertarian Is it totalitarian to require
reading writing and arithmetic I dont think so All Im saying is  and facts facts only
no values just facts  about all the worlds religions Another reviewer called it hilarious Well Im really bothered by the fact that anybody would think
that was hilarious It seems to me to be such a plausible natural extension of the democratic
principles we already have that Im shocked to think anybody
would find that just ridiculous I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity
of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping
their children ignorant of other faiths I dont think thats defensible But Id really be pleased
to get your answers on that  any reactions to that  later But now Im going to move on Back to the cow This picture which I pulled
off the web  the fellow on the left is really
an important part of this picture Thats the steward Cows couldnt live without human
stewards  theyre domesticated Theyre a sort of ectosymbiont They depend on us for their survival And Pastor Rick
was just talking about sheep Im going to talk about sheep too Theres a lot of serendipitous
convergence here How clever it was of sheep
to acquire shepherds Think of what this got them They could outsource all their problems protection from predators
foodfinding   health maintenance The only cost in most flocks 
not even this  a loss of free mating What a deal How clever of sheep you might say Except of course
it wasnt the sheeps cleverness We all know sheep are not exactly rocket
scientists  theyre not very smart It wasnt the cleverness
of the sheep at all They were clueless But it was a very clever move Whose clever move was it It was the clever move
of natural selection itself Francis Crick the codiscoverer
of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson once joked about what he called
Orgels Second Rule Leslie Orgel is a molecular
biologist brilliant guy and Orgels Second Rule is Evolution is cleverer than you are Now that is not Intelligent Design 
not from Francis Crick Evolution is cleverer than you are If you understand Orgels Second Rule
then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement
is basically a hoax The designs discovered
by the process of natural selection are brilliant unbelievably brilliant Again and again biologists are fascinated
with the brilliance of whats discovered But the process itself is without purpose without foresight without design When I was here four years ago I told the story about an ant
climbing a blade of grass And why the ant was doing it
was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed
to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce So it was sort of a spooky story And I think some people
may have misunderstood Lancet flukes arent smart I submit that the intelligence
of a lancet fluke is down there somewhere between petunia and carrot Theyre not really bright
They dont have to be The lesson we learn from this is you dont have to have a mind
to be a beneficiary The design is there in nature
but its not in anybodys head It doesnt have to be Thats the way evolution works Question Was domestication
good for sheep It was great for their genetic fitness And here I want to remind you
of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made
at TED three years ago Heres what he said Ten thousand years ago
at the dawn of agriculture human population plus livestock and pets was approximately a tenth of one percent
of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass That was just  years ago Yesterday in biological terms What is it today Does anybody
remember what he told us  percent That is what we have done on this planet Now I talked to Paul afterwards 
I wanted to check to find out how hed calculated this and get
the sources and so forth  and he also gave me a paper
that he had written on this And there was a passage in it
which he did not present here and I think it is so good
Im going to read it to you Over billions of years
on a unique sphere chance has painted
a thin covering of life complex improbable
wonderful and fragile Suddenly we humans 
a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks
and balances inherent in nature  have grown in population
technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power We now wield the paintbrush We heard about the atmosphere
as a thin layer of varnish Life itself is just a thin coat
of paint on this planet And were the ones
that hold the paintbrush And how can we do that The key to our domination
of the planet is culture And the key to culture is religion Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth They would be puzzled by many things Anybody know what this is
Ill tell you what it is This is a million people gathering
on the banks of the Ganges in  perhaps the largest single gathering
of human beings ever as seen from satellite photograph Heres a big crowd Heres another crowd in Mecca Martians would be amazed by this Theyd want to know how it originated what it was for
and how it perpetuates itself Actually Im going to pass over this The ant isnt alone Theres all sorts of wonderful cases
of species which  in that case  A parasite gets into a mouse
and needs to get into the belly of a cat And it turns the mouse
into Mighty Mouse makes it fearless so it runs out in the open
where itll be eaten by a cat True story In other words we have these hijackers  youve seen this slide before
from four years ago  a parasite that infects the brain
and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause
other than ones own genetic fitness Does that ever happen to us Yes it does  quite wonderfully The Arabic word Islam
means submission It means surrender of selfinterest
to the will of Allah But Im not just talking about Islam Im talking also about Christianity This is a parchment music page
that I found in a Paris bookstall  years ago And on it it says in Latin Semen est verbum Dei
Sator autem Christus The word of God is the seed
and the sower of the seed is Christ Same idea Well not quite But in fact Christians too  glory in the fact
that they have surrendered to God Ill give you a few quotes The heart of worship is surrender Surrendered people obey Gods words
even if it doesnt make sense Those words are by Rick Warren Those are from The Purpose Driven Life And I want to turn now briefly
to talk about that book which Ive read Youve all got a copy and youve just heard the man And what I want to do now
is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint because I think its actually
a brilliant book First of all the goal  and you
heard just now what the goal is  its to bring purpose to the lives
of millions and he has succeeded Is it a good goal In itself Im sure
we all agree it is a wonderful goal Hes absolutely right There are lots of people out there
who dont have purpose in their life and bringing purpose to their life
is a wonderful goal I give him an A on this Is the goal achieved Yes Thirty million copies of this book Al Gore eat your heart out Just exactly what Al is trying
to do Rick is doing This is a fantastic achievement And the means  how does he do it Its a brilliant redesign
of traditional religious themes  updating them quietly dropping
obsolete features putting new interpretations
on other features This is the evolution of religion thats
been going on for thousands of years and hes just the latest
brilliant practitioner of it I dont have to tell you this
you just heard the man Excellent insights into human psychology
wise advice on every page Moreover he invites us
to look under the hood I really appreciated that For instance he has an appendix
where he explains his choice of translations
of different Bible verses The book is clear vivid accessible
beautifully formatted Just enough repetition Thats really important Every time you read it or say it
you make another copy in your brain Every time you read it or say it
you make another copy in your brain With me everybody  Audience and Dan Dennett
Every time you read it or say it you make another copy in your brain Thank you And now we come to my problem Because Im absolutely sincere
in my appreciation of all that I said about this book But I wish it were better I have some problems with the book And it would just be insincere of me
not to address those problems I wish he could do this with a revision a Mark  version of his book The truth will set you free Thats what it says in the Bible and its something
that I want to live by too My problem is some of the bits in it
I dont think are true Now some of this
is a difference of opinion And thats not my main complaint
thats worth mentioning Heres a passage  its very much
what he said anyway If there was no God
we would all be accidents the result of astronomical
random chance in the Universe You could stop reading this book
because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond
your brief years on Earth Now I just do not believe that By the way I find  Homer Groenings
film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim Yes there is meaning and a reason
for right or wrong We dont need a belief in God
to be good or to have meaning in us But that as I said
is just a difference of opinion Thats not what Im really worried about How about this God designed
this planets environment just so we could live in it Im afraid that a lot of people
take that sentiment to mean that we dont have to do
the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard
to get us to do I am not happy with that sentiment at all And then I find this All the evidence
available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that
the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind
as its fundamental goal and purpose a whole in which all facets
of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact Well thats Michael Denton
Hes a creationist And here I think Wait a minute
I read this again I read it three or four times and I think Is he really endorsing
Intelligent Design Is he endorsing creationism here And you cant tell So Im sort of thinking
Well I dont know I dont know if I want
to get upset with this yet But then I read on and I read this
First Noah had never seen rain because prior to the Flood God irrigated
the earth from the ground up I wish that sentence werent in there
because I think it is false And I think that thinking this way
about the history of the planet after weve just been hearing
about the history of the planet over millions of years discourages people
from scientific understanding Now Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information
in a very interesting way Heres one God deliberately shaped
and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail
that created you I think thats false Now maybe we want to treat it
as metaphorical Heres another one For instance
your brain can store  trillion facts Your mind can handle
 decisions a second Well it would be interesting
to find the interpretation where I would accept that There might be some way
of treating that as true Anthropologists have noted
that worship is a universal urge hardwired by God into
the very fiber of our being  an inbuilt need to connect with God Well the sense of which I agree with him except I think it has
an evolutionary explanation And what I find
deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing
that if you want to be moral if you want to have meaning in your life you have to be an Intelligent Designer you have to deny the theory of evolution
by natural selection And I think on the contrary that it is very important
to solving the worlds problems that we take evolutionary
biology seriously Whose truth are we going to listen to Well this is from
The Purpose Driven Life The Bible must become
the authoritative standard for my life the compass I rely on for direction the counsel I listen to
for making wise decisions and the benchmark I use
for evaluating everything Well maybe OK but whats going
to follow from this And heres one that does concern me Remember I quoted him
before with this line Surrendered people obey Gods word
even if it doesnt make sense And thats a problem Sighs Dont ever argue with the Devil Hes better at arguing than you are having had thousands
of years to practice Now Rick Warren
didnt invent this clever move Its an old move Its a very clever
adaptation of religions Its a wild card for disarming
any reasonable criticism You dont like my interpretation Youve got a reasonable objection to it Dont listen dont listen Thats the Devil speaking This discourages the sort
of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have Ive got one more problem
then Im through And Id really like to get
a response if Rick is able to do it In the Great Commission Jesus said Go to all people of all nations
and make them my disciples Baptize them in the name of the Father
the Son and the Holy Spirit and teach them to do
everything Ive told you The Bible says Jesus is the only one
who can save the world Weve seen many wonderful maps
of the world in the last day or so Heres one not as beautiful
as the others it simply shows
the religions of the world Heres one that shows the sort of current
breakdown of the different religions Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions when their holy books are telling them Dont listen to the other side
thats just Satan talking It seems to me that
thats a very problematic ship to get on for the future I found this sign as I was driving
to Maine recently in front of a church
Good without God becomes zero Sort of cute A very clever little meme I dont believe it and I think this idea
popular as it is  not in this guise but in general  is itself one of the main
problems that we face If you are like me you know
many wonderful committed engaged atheists agnostics who are being
very good without God And you also know many religious people
who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works So I wish we could drop this meme I wish this meme would go extinct Thanks very much for your attention ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

96,"Thank you I have to tell you
Im both challenged and excited My excitement is I get a chance
to give something back My challenge is the shortest seminar
I usually do is  hours Im not exaggerating I do weekends  I do more obviously
I also coach people  but Im into immersion
because how did you learn language Not just by learning principles you got in it and you did it
so often that it became real The bottom line of why Im here
besides being a crazy mofo is that  Im not here to motivate you
you dont need that obviously Often thats what people think I do and its the furthest thing from it What happens though is people say to me I dont need any motivation But thats not what I do Im the why guy I want to know why you do what you do What is your motive for action What is it that drives you
in your life today Not  years ago Are you running the same pattern Because I believe that the invisible force
of internal drive activated is the most important thing Im here because I believe
emotion is the force of life All of us here have great minds Most of us here have great minds right We all know how to think With our minds we can
rationalize anything We can make anything happen I agree with what was described
a few days ago that people work in their selfinterest But we know that thats bullshit at times You dont work in your
selfinterest all the time because when emotion comes into it the wiring changes
in the way it functions So its wonderful to think intellectually
about how the life of the world is especially those who are very smart
can play this game in our head But I really want to know
whats driving you What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore
where you are today for two reasons One so that you can contribute more And two that hopefully we can not just
understand other people more but appreciate them more
and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges
that we face today Theyre only going to get magnified
by the very technology that connects us because its making us intersect That intersection
doesnt always create a view of everybody now understands everybody and everybody appreciates everybody Ive had an obsession
basically for  years What makes the difference
in the quality of peoples lives What in their performance I got hired to produce the result now Ive done it for  years I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down
on national television and they were ahead by five strokes and now they cant get back on the course Ive got to do something right now
or nothing matters I get the phone call when the child
is going to commit suicide Ive got to do something In  years Im very grateful
to tell you Ive never lost one It doesnt mean I wont some day
but I havent yet The reason is an understanding
of these human needs When I get those calls
about performance thats one thing How do you make a change Im also looking to see what is shaping
the persons ability to contribute to do something beyond themselves Maybe the real question is I look at life and say
theres two master lessons One is theres the science
of achievement which almost everyone here
has mastered amazingly How do you take the invisible
and make it visible How do you make your dreams happen Your business your contribution
to society money  whatever your body your family The other lesson that is rarely
mastered is the art of fulfillment Because science is easy right We know the rules you write the code
and you get the results Once you know the game
you just up the ante dont you But when it comes
to fulfillment  thats an art The reason is its about
appreciation and contribution You can only feel so much by yourself Ive had an interesting laboratory
to try to answer the real question how somebodys life changes if you look at them like those people
that youve given everything to Like all the resources they say they need You gave not a dollar computer
but the best computer You gave them love joy
were there to comfort them Those people very often 
you know some of them  end up the rest of their life with all this love education
money and background going in and out of rehab Some people have been
through ultimate pain psychologically sexually
spiritually emotionally abused  and not always but often they become some of the people
that contribute the most to society The question weve got to ask
ourselves really is what is it What is it that shapes us We live in a therapy culture Most of us dont do that
but the cultures a therapy culture the mindset that we are our past And you wouldnt be in this room
if you bought that but most of society
thinks biography is destiny The past equals the future Of course it does if you live there But what we know and what
we have to remind ourselves  because you can know
something intellectually and then not use it not apply it Weve got to remind ourselves
that decision is the ultimate power When you ask people have you failed to achieve
something significant in your life Say Aye Audience Aye TR Thanks for the interaction
on a high level there But if you ask people
why didnt you achieve something Somebody whos working for you
or a partner or even yourself When you fail to achieve
whats the reason people say What do they tell you Didnt have the knowledge
didnt have the money didnt have the time
didnt have the technology I didnt have the right manager Al Gore Supreme Court
TR The Supreme Court Applause Cheering Applause continues TR And  What do all those including
the Supreme Court have in common They are a claim to you missing
resources and they may be accurate You may not have the money
or the Supreme Court but that is not the defining factor Applause Laughter And you correct me if Im wrong The defining factor is never resources
its resourcefulness And what I mean specifically
rather than just some phrase is if you have emotion human emotion something that I experienced from you
the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound
as Ive ever experienced and I believe with that emotion
you would have beat his ass and won Audience Yeah Applause Cheering How easy for me to tell him
what he should do Idiot Robbins But I know when we watched
the debate at that time there were emotions
that blocked peoples ability to get this mans intellect and capacity And the way that it came across
to some people on that day  because I know people that wanted
to vote in your direction and didnt and I was upset But there was emotion there Do you know what Im talking about Say Aye Audience Aye TR So emotion is it And if we get the right emotion
we can get ourselves to do anything If youre creative playful fun enough can you get through to anybody yes or no If you dont have the money but youre creative and determined
you find the way This is the ultimate resource But this is not the story
that people tell us They tell us a bunch of different stories They tell us we dont have
the resources but ultimately if you take a look here they say what are all the reasons
they havent accomplished that Hes broken my pattern
that sonofabitch But I appreciated the energy
Ill tell you that What determines your resources Weve said decisions shape destiny
which is my focus here If decisions shape destiny
what determines it is three decisions What will you focus on You have to decide
what youre going to focus on Consciously or unconsciously the minute you decide to focus
you must give it a meaning and that meaning produces emotion Is this the end or the beginning Is God punishing me or rewarding me
or is this the roll of the dice An emotion creates
what were going to do or the action So think about your own life the decisions that
have shaped your destiny And that sounds really heavy
but in the last five or  years have there been some decisions that if youd made a different decision
your life would be completely different How many can think about it
Better or worse Say Aye Audience Aye So the bottom line is
maybe it was where to go to work and you met the love of your life there
a career decision I know the Google geniuses I saw here  I mean I understand that their decision
was to sell their technology What if they made that decision
versus to build their own culture How would the world or their lives
be different their impact The history of our world
is these decisions When a woman stands up and says
No I wont go to the back of the bus She didnt just affect her life
That decision shaped our culture Or someone standing in front of a tank Or being in a position
like Lance Armstrong Youve got testicular cancer Thats pretty tough for any male
especially if you ride a bike Youve got it in your brain
youve got it in your lungs But what was his decision
of what to focus on Different than most people
What did it mean It wasnt the end it was the beginning He goes off and wins
seven championships he never once won before the cancer because he got
emotional fitness psychological strength Thats the difference
in human beings that Ive seen of the three million Ive been around In my lab Ive had three million people
from  countries over the last  years And after a while
patterns become obvious You see that South America and Africa
may be connected in a certain way right Others say Oh that sounds
ridiculous Its simple So what shaped Lance What shapes you Two invisible forces
Very quickly One state We all have had times you did something and after
you thought to yourself I cant believe I said or did that
that was so stupid Whos been there Say Aye
Audience Aye Or after you did something
you go That was me It wasnt your ability it was your state Your model of the world
is what shapes you long term Your model of the world is the filter
Thats whats shaping us It makes people make decisions To influence somebody we need to know
what already influences them Its made up of three parts First whats your target
What are you after Its not your desires You can get your desires or goals Who has ever got a goal or desire
and thought is this all there is Say Aye Audience Aye Its needs we have I believe
there are six human needs Second once you know what the target
thats driving you is and you uncover it for the truth 
you dont form it  then you find out whats your map whats the belief systems
that tell you how to get those needs Some people think the way
to get them is to destroy the world some people to build
create something love someone Theres the fuel you pick
So very quickly six needs Let me tell you what they are
First one certainty These are not goals or desires
these are universal Everyone needs certainty
they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable Now how do you get it Control everybody Develop a skill
Give up Smoke a cigarette And if you got totally
certain ironically even though we need that  youre not certain about your health
or your children or money If youre not sure
the ceiling will hold up you wont listen to any speaker While we go for certainty differently
if we get total certainty we get what What do you feel if youre certain You know what will happen
when and how it will happen what would you feel Bored out of your minds
So God in Her infinite wisdom gave us a second human need
which is uncertainty We need variety We need surprise How many of you here
love surprises Say Aye Audience Aye TR Bullshit You like
the surprises you want The ones you dont want
you call problems but you need them So variety is important Have you ever rented a video
or a film that youve already seen Whos done this Get a fucking life Why are you doing it Youre certain its good
because you read or saw it before but youre hoping its been
long enough youve forgotten and theres variety Third human need critical significance We all need to feel important
special unique You can get it by making more money
or being more spiritual You can do it by getting yourself
in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places
humans dont want to know Whatever it takes The fastest way to do this if you have no background
no culture no belief and resources or resourcefulness is violence If I put a gun to your head and I live
in the hood instantly Im significant Zero to  How high  How certain am I that
youre going to respond to me  How much uncertainty Who knows whats going to happen next
Kind of exciting Like climbing up into a cave
and doing that stuff all the way down there Total variety and uncertainty And its significant isnt it
So you want to risk your life for it So thats why violence has always
been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness
change as a species You can get significance a million ways but to be significant youve got
to be unique and different Heres what we really need
connection and love fourth need We all want it most settle for connection
loves too scary Who here has been hurt
in an intimate relationship If you dont raise your hand
youve had other shit too And youre going to get hurt again Arent you glad you came
to this positive visit Heres whats true we need it We can do it through
intimacy friendship prayer through walking in nature If nothing else works for you
dont get a cat get a dog because if you leave for two minutes
its like youve been gone six months when you come back  minutes later These first four needs
every human finds a way to meet Even if you lie to yourself
you need to have split personalities I call the first four needs
the needs of the personality The last two are the needs of the spirit And this is where fulfillment comes You wont get it from the first four Youll figure a way smoke drink
do whatever meet the first four But number five you must grow We all know the answer If you dont grow youre what If a relationship or business
is not growing if youre not growing doesnt matter how much
money or friends you have how many love you you feel like hell And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value Because the sixth need
is to contribute beyond ourselves Because we all know corny as that sounds the secret to living is giving We all know life is not about me
its about we This culture knows that
this room knows that Its exciting When you see Nicholas
talking about his  computer the most exciting thing is heres a genius
but hes got a calling now You can feel the difference in him
and its beautiful And that calling can touch other people My life was touched
because when I was  years old Thanksgiving no money no food we were not going to starve but my father was totally messed up my mom was letting him know
how bad he messed up and somebody came to the door
and delivered food My father made three decisions
I know what they were briefly His focus was This is charity What does it mean Im worthless What do I have to do
Leave my family which he did It was one of the most painful
experiences of life My three decisions
gave me a different path I set focus on Theres food
What a concept But this is what changed my life
shaped me as a human being Somebodys gift
I dont even know who it is My father always said
No one gives a shit And now somebody I dont know theyre not asking for anything
just giving us food looking out for us It made me believe this
that strangers care And that made me decide if strangers care about me and my family
I care about them Im going to do something
to make a difference So when I was 
I went out on Thanksgiving it was my target for years to have
enough money to feed two families The most fun and moving thing
I ever did in my life Next year I did four then eight I didnt tell anybody what I was doing
I wasnt doing it for brownie points But after eight
I thought I could use some help So I went out got my friends involved then I grew companies got 
and I built the foundation  years later Im proud to tell you last year we fed
 million people in  countries through our foundation All during the holidays
Thanksgiving Christmas in different countries around the world Thank you I dont tell you that to brag
but because Im proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once theyve had the chance
to experience it not talk about it So finally  Im about out of time The target that shapes you  Heres whats different about people We have the same needs But are you a certainty freak
is that what you value most or uncertainty This man couldnt be a certainty freak
if he climbed through those caves Are you driven by significance or love We all need all six but what your lead system is
tilts you in a different direction And as you move in a direction
you have a destination or destiny The second piece is the map The operating system
tells you how to get there and some peoples map is Im going to save lives
even if I die for other people and theyre a fireman and somebody else says
Im going to kill people to do it Theyre trying to meet
the same needs of significance They want to honor God
or honor their family But they have a different map And there are seven different beliefs
I cant go through them because Im done The last piece is emotion One of the parts of the map is like time Some peoples idea
of a long time is  years Somebody elses is three seconds
which is what I have And the last one Ive already mentioned
that fell to you If youve got a target and a map  I cant use Google because I love Macs and they havent made it
good for Macs yet So if you use MapQuest  how many have made
this fatal mistake of using it You use this thing
and you dont get there Imagine if your beliefs guarantee
you can never get to where you want to go The last thing is emotion Heres what Ill tell you about emotion There are  emotions that we have words for
in the English language which is just a linguistic representation
that changes by language But if your dominant emotions  If I have  people or  and I have them write down
all the emotions that they experience in an average week and I give them as long as they need and on one side
they write empowering emotions the others disempowering guess how many emotions
they experience Less than  And half of those
make them feel like shit They have six good feelings Happy happy excited oh shit frustrated frustrated
overwhelmed depressed How many of you know somebody who no matter what happens
finds a way to get pissed off Or no matter what happens
they find a way to be happy or excited How many of you know somebody like this When  happened Ill finish
with this I was in Hawaii I was with  people from  countries we were translating
four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting
for a week The night before was called
Emotional Mastery I got up had no plan
for this and I said  we had fireworks
I do crazy shit fun stuff and at the end I stopped I had this plan but I never know
what Im going to say And all of a sudden I said When do people really start to live
When they face death And I went through this whole thing about if you werent going
to get off this island if nine days from now
you were going to die who would you call
what would you say what would you do That night is when  happened One woman had come to the seminar
and when she came there her previous boyfriend had been
kidnapped and murdered Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her
and she said no He said If you go to that Hawaii thing
its over with us She said Its over When I finished that night
she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center
where he worked saying I love you I want you to know
I want to marry you It was stupid of me She was asleep because it was  am
for us when he called her back and said Honey I cant tell you
what this means I dont know how to tell you this
but you gave me the greatest gift because Im going to die And she played the recording
for us in the room She was on Larry King later And he said Youre probably wondering how on Earth this could
happen to you twice All I can say is this must be
Gods message to you From now on every day
give your all love your all Dont let anything ever stop you She finishes and a man
stands up and he says Im from Pakistan Im a Muslim Id love to hold your hand
and say Im sorry but frankly this is retribution I cant tell you the rest
because Im out of time Are you sure  seconds Laughter and applause  seconds I want to be respectful All I can tell you is I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked
in the World Trade Center because I had about  New Yorkers there More than  lost
their entire companies friends marking off their Palm Pilots One financial trader
woman made of steel bawling   friends crossing off that all died And I said What are we
going to focus on What does this mean
and what are we going to do And I got the group to focus on if you didnt lose somebody today your focus is going to be
how to serve somebody else Then one woman stood up
and was so angry screaming and yelling I found out she wasnt from New York
shes not an American doesnt know anybody here I asked Do you always get angry She said Yes Guilty people got guilty
sad people got sad I took these two men
and I did an indirect negotiation Jewish man with family
in the occupied territory someone in New York who would have died
if he was at work that day and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and I made it very clear This integration is on a film
which Id be happy to send you instead of my verbalization but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs
and models of the world but worked together to bring
for almost four years now through various mosques and synagogues the idea of how to create peace And he wrote a book called
My Jihad My Way of Peace So transformation can happen My invitation to you is explore your web the web in here  the needs the beliefs the emotions
that are controlling you for two reasons so theres more of you to give
and achieve too but I mean give because thats whats
going to fill you up And secondly so you can appreciate  not just understand
thats intellectual thats the mind but appreciate
whats driving other people Its the only way
our worlds going to change God bless you thank you
I hope this was of service ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

97,"When you have  minutes to speak two million years seems
like a really long time But evolutionarily
two million years is nothing And yet in two million years the human brain
has nearly tripled in mass going from the oneandaquarter pound
brain of our ancestor here Habilis to the almost threepound meatloaf that everybody here
has between their ears What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager
for every one of us to have one Well it turns out when
brains triple in size they dont just get three times bigger
they gain new structures And one of the main reasons our brain got
so big is because it got a new part called the frontal lobe Particularly a part called
the prefrontal cortex What does a prefrontal cortex
do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul
of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time It turns out the prefrontal
cortex does lots of things but one of the most important things
it does is an experience simulator Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they dont make
real mistakes in planes Human beings have this
marvelous adaptation that they can actually have
experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life This is a trick that none
of our ancestors could do and that no other animal
can do quite like we can Its a marvelous adaptation Its up there with opposable thumbs
and standing upright and language as one of the things that got
our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall All of you have done this Ben and Jerrys doesnt have
liverandonion ice cream and its not because they whipped
some up tried it and went Yuck Its because without
leaving your armchair you can simulate that flavor
and say yuck before you make it Lets see how your experience
simulators are working Lets just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed
with the rest of the talk Heres two different futures
that I invite you to contemplate You can try to simulate them and tell me
which one you think you might prefer One of them is winning the lottery
This is about  million dollars And the other is becoming paraplegic Just give it a moment of thought You probably dont feel
like you need a moment of thought Interestingly there are data
on these two groups of people data on how happy they are And this is exactly
what you expected isnt it But these arent the data
I made these up These are the data You failed the pop quiz and youre hardly
five minutes into the lecture Because the fact is that a year
after losing the use of their legs and a year after winning the lotto
lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives Dont feel too bad
about failing the first pop quiz because everybody fails
all of the pop quizzes all of the time The research that my laboratory
has been doing that economists and psychologists
around the country have been doing has revealed something
really quite startling to us something we call the impact bias which is the tendency
for the simulator to work badly For the simulator to make you
believe that different outcomes are more different
than in fact they really are From field studies to laboratory studies we see that winning or losing an election
gaining or losing a romantic partner getting or not getting a promotion
passing or not passing a college test on and on have far less impact
less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have This almost floors me  a recent study showing
how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened
over three months ago with only a few exceptions it has no impact whatsoever
on your happiness Why Because happiness can be synthesized Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 
I am the happiest man alive I have that in me that can convert poverty
to riches adversity to prosperity I am more invulnerable than Achilles
fortune hath not one place to hit me What kind of remarkable machinery
does this guy have in his head Well it turns out its precisely the same
remarkable machinery that all off us have Human beings have something that we might think of
as a psychological immune system A system of cognitive processes largely
nonconscious cognitive processes that help them change
their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds
in which they find themselves Like Sir Thomas you have this machine Unlike Sir Thomas
you seem not to know it We synthesize happiness but we think
happiness is a thing to be found Now you dont need me to give you too many examples of people
synthesizing happiness I suspect Though Im going to show
you some experimental evidence you dont have to look
very far for evidence I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances
of people synthesizing happiness Here are three guys
synthesizing happiness Im better off physically
financially mentally  I dont have one minutes regret
It was a glorious experience I believe it turned out for the best Who are these characters
who are so damn happy The first one is Jim Wright Some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman
of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican
named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady
book deal he had done He lost everything The most powerful Democrat
in the country lost everything He lost his money he lost his power What does he have to say
all these years later I am so much better off physically
financially mentally and in almost every other way What other way would there
be to be better off Vegetably Minerally Animally Hes pretty much covered them there Moreese Bickham is somebody
youve never heard of Moreese Bickham uttered
these words upon being released He was  years old Hed spent  years
in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didnt commit He was ultimately released for good behavior
halfway through his sentence What did he say about his experience I dont have one minutes regret
It was a glorious experience Glorious He is not saying Well there were some nice guys
They had a gym Glorious a word we usually reserve for something
like a religious experience Harry S Langerman uttered these words
and hes somebody you might have known but didnt because in 
he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned
by two brothers named McDonalds And he thought
Thats a really neat idea So he went to find them They said We can give you a franchise
on this for  bucks Harry went back to New York
asked his brother an investment banker to loan him the 
and his brothers immortal words were You idiot nobody eats hamburgers He wouldnt lend him the money and of course six months later
Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea It turns out people do eat hamburgers and Ray Kroc for a while
became the richest man in America And then finally some of you recognize
this young photo of Pete Best who was the original
drummer for the Beatles until they you know sent him
out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour Well in  when Pete Best
was interviewed  yes hes still a drummer
yes hes a studio musician  he had this to say Im happier
than I would have been with the Beatles Okay Theres something important
to be learned from these people and it is the secret of happiness Here it is finally to be revealed First accrue wealth power
and prestige then lose it Second spend as much of your life
in prison as you possibly can Third make somebody else
really really rich And finally never ever join the Beatles Yeah right Because when people synthesize happiness as these gentlemen seem to have done we all smile at them
but we kind of roll our eyes and say Yeah right you never
really wanted the job Oh yeah right You really didnt have
that much in common with her and you figured that out just
about the time she threw the engagement
ring in your face We smirk because we believe
that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality
as what we might call natural happiness What are these terms Natural happiness is what we get
when we get what we wanted and synthetic happiness is what we make
when we dont get what we wanted And in our society
we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness
is of an inferior kind Why do we have that belief Well its very simple What kind of economic engine
would keep churning if we believed
that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it With all apologies
to my friend Matthieu Ricard a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be
particularly profitable because they dont want stuff enough I want to suggest to you
that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly
what you were aiming for Im a scientist so Im going
to do this not with rhetoric but by marinating you
in a little bit of data Let me first show you an experimental
paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness
among regular old folks And this isnt mine Its a yearold paradigm
called the free choice paradigm Its very simple You bring in say six objects and you ask a subject to rank them
from the most to the least liked In this case because
this experiment uses them these are Monet prints So everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most
to the one they like the least Now we give you a choice We happen to have
some extra prints in the closet Were going to give you
one as your prize to take home We happen to have number three
and number four we tell the subject This is a bit of a difficult choice because neither one is preferred
strongly to the other but naturally people
tend to pick number three because they liked it
a little better than number four Sometime later  it could be
 minutes it could be  days  the same stimuli are put
before the subject and the subject is asked
to rerank the stimuli Tell us how much you like them now What happens Watch as happiness is synthesized This is the result that has
been replicated over and over again Youre watching happiness be synthesized Would you like to see it again Happiness The one I got is really
better than I thought That other one I didnt get sucks Thats the synthesis of happiness Now whats the right response to that Yeah right Now heres the experiment we did and I hope this is going to convince you that Yeah right
was not the right response We did this experiment
with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia These are hospitalized patients Most of them have Korsakoffs syndrome a polyneuritic psychosis They drank way too much
and they cant make new memories OK They remember their childhood
but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back
they dont know who you are We took our Monet prints to the hospital And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked
the most to the one they liked the least We then gave them the choice
between number three and number four Like everybody else they said Gee thanks Doc Thats great
I could use a new print Ill take number three We explained we would have
number three mailed to them We gathered up our materials
and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour Back into the room
we say Hi were back The patients bless them
say Ah Doc Im sorry Ive got a memory problem
thats why Im here If Ive met you before I dont remember Really you dont remember
I was just here with the Monet prints Sorry Doc I just dont have a clue No problem Jim All I want
you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most
to the one you like the least What do they do Well lets first check and make sure
theyre really amnesiac We ask these amnesiac patients
to tell us which one they own which one they chose last
time which one is theirs And what we find is amnesiac
patients just guess These are normal controls
where if I did this with you all of you would know
which print you chose But if I do this with amnesiac patients
they dont have a clue They cant pick
their print out of a lineup Heres what normal controls do
they synthesize happiness Right This is the change in liking score the change from the first time they ranked
to the second time they ranked Normal controls show 
that was the magic I showed you now Im showing it to you
in graphical form  The one I own is better than I thought The one I didnt own
the one I left behind is not as good as I thought Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing
Think about this result These people like better the one they own but they dont know they own it Yeah right is not the right response What these people did
when they synthesized happiness is they really truly changed their affective hedonic aesthetic
reactions to that poster Theyre not just saying it
because they own it because they dont know they own it When psychologists show you bars you know that they are showing
you averages of lots of people And yet all of us have this
psychological immune system this capacity to synthesize happiness but some of us do this trick
better than others And some situations allow anybody
to do it more effectively than other situations do It turns out that freedom the ability to make up your mind
and change your mind is the friend of natural happiness
because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one
that you would most enjoy But freedom to choose to change and make up your mind is the enemy of synthetic happiness And Im going to show you why
Dilbert already knows of course Dogberts tech support
How may I abuse you My printer prints a blank
page after every document Why complain about getting free paper Free Arent you just
giving me my own paper Look at the quality of the free paper
compared to your lousy regular paper Only a fool or a liar would say
that they look the same Now that you mention it
it does seem a little silkier What are you doing Im helping people accept the things
they cannot change Indeed The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck
when we are trapped This is the difference
between dating and marriage You go out on a date with a guy and he picks his nose
you dont go out on another date Youre married to a guy
and he picks his nose He has a heart of gold
Dont touch the fruitcake You find a way to be happy
with whats happened Now what I want to show you is that people dont know
this about themselves and not knowing this can work
to our supreme disadvantage Heres an experiment we did at Harvard We created a blackandwhite
photography course and we allowed students to come in
and learn how to use a darkroom So we gave them cameras
they went around campus they took  pictures
of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog and all the other things they wanted
to have Harvard memories of They bring us the camera
we make up a contact sheet they figure out which are
the two best pictures and we now spend six hours
teaching them about darkrooms And they blow two of them up and they have two gorgeous
eightby glossies of meaningful things to them and we say Which one would you like to give up I have to give one up Yes we need one as evidence
of the class project So you have to give me one
You have to make a choice You get to keep one
and I get to keep one Now there are two conditions
in this experiment In one case the students are told But you know
if you want to change your mind Ill always have the other one here and in the next four days before
I actually mail it to headquarters  Yeah headquarters  Ill be glad to swap it out with you In fact Ill come to your dorm room
just give me an email Better yet Ill check with you You ever want to change your mind
its totally returnable The other half of the students
are told exactly the opposite Make your choice and by the way the mail is going out gosh
in two minutes to England Your picture will be winging
its way over the Atlantic You will never see it again Half of the students
in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much theyre going to come
to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind Other students are just sent back
to their little dorm rooms and they are measured
over the next three to six days on their liking satisfaction
with the pictures And look at what we find First of all heres what students
think is going to happen They think theyre going to maybe
come to like the picture they chose a little more
than the one they left behind but these are not statistically
significant differences Its a very small increase
and it doesnt much matter whether they were in the reversible
or irreversible condition Wrongo Bad simulators Because
heres whats really happening Both right before the swap
and five days later people who are stuck with that picture who have no choice who can never change their mind like it a lot And people who are deliberating
 Should I return it Have I gotten the right one
Maybe this isnt the good one Maybe I left the good one 
have killed themselves They dont like their picture and in fact even after the opportunity
to swap has expired they still dont like their picture Why Because the reversible condition
is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness So heres the final piece
of this experiment We bring in a whole new group
of naive Harvard students and we say You know
were doing a photography course and we can do it one of two ways We could do it so that when
you take the two pictures youd have four days to change your mind or were doing another course
where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away
and you can never change it Which course would you like
to be in Duh  percent of the students twothirds prefer to be in the course where they have
the opportunity to change their mind Hello  percent of the students
choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply
dissatisfied with the picture Because they do not know the conditions
under which synthetic happiness grows The Bard said everything best
of course and hes making my point here but hes making it hyperbolically Tis nothing good or bad 
But thinking makes it so Its nice poetry
but that cant exactly be right Is there really nothing good or bad Is it really the case that gall bladder
surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing That seems like a onequestion IQ test They cant be exactly the same In more turgid prose
but closer to the truth was the father of modern capitalism
Adam Smith and he said this This is worth contemplating The great source of both the misery
and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating
the difference between one permanent
situation and another  Some of these situations may no doubt
deserve to be preferred to others but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor
which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice or to corrupt the future
tranquility of our minds either by shame from the remembrance
of our own folly or by remorse for the horror
of our own injustice In other words yes some things
are better than others We should have preferences that lead us
into one future over another But when those preferences
drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated
the difference between these futures we are at risk When our ambition is bounded
it leads us to work joyfully When our ambition is unbounded it leads us to lie to cheat
to steal to hurt others to sacrifice things of real value When our fears are bounded were prudent were cautious were thoughtful When our fears
are unbounded and overblown were reckless and were cowardly The lesson I want to leave
you with from these data is that our longings and our worries
are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity
to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing
when we choose experience Thank you ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

98,"My title Queerer than we can
suppose the strangeness of science Queerer than we can suppose comes
from JBS Haldane the famous biologist who said Now my own suspicion
is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose but queerer
than we can suppose I suspect that there are more things
in heaven and earth than are dreamed of or can
be dreamed of in any philosophy Richard Feynman compared
the accuracy of quantum theories  experimental predictions  to specifying the width of North America
to within one hairs breadth of accuracy This means that quantum theory
has got to be in some sense true Yet the assumptions
that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those
predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself
was moved to remark If you think you understand
quantum theory you dont understand quantum theory Its so queer that physicists
resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it David Deutsch whos talking here
in The Fabric of Reality embraces the manyworlds
interpretation of quantum theory because the worst that you
can say about it is that its preposterously wasteful It postulates a vast and rapidly growing
number of universes existing in parallel mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole
of quantum mechanical experiments And thats Richard Feynman The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example Science as opposed to technology does violence to common sense Every time you drink a glass
of water he points out the odds are that you will imbibe
at least one molecule that passed through the bladder
of Oliver Cromwell Its just elementary probability theory The number of molecules
per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls
or bladdersful in the world And of course theres nothing special
about Cromwell or bladders  you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung
of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree Queerer than we can suppose What is it that makes us
capable of supposing anything and does this tell us anything
about what we can suppose Are there things about the universe
that will be forever beyond our grasp but not beyond the grasp
of some superior intelligence Are there things about the universe that are in principle
ungraspable by any mind however superior The history of science has been
one long series of violent brainstorms as successive generations
have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness
in the universe Were now so used to the idea
that the Earth spins rather than the Sun moves across the sky its hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution
that must have been After all it seems obvious
that the Earth is large and motionless the Sun small and mobile But its worth recalling
Wittgensteins remark on the subject Tell me he asked a friend
why do people always say it was natural for man to assume
that the Sun went round the Earth rather than that the Earth was rotating And his friend replied Well obviously because it just looks as though
the Sun is going round the Earth Wittgenstein replied Well
what would it have looked like if it had looked as though
the Earth was rotating Science has taught us
against all intuition that apparently solid things
like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely
composed of empty space And the familiar illustration
is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle
of a sports stadium and the next atom
is in the next sports stadium So it would seem the hardest
solidest densest rock is really almost entirely empty space broken only by tiny particles
so widely spaced they shouldnt count Why then do rocks look and feel
solid and hard and impenetrable As an evolutionary biologist
Id say this our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders
of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at We never evolved to navigate
in the world of atoms If we had our brains
probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands precisely because
objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other Its therefore useful for our brains to construct notions
like solidity and impenetrability because such notions help us
to navigate our bodies through the middlesized world
in which we have to navigate Moving to the other end of the scale our ancestors never had to navigate
through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light If they had our brains would be
much better at understanding Einstein I want to give the name Middle World
to the mediumscaled environment in which weve evolved
the ability to take act  nothing to do with Middle Earth  Middle World We are evolved denizens of Middle World and that limits what
we are capable of imagining We find it intuitively easy
to grasp ideas like when a rabbit moves
at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other
Middle World objects move and hits another Middle World object
like a rock it knocks itself out May I introduce Major General
Albert Stubblebine III commander of military
intelligence in  He stared at his wall in Arlington
Virginia and decided to do it As frightening as the prospect was
he was going into the next office He stood up and moved
out from behind his desk What is the atom mostly made of
he thought Space He started walking What am I
mostly made of Atoms He quickened his pace
almost to a jog now What is the wall mostly made of Atoms All I have to do is merge the spaces Then General Stubblebine banged
his nose hard on the wall of his office Stubblebine who commanded
 soldiers was confounded by his continual failure
to walk through the wall He has no doubt that this ability
will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal Who would screw around with an army
that could do that Thats from an article in Playboy which I was reading the other day I have every reason to think its true I was reading Playboy because I myself
had an article in it Unaided human intuition
schooled in Middle World finds it hard to believe Galileo
when he tells us a heavy object and a light object
air friction aside would hit the ground at the same instant And thats because in Middle World
air friction is always there If wed evolved in a vacuum we would expect them to hit
the ground simultaneously If we were bacteria constantly buffeted by thermal
movements of molecules it would be different But we MiddleWorlders are too big
to notice Brownian motion In the same way our lives
are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious
to the force of surface tension A small insect would reverse
these priorities Steve Grand  hes the one on the left Douglas Adams is on the right Steve Grand in his book
Creation Life and How to Make It is positively scathing about our
preoccupation with matter itself We have this tendency to think
that only solid material things are really things at all Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation
in a vacuum seem unreal Victorians thought the waves
had to be waves in some material medium the ether But we find real matter comforting only because weve evolved
to survive in Middle World where matter is a useful fiction A whirlpool for Steve Grand
is a thing with just as much reality as a rock In a desert plain in Tanzania in the shadow of the volcano
Ol Doinyo Lengai theres a dune made of volcanic ash The beautiful thing
is that it moves bodily Its whats technically known
as a barchan and the entire dune walks
across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about  meters per year It retains its crescent shape and moves
in the direction of the horns What happens is that the wind blows
the sand up the shallow slope on the other side and then as each sand grain hits
the top of the ridge it cascades down on the inside of the crescent and so the whole hornshaped dune moves Steve Grand points out
that you and I are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing He invites us the reader to think of an experience
from your childhood something you remember clearly something you can see
feel maybe even smell as if you were really there After all you really were there
at the time werent you How else would you remember it But here is the bombshell
You werent there Not a single atom
that is in your body today was there when that event took place Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you Whatever you are therefore you are not the stuff
of which you are made If that doesnt make the hair stand up
on the back of your neck read it again until it does
because it is important So really isnt a word that we should
use with simple confidence If a neutrino had a brain which it evolved
in neutrinosized ancestors it would say that rocks really
do consist of empty space We have brains that evolved
in mediumsized ancestors which couldnt walk through rocks Really for an animal is whatever
its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival And because different species
live in different worlds there will be a discomforting
variety of reallys What we see of the real world
is not the unvarnished world but a model of the world
regulated and adjusted by sense data but constructed so its useful
for dealing with the real world The nature of the model depends
on the kind of animal we are A flying animal needs
a different kind of model from a walking climbing
or swimming animal A monkeys brain must have
software capable of simulating a threedimensional world
of branches and trunks A moles software for constructing models
of its world will be customized for underground use A water striders brain
doesnt need D software at all since it lives on the surface of the pond in an Edwin Abbott flatland Ive speculated that bats may see
color with their ears The world model that a bat needs
in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world
model that any flying bird  a dayflying bird like a swallow 
needs to perform the same kind of tasks The fact that the bat uses
echoes in pitch darkness to input the current
variables to its model while the swallow uses
light is incidental Bats Ive even suggested use
perceived hues such as red and blue as labels internal labels
for some useful aspect of echoes  perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces
furry or smooth and so on  in the same way as swallows or indeed
we use those perceived hues  redness and blueness etc  to label long and short
wavelengths of light Theres nothing inherent about red
that makes it long wavelength The point is that the nature of the model
is governed by how it is to be used rather than by the sensory
modality involved JBS Haldane himself had
something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell Dogs can distinguish two very similar
fatty acids extremely diluted caprylic acid and caproic acid The only difference you see is that one has an extra pair
of carbon atoms in the chain Haldane guesses that a dog would probably
be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular
weights by their smells just as a man could place
a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths
by means of their notes Now theres another
fatty acid capric acid which is just like the other two except that it has two more carbon atoms A dog that had never met
capric acid would perhaps have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble
imagining a trumpet say playing one note higher than weve heard
a trumpet play before Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other
smelloriented animals smell in color And the argument would be exactly
the same as for the bats Middle World  the range
of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel
intuitively comfortable with  is a bit like the narrow range
of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors Were blind to all
frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to help us Middle World is the narrow
range of reality which we judge to be normal
as opposed to the queerness of the very small the very large
and the very fast We could make a similar
scale of improbabilities nothing is totally impossible Miracles are just events
that are extremely improbable A marble statue could wave its hand at us the atoms that make up
its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway Because there are so many of them and because theres no
agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement the marble as we see it
in Middle World stays rock steady But the atoms in the hand
could all just happen to move the same way at the same time
and again and again In this case the hand would move and wed see it waving at us
in Middle World The odds against it
of course are so great that if you set out writing zeros
at the time of the origin of the universe you still would not have written
enough zeros to this day Evolution in Middle World
has not equipped us to handle very improbable events
we dont live long enough In the vastness of astronomical space
and geological time that which seems impossible
in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable One way to think about that
is by counting planets We dont know how many planets
there are in the universe but a good estimate is about  to the 
or  billion billion And that gives us a nice way to express
our estimate of lifes improbability We could make some sort of landmark points
along a spectrum of improbability which might look like the electromagnetic
spectrum we just looked at If life has arisen only once on any  life could originate once per planet
could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only
once in the entire universe in which case it would have to be here And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical things like that If life has arisen on only one planet
in the entire universe that planet has to be our planet
because here we are talking about it And that means that if we want
to avail ourselves of it were allowed to postulate chemical events
in the origin of life which have a probability as low
as one in  billion billion I dont think we shall have
to avail ourselves of that because I suspect that life
is quite common in the universe And when I say quite common
it could still be so rare that no one island of life
ever encounters another which is a sad thought How shall we interpret
queerer than we can suppose Queerer than can in principle be supposed or just queerer than we can suppose
given the limitations of our brains evolutionary
apprenticeship in Middle World Could we by training and practice emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive
as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large I genuinely dont know the answer I wonder whether we might help ourselves
to understand say quantum theory if we brought up children
to play computer games beginning in early childhood which had a makebelieve world of balls
going through two slits on a screen a world in which the strange goingson
of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computers makebelieve so that they became familiar
on the MiddleWorld scale of the stream And similarly a relativistic
computer game in which objects on the screen manifest
the Lorentz contraction and so on to try to get ourselves  to get children
into the way of thinking about it I want to end by applying
the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other Most scientists today subscribe
to a mechanistic view of the mind were the way we are because our brains
are wired up as they are our hormones are the way they are Wed be different our characters
would be different if our neuroanatomy and our
physiological chemistry were different But we scientists are inconsistent If we were consistent our response to a misbehaving
person like a childmurderer should be something like this unit has a faulty component
it needs repairing Thats not what we say What we say  and I include
the most austerely mechanistic among us which is probably me  what we say is Vile monster
prison is too good for you Or worse we seek revenge
in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating
cycle of counterrevenge which we see of course
all over the world today In short when were
thinking like academics we regard people as elaborate
and complicated machines like computers or cars But when we revert to being human we behave more like Basil Fawlty
who we remember thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldnt start on Gourmet Night The reason we personify things
like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live
in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface
tensiondominated flatland we live in a social world We swim through a sea of people  a social version of Middle World We are evolved to secondguess
the behavior of others by becoming brilliant
intuitive psychologists Treating people as machines may be scientifically
and philosophically accurate but its a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person
is going to do next The economically useful way
to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful
goalseeking agent with pleasures and pains
desires and intentions guilt blameworthiness Personification and the imputing
of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful
way to model humans its hardly surprising
the same modeling software often seizes control when were
trying to think about entities for which its not appropriate
like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people
with the universe as a whole If the universe is queerer
than we can suppose is it just because
weve been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive
in the Pleistocene of Africa Or are our brains so versatile
and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution Or finally are there some things
in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings
however godlike could dream them Thank you very much ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

102,So Im going to speak about a problem that I have and thats that Im a philosopher When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say Im a professor their eyes glaze over When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around they ask me what field Im in and I say philosophy  their eyes glaze over When I go to a philosophers party and they ask me what I work on and I say consciousness their eyes dont glaze over  their lips curl into a snarl And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think Thats impossible You cant explain consciousness The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question My late lamented friend Bob Nozick a fine philosopher in one of his books Philosophical Explanations is commenting on the ethos of philosophy  the way philosophers go about their business And he says you know Philosophers love rational argument And he says It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion and if they dont accept the conclusion they die Their heads explode The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents But in fact that doesnt change peoples minds at all Its very hard to change peoples minds about something like consciousness and I finally figured out the reason for that The reason for that is that everybodys an expert on consciousness We heard the other day that everybodys got a strong opinion about video games They all have an idea for a video game even if theyre not experts But they dont consider themselves experts on video games theyve just got strong opinions Im sure that people here who work on say climate change and global warming or on the future of the Internet encounter people who have very strong opinions about whats going to happen next But they probably dont think of these opinions as expertise Theyre just strongly held opinions But with regard to consciousness people seem to think each of us seems to think I am an expert Simply by being conscious I know all about this And so you tell them your theory and they say No no thats not the way consciousness is No youve got it all wrong And they say this with an amazing confidence And so what Im going to try to do today is to shake your confidence Because I know the feeling  I can feel it myself I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds  that you are yourselves authoritative about your own consciousness Thats the order of the day here Now this nice picture shows a thoughtballoon a thoughtbubble I think everybody understands what that means Thats supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness This is my favorite picture of consciousness thats ever been done Its a Saul Steinberg of course  it was a New Yorker cover And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque That reminds him of the word baroque barrack bark poodle Suzanne R  hes off to the races Theres a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along you learn a lot about this man What I particularly like about this picture too is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style Which reminds us as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday what we are what each of us is  what you are what I am  is approximately  trillion little cellular robots Thats what were made of No other ingredients at all Were just made of cells about  trillion of them Not a single one of those cells is conscious not a single one of those cells knows who you are or cares Somehow we have to explain how when you put together teams armies battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells  not so different really from a bacterium each one of them  the result is this I mean just look at it The content  theres color theres ideas theres memories theres history And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons How is that possible Many people just think it isnt possible at all They think No there cant be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel whos a professor of religion actually at the University of Hawaii and hes an expert magician and an expert on the street magic of India which is what this book is about Net of Magic And theres a passage in it which I would love to share with you It speaks so eloquently to the problem Im writing a book on magic I explain and Im asked Real magic By real magic people mean miracles thaumaturgical acts and supernatural powers No I answer Conjuring tricks not real magic Real magic in other words refers to the magic that is not real while the magic that is real that can actually be done is not real magic Now thats the way a lot of people feel about consciousness Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks If youre going to explain this as a bag of tricks then its not real consciousness whatever it is And as Marvin said and as other people have said Consciousness is a bag of tricks This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness So this is the problem So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you wont like for the same reason that you dont like to see a magic trick explained to you How many of you here if somebody  some smart aleck  starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done you sort of want to block your ears and say No no I dont want to know Dont take the thrill of it away Id rather be mystified Dont tell me the answer A lot of people feel that way about consciousness Ive discovered And Im sorry if I impose some clarity some understanding on you Youd better leave now if you dont want to know some of these tricks But Im not going to explain it all to you Im going to do what philosophers do Heres how a philosopher explains the sawingtheladyinhalf trick You know the sawingtheladyinhalf trick The philosopher says Im going to explain to you how thats done You see the magician doesnt really saw the lady in half He merely makes you think that he does And you say Yes and how does he do that He says Oh thats not my department Im sorry So now Im going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness But Im going to try to also show you that consciousness isnt quite as marvelous  your own consciousness isnt quite as wonderful  as you may have thought it is This is something by the way that Lee Siegel talks about in his book He marvels at how hell do a magic show and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X Y and Z He never did those things He didnt even try to do those things Peoples memories inflate what they think they saw And the same is true of consciousness Now lets see if this will work All right Lets just watch this Watch it carefully Im working with a young computeranimator documentarian named Nick Deamer and this is a little demo that hes done for me part of a larger project some of you may be interested in Were looking for a backer Its a featurelength documentary on consciousness OK now you all saw what changed right How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color Every one Ill just show you by running it again Even when you know that theyre all going to change color its very hard to notice You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all Now this is an example  one of many  of a phenomenon thats now being studied quite a bit Its one that I predicted in the last page or two of my  book Consciousness Explained where I said if you did experiments of this sort youd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes If theres time at the end Ill show you the much more dramatic case Now how can it be that there are all those changes going on and that were not aware of them Well earlier today Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades the way your eye moves around three or four times a second He didnt mention the speed Your eye is constantly in motion moving around looking at eyes noses elbows looking at interesting things in the world And where your eye isnt looking youre remarkably impoverished in your vision Thats because the foveal part of your eye which is the highresolution part is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length Thats the detail part It doesnt seem that way does it It doesnt seem that way but thats the way it is Youre getting in a lot less information than you think Heres a completely different effect This is a painting by Bellotto Its in the museum in North Carolina Bellotto was a student of Canalettos And I love paintings like that  the painting is actually about as big as it is right here And I love Canalettos because Canaletto has this fantastic detail and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting And I started across the hall in North Carolina because I thought it was probably a Canaletto and would have all that in detail And I noticed that on the bridge there theres a lot of people  you can just barely see them walking across the bridge And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people see their clothes and so forth And as I got closer and closer I actually screamed I yelled out because when I got closer I found the detail wasnt there at all There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint And as I walked towards the picture I was expecting detail that wasnt there The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things and my brain had taken the suggestion Youre familiar with a more recent technology which is  There you can get a better view of the blobs See when you get close theyre really just blobs of paint You will have seen something like this  this is the reverse effect Ill just give that to you one more time Now what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion When an artful blob of paint or two by an artist suggests a person  say one of Marvin Minskys little society of mind  do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere I dont think so Not a chance But then how on Earth is it done Well remember the philosophers explanation of the lady Its the same thing The brain just makes you think that its got the detail there You think the details there but it isnt there The brain isnt actually putting the detail in your head at all Its just making you expect the detail Lets just do this experiment very quickly Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right rotated Yes How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your minds eye to see if it matched up with the one on the right How many of you rotated the one on the right OK How do you know thats what you did Theres in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over  years in cognitive science  various experiments started by Roger Shepherd who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images Yes its possible to do that But the details of the process are still in significant controversy And if you read that literature one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when youre the subject in the experiment you dont know You dont know how you do it You just know that you have certain beliefs And they come in a certain order at a certain time And what explains the fact that thats what you think Well thats where you have to go backstage and ask the magician This is a figure that I love Bradley Petrie and Dumais You may think that Ive cheated that Ive put a little whiterthanwhite boundary there How many of you see that sort of boundary with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles Can you see it Well you know in effect the boundarys really there in a certain sense Your brain is actually computing that boundary the boundary that goes right there But now notice there are two ways of seeing the cube right Its a Necker cube Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube OK Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube Because theres another way of seeing it If youre seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles some black circles theres another way of seeing it As a cube on a black background as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese Can you get it How many of you cant get it Thatll help Now you can get it These are two very different phenomena When you see the cube one way behind the screen those boundaries go away But theres still a sort of filling in as we can tell if we look at this We dont have any trouble seeing the cube but where does the color change Does your brain have to send little painters in there The purplepainters and the greenpainters fight over whos going to paint that bit behind the curtain No Your brain just lets it go The brain doesnt need to fill that in When I first started talking about the Bradley Petrie Dumais example that you just saw  Ill go back to it this one  I said that there was no fillingin behind there And I supposed that that was just a flat truth always true But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isnt Now if you think you see some pale yellow  Ill run this a few more times Look in the gray areas and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there  yeah its amazing Theres nothing there Its no trick Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes slide This is Ron Rensinks work which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book Let me just pause this for a second if I can This is changeblindness What youre going to see is two pictures one of which is slightly different from the other You see here the red roof and the gray roof and in between them there will be a mask which is just a blank screen for about a quarter of a second So youll see the first picture then a mask then the second picture then a mask And this will just continue and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change So show the original picture for  milliseconds Blank Show the next picture for  milliseconds Blank And keep going until the subject presses the button saying I see the change So now were going to be subjects in the experiment Were going to start easy Some examples No trouble there Can everybody see All right Indeed Rensinks subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button Can you see that one  seconds How many dont see it still Whats on the roof of that barn Its easy Is it a bridge or a dock There are a few more really dramatic ones and then Ill close I want you to see a few that are particularly striking This one because its so large and yet its pretty hard to see Can you see it Audience Yes Dan Dennett See the shadows going back and forth Pretty big So  seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there I love this one Ill end with this one just because its such an obvious and important thing How many still dont see it How many still dont see it How many engines on the wing of that Boeing Right in the middle of the picture Thanks very much for your attention What I wanted to show you is that scientists using their fromtheoutside thirdperson methods can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of and that in fact youre not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are And were really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind Jeff Hawkins this morning was describing his attempt to get theory and a good big theory into the neuroscience And hes right This is a problem Harvard Medical School once  I was at a talk  director of the lab said In our lab we have a saying If you work on one neuron thats neuroscience If you work on two neurons thats psychology We have to have more theory and it can come as much from the top down Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

103,"Im not quite sure whether
I really want to see a snare drum at nine oclock or so in the morning But anyway its just great
to see such a full theater and really I must thank
Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation One of the interesting things of course is the combination of that raw hand
on the instrument and technology and what he said about listening
to our young people Of course my job is all about listening And my aim really
is to teach the world to listen Thats my only real aim in life And it sounds quite simple
but actually its quite a big big job Because you know when you look
at a piece of music for example if I just open my little motorbike bag  we have here hopefully a piece of music that is full
of little black dots on the page And you know we open it up  And I read the music So technically I can actually read this I will follow the instructions
the tempo markings the dynamics I will do exactly as Im told And so therefore because time is short if I just played you literally
the first maybe two lines or so  Its very straightforward theres nothing
too difficult about the piece But here Im being told
that the piece of music is very quick Im being told where to play on the drum Im being told which part
of the stick to use And Im being told the dynamic And Im also being told
that the drum is without snares Snares on snares off So therefore if I translate
this piece of music we have this idea Drum sounds Drum sounds end And so on My career would probably last
about five years However what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music everything that there isnt time
to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher But its the things you notice when
youre not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting
and that you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface of a drum So there we experience the translation Now well experience the interpretation Drum sounds Drum sounds end Now my career may last a little longer But in a way you know
its the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady
with a pink top on I see that youre clutching
a teddy bear etc etc So I get a basic idea
as to what you might be about what you might like what you might do
as a profession etc etc However thats just the initial idea
I may have that we all get when we actually look
and we try to interpret But actually its so unbelievably shallow In the same way I look
at the music I get a basic idea I wonder what technically might be hard
or you know what I want to do Just the basic feeling However that is simply not enough And I think what Herbie said
please listen listen We have to listen
to ourselves first of all If I play for example
holding the stick  where literally I do not let go
of the stick  Drum sound youll experience quite a lot
of shock coming up through the arm And you feel really quite 
believe it or not  detached from the instrument
and from the stick even though Im actually holding
the stick quite tightly Drum sound By holding it tightly
I feel strangely more detached If I just simply let go and allow my hand my arm
to be more of a support system suddenly  Drum sound I have more dynamic with less effort Much more  Drum sound and I just feel at last
one with the stick and one with the drum And Im doing far far less So in the same way that I need
time with this instrument I need time with people
in order to interpret them Not just translate them
but interpret them If for example I play just
a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself
as a technician  that is someone who is basically
a percussion player  Marimba sounds Marimba sounds end And so on if I think of myself
as a musician  Marimba sounds Marimba sounds end And so on There is a little bit of a difference
there that is worth just  thinking about And I remember when I was  years old and I started playing timpani
and percussion and my teacher said Well how are we going to do this
You know music is about listening And I said Yes I agree with that
so whats the problem And he said Well
how are you going to hear this How are you going to hear that And I said Well how do you hear it He said Well I think
I hear it through here And I said Well I think I do too
but I also hear it through my hands through my arms cheekbones my scalp my tummy my chest my legs and so on And so we began our lessons
every single time tuning drums in particular
the kettle drums or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval
so something like  Marimba sounds that of a difference Then gradually Marimba sounds And gradually Marimba sounds And its amazing that when you do
open your body up and open your hand up to allow
the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference  Marimba sounds can be felt with just the tiniest
part of your finger there And so what we would do
is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room and together we would listen
to the sounds of the instruments and really try to connect
with those sounds far far more broadly
than simply depending on the ear Because of course the ear
is subject to all sorts of things The room we happen to be in
the amplification the quality of the instrument
the type of sticks  Marimba sounds Marimba sounds end Etc etc theyre all different Marimba sounds Marimba sounds end Same amount of weight
but different sound colors And thats basically what we are
were just human beings but we all have our own
little sound colors as it were that make up these extraordinary
personalities and characters and interests and things And as I grew older I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London and they said Well no we wont
accept you because we havent a clue you know of the future
of a socalled deaf musician And I just couldnt quite accept that And so therefore I said to them
Well look if you refuse  if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love
the art of creating sound  then we have to think very very hard
about the people you do actually accept And as a result
once we got over a little hurdle and having to audition twice they accepted me And not only that what had happened was that it changed
the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone
had no arms no legs  they could still perhaps play a wind
instrument if it was supported on a stand No circumstances at all
were used to refuse any entry And every single entry
had to be listened to experienced and then based on the musical ability then that person
could either enter or not And so therefore this in turn meant that there was an extremely
interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various
music institutions and I have to say many of them now
in the professional orchestras throughout the world The interesting thing
about this as well though  is quite simply that not only were people
connected with sound  which is basically all of us  we well know that music
really is our daily medicine I say music but actually
I mean sound Because some of the extraordinary
things Ive experienced as a musician  when you may have a yearold lad who has got the most
incredible challenges who may not be able
to control his movements who may be deaf
who may be blind etc etc  suddenly if that young lad
sits close to this instrument and perhaps even lies
underneath the marimba and you play something
thats so incredibly organlike almost  I dont really have
the right sticks perhaps  but something like this 
let me change  Soft marimba sounds Soft marimba sounds end Something thats so unbelievably simple  but he would be experiencing
something that I wouldnt be because Im on top of the sound I have the sound coming this way He would have the sound
coming through the resonators If there were no resonators
on here we would have Marimba sounds So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows
wouldnt experience those of you in the back few rows
wouldnt experience either Every single one of us
depending on where were sitting will experience this sound
quite quite differently And of course being
the participator of the sound and that is starting from the idea
of what type of sound I want to produce
for example this sound No sound Can you hear anything Exactly  because
Im not even touching it But yet we get the sensation
of something happening In the same way
that when I see a tree moves then I imagine that tree
making a rustling sound Do you see what I mean Whatever the eye sees
then theres always sound happening So theres always always that huge  I mean just this kaleidoscope
of things to draw from So all of my performances
are based on entirely what I experience and not by learning a piece of music putting on someone elses
interpretation of it buying all the CDs possible
of that particular piece of music and so on and so forth because that isnt giving me enough
of something that is so raw and so basic and something that I can fully
experience the journey of So it may be that in certain halls this dynamic may well work Soft marimba sounds Soft marimba sounds end It may be that in other halls theyre simply not going
to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft
gentle playing may have to be  Marimba sounds Marimba sounds end Do you see what I mean So because of this explosion
in access to sound especially through the Deaf community this has not only affected
how music institutions how schools for the deaf treat sound
and not just as a means of therapy  although of course
being a participator of music that definitely is the case as well  but its meant that acousticians
have had to really think about the types of halls
they put together There are so few halls in this world that actually have
very good acoustics dare I say But by that I mean where you can
absolutely do anything you imagine The tiniest softest softest sound
to something that is so broad so huge so incredible Theres always something it may sound good up there
may not be so good there it may be great there
but terrible up there maybe terrible over there
but not too bad there etc etc So to find an actual hall is incredible  for which you can play
exactly what you imagine without it being cosmetically enhanced So therefore acousticians
are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired and who are participators of sound And this is quite interesting I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening
with those halls but its just the fact
that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years weve been saying Well how on earth can they experience
music Theyre deaf We go like that and we imagine
thats what deafness is about Or we go like that and we imagine
thats what blindness is about If we see someone in a wheelchair
we assume they cannot walk It may be that they can walk
three four five steps That to them means they can walk In a years time
it could be two extra steps In another years time three extra steps Those are hugely important
aspects to think about So when we do listen to each other its unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills to really use our bodies
as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment For me as a musician who deals
with  percent of new music its very easy for me to say Oh yes I like that piece
No I dont like that piece and so on And I just find that I have to give
those pieces of music real time It may be that the chemistry
isnt quite right between myself and that particular piece of music but that doesnt mean I have the right
to say its a bad piece of music And you know one of the great things
about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid So there are no rules no right
no wrong this way that way If I asked you to clap 
maybe I can do this If I can just say Please clap
and create the sound of thunder Im assuming weve all
experienced thunder Now I dont mean just the sound I mean really listen
to that thunder within yourselves And please try to create that
through your clapping Try just  please try Loud clapping sounds Clapping ends Snow Snow Soft clapping sounds Have you ever heard snow Audience No Evelyn Glennie Well then stop clapping Try again Try again snow No sound See youre awake Rain Light clapping sounds EG Laughs Not bad Not bad The interesting thing here though
is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question Now  great imagination
thank you very much However not one of you got out
of your seats to think Right How can I clap OK maybe Clapping sounds Maybe I can use my jewelry
to create extra sounds Maybe I can use the other parts
of my body to create extra sounds Not a single one of you thought
about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats
there and using two hands In the same way when we listen to music we assume that its all being
fed through here This is how we experience music Of course its not We experience thunder thunder thunder Think think think Listen listen listen Now what can we do with thunder I remember my teacher when I first
started my very first lesson I was all prepared
with sticks ready to go And instead of him saying
OK Evelyn please feet slightly apart arms at a more or less degree angle
sticks in a more or less V shape keep this amount of space here etc Please keep your back straight
etc etc etc  where I was just probably going to end up
absolutely rigid frozen and I would not be able to strike the drum because I was thinking
of so many other things he said Evelyn take this drum
away for seven days and Ill see you next week So  heavens What was I to do I no longer required the sticks I wasnt allowed to have these sticks I had to basically look
at this particular drum see how it was made what these little lugs did
what the snares did Turned it upside down
experimented with the shell Drum sounds Experimented with the head Drum sounds Experimented with my body Drum sounds Experimented with jewelry Experimented with all sorts of things Drum sounds Drum sounds end And of course I returned
with all sorts of bruises But nevertheless it was such
an unbelievable experience because where on earth are you going
to experience that in a piece of music Where on earth are you going
to experience that in a study book So we never ever dealt
with actual study books So for example
one of the things that we learn when we are dealing
with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician is basically straightforward
singlestroke rolls Drum sounds Like that and then
we get a little faster  Drum sounds and a little faster  Drum sounds and a little faster
and so on and so forth What does this piece require Singlestroke rolls Drum sound So why cant I then do that
whilst learning a piece of music And thats exactly what he did And interestingly the older I became
and when I became a fulltime student at a socalled music institution
all of that went out of the window We had to study from study books And constantly the question Well why
Why What is this relating to I need to play a piece of music Well this will help your control Well how Why do I need to learn that I need to relate it to a piece of music You know I need to say something Why am I practicing paradiddles Drum sounds Is it just literally for control
for handstick control Why am I doing that I need to have the reason and the reason has to be by saying
something through the music And by saying something through music
which basically is sound we then can reach all sorts
of things to all sorts of people But I dont want to take responsibility
of your emotional baggage Thats up to you
when you walk through a hall because that then determines
what and how we listen to certain things I may feel sorrowful or happy
or exhilarated or angry when I play certain pieces of music but Im not necessarily wanting you
to feel exactly the same thing So please the next time
you go to a concert just allow your body to open up allow your body to be
this resonating chamber Be aware that youre not going
to experience the same thing as the performer is The performer is in the worst possible
position for the actual sound because theyre hearing
the contact of the stick  Drum sound on the drum or the mallet
on the bit of wood or the bow on the string etc or the breath thats creating
the sound from wind and brass Theyre experiencing that rawness there But yet theyre experiencing
something so unbelievably pure which is before the sound
is actually happening Please take note of the life of the sound
after the actual initial strike or breath is being pulled Just experience the whole
journey of that sound in the same way that I wished
Id experienced the whole journey of this particular conference
rather than just arriving last night But I hope maybe we can share
one or two things as the day progresses But thank you very much for having me Applause ends Music Music ends ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

104,In  with Rachel Carsons Silent Spring I think for people like me in the world of the making of things the canary in the mine wasnt singing And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared And the question was were the birds singing Now Im not a scientist thatll be really clear But you know weve just come from this discussion of what a bird might be What is a bird Well in my world this is a rubber duck It comes in California with a warning  This product contains chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm This is a bird What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children I think we have a design problem Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called The Monticello Dialogues on NPR and sent me this as a thank you note  We realize that design is a signal of intention but it also has to occur within a world and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design we in a way need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet and I think the exciting part of that is the good news thats there because the news is the news of abundance and not the news of limits and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent driven by the sun and start to imagine what that would be like to share That was a nice thing to get That was one sentence Henry James would be proud This is  I put it down at the bottom but that was extemporaneous obviously The fundamental issue is that for me design is the first signal of human intentions So what are our intentions and what would our intentions be  if we wake up in the morning we have designs on the world  well what would our intention be as a species now that were the dominant species And its not just stewardship and dominion debate because really dominion is implicit in stewardship  because how could you dominate something you had killed And stewardships implicit in dominion because you cant be steward of something if you cant dominate it So the question is what is the first question for designers Now as guardians  lets say the state for example which reserves the right to kill the right to be duplicitous and so on  the question were asking the guardian at this point is are we meant how are we meant to secure local societies create world peace and save the environment But I dont know that thats the common debate Commerce on the other hand is relatively quick essentially creative highly effective and efficient and fundamentally honest because we cant exchange value for very long if we dont trust each other So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work but the question we bring to it is how do we love all the children of all species for all time And so we start our designs with that question Because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy If we come here and say Well I didnt intend to cause global warming on the way here and we say Thats not part of my plan then we realize its part of our de facto plan Because its the thing thats happening because we have no other plan And I was at the White House for President Bush meeting with every federal department and agency and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan If the end game is global warming theyre doing great If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as Brain death for all children No child left behind So the question is how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families So if you dont have an endgame of something delightful then youre just moving chess pieces around if you dont know youre taking the king So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change which requires humility And in my business as an architect its unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since The Fountainhead So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility reflect on this  it took us  years to put wheels on our luggage So as Kevin Kelly pointed out there is no endgame There is an infinite game and were playing in that infinite game And so we call it cradle to cradle and our goal is very simple This is what I presented to the White House Our goal is a delightfully diverse safe healthy and just world with clean air clean water soil and power  economically equitably ecologically and elegantly enjoyed period What dont you like about this Which part of this dont you like So we realized we want full diversity even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France He said What do you think its like trying to run a country with  kinds of cheese But at the same time we realize that our products are not safe and healthy So weve designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimers later in life We can ask ourselves what is justice and is justice blind or is justice blindness And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes Is there anybody here who doesnt breathe Clean soil is a critical problem  the nitrification the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico A fundamental issue thats not being addressed Weve seen the first form of solar energy thats beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains and so that hegemony is leaving And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC they asked him When will we see the end of the age of oil I dont know if you remember his answer but it was The Stone Age didnt end because we ran out of stones We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that dont We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles sent to China This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens environment which is from copper On the other hand we see great signs of hope Heres Dr Venkataswamy in India whos figured out how to do massproduced health He has given eyesight to two million people for free We see in our material flows that car steels dont become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings  bismuth antimony copper and so on They become building steel On the other hand were working with Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet the largest carpet company in the world Weve developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable down to the parts per million The upper is Nylon  that can go back to caprolactam the bottom a polyolephine  infinitely recyclable thermoplastic Now if I was a bird the building on my left is a liability The building on my right which is our corporate campus for The Gap with an ancient meadow is an asset  its nesting grounds Heres where I come from I grew up in Hong Kong with six million people in  square miles During the dry season we had four hours of water every fourth day And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for  centuries You cant farm the same piece of ground for  centuries without understanding nutrient flow My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington among the first growth and big growth My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off I went to Yale for graduate school studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier affectionately known in our business as Brutalism If we look at the world of architecture we see with Mies  tower for Berlin the question might be Well wheres the sun And this might have worked in Berlin but we built it in Houston and the windows are all closed And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use this is actually a vertical gas chamber When I went to Yale we had the first energy crisis and I was designing the first solarheated house in Ireland as a student which I then built  which would give you a sense of my ambition And Richard Meier who was one of my teachers kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism and he would say Bill youve got to understand  solar energy has nothing to do with architecture I guess he didnt read Vitruvius In  we did the first socalled green office in America for Environmental Defense We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials They said Theyre proprietary theyre legal go away The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace So all of a sudden here I am graduating from high school in  and this happens and we realize that away went away Remember we used to throw things away and wed point to away And yet NOAA has now shown us for example  you see that little blue thing above Hawaii Thats the Pacific Gyre It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists and they found six times as much plastic as plankton When asked they said Its kind of like a giant toilet that doesnt flush Perhaps thats away So were looking for the design rules of this  this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world Irian Jaya  species of tree and we described this in the book Cradle to Cradle The book itself is a polymer It is not a tree Thats the name of the first chapter  This Book is Not a Tree Because in poetics as Margaret Atwood pointed out we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears And with so much polymer what we really need is technical nutrition and to use something as elegant as a tree  imagine this design assignment Design something that makes oxygen sequesters carbon fixes nitrogen distills water accrues solar energy as fuel makes complex sugars and food creates microclimates changes colors with the seasons and selfreplicates Well why dont we knock that down and write on it So were looking at the same criteria as most people  you know can I afford it Does it work Do I like it Were adding the Jeffersonian agenda and I come from Charlottesville where Ive had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson Were adding life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Now if we look at the word competition Im sure most of youve used it You know most people dont realize it comes from the Latin competere which means strive together It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other They get fit together and then they compete The Williams sisters compete  one wins Wimbledon So weve been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together And the Chinese government has now  I work with the Chinese government now  has taken this up Were also looking at survival of the fittest not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good Now most environmentalists dont say growth is good because in our lexicon asphalt is two words assigning blame But if we look at asphalt as our growth then we realize that all were doing is destroying the planetarys fundamental underlying operating system So when we see E equals mc squared come along from a poets perspective we see energy as physics chemistry as mass and all of a sudden you get this biology And we have plenty of energy so well solve that problem but the biology problems tricky because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge we will never be able to recover that And as Francis Crick pointed out nine years after discovering DNA with Mr Watson that life itself has to have growth as a precondition  it has to have free energy sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals So were asking for human artifice to become a living thing and we want growth we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals Then the question becomes not growth or no growth but what do you want to grow So instead of just growing destruction we want to grow the things that we might enjoy and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese So therefore we have these two metabolisms and I worked with a German chemist Michael Braungart and weve identified the two fundamental metabolisms The biological one Im sure you understand but also the technical one where we take materials and put them into closed cycles We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition Biological nutrition can supply about  million humans which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton the world would run out of cork and dry up So we need materials in closed cycles but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer birth defects mutagenic effects disruption of our immune systems biodegradation persistence heavy metal content knowledge of how were making them and their production and so on Our first product was a textile where we analyzed  chemicals in the textile industry Using those intellectual filters we eliminated  We were left with  chemicals We have since databased the  most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing and were releasing this database into the public in six weeks So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health Weve developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains because when we asked most companies we work with  about a trillion dollars  and say Where does your stuff come from They say Suppliers And where does it go Customers So we need some help there So the biological nutrients the first fabrics  the water coming out was clean enough to drink Technical nutrients  this is for Shaw Carpet infinitely reusable carpet Heres nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet Biotechnical nutrients  the Model U for Ford Motor a cradle to cradle car  concept car Shoes for Nike where the uppers are polyesters infinitely recyclable the bottoms are biodegradable soles Wear your old shoes in your new shoes out There is no finish line The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever some of the materials go back to soil  its all solarpowered Heres a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water Heres a building for The Gap where the ancient grasses of San Bruno California are on the roof And this is our project for Ford Motor Company Its the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn This is obviously a color photograph These are our tools These are how we sold it to Ford We saved Ford  million dollars doing it this way day one which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for  million dollars worth of cars Here it is Its the worlds largest green roof  and a half acres This is the roof saving money and this is the first species to arrive here These are killdeer They showed up in five days And we now have pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet Were developing now protocols for cities  thats the home of technical nutrients The country  the home of biological And putting them together And so I will finish by showing you a new city were designing for the Chinese government Were doing  cities for China right now based on cradle to cradle as templates Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for  million people in  years We did a mass energy balance  if they use brick they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal Theyll have cities with no energy and no food We signed a Memorandum of Understanding  heres Madam Deng Nan Deng Xiaopings daughter  for China to adopt cradle to cradle Because if they toxify themselves being the lowestcost producer send it to the lowestcost distribution  WalMart  and then we send them all our money what well discover is that we have what effectively when I was a student was called mutually assured destruction Now we do it by molecule These are our cities Were building a new city next to this city look at that landscape This is the site We dont normally do green fields but this one is about to be built so they brought us in to intercede This is their plan Its a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape And they brought us in and said What would you do This is what they would end up with which is another color photograph So this is the existing site so this is what it looks like now and heres our proposal So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully We studied the biota the ancient biota the current farming and the protocols We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure We lay out the building areas We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be The transportation is all very simple everybodys within a fiveminute walk of mobility We have a hour street so that theres always a place thats alive The waste systems all connect If you flush a toilet your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants which are sold as assets not liabilities Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations And then it makes natural gas which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city So this is  these are fertilizer gas plants And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city where weve got farming because what weve done is lifted up the city the landscape into the air to  to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings The solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city And this is the concept for the top of the city Weve lifted the earth up onto the roofs The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next We inhabit the city with worklive space on all the ground floors And so this is the existing city and this is the new city ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

105,When you think about resilience and technology its actually much easier Youre going to see some other speakers today I already know who are going to talk about breakingbones stuff and of course with technology it never is So its very easy comparatively speaking to be resilient I think that if we look at what happened on the Internet with such an incredible last half a dozen years that its hard to even get the right analogy for it A lot of how we decide how were supposed to react to things and what were supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them And so I think the tempting analogy for the boombust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush Its easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick For one thing both were very real In  in that Gold Rush they took over  million worth of gold out of California It was very real The Internet was also very real This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other Its a big deal Huge boom Huge boom Huge bust Huge bust You keep going and both things are lots of hype I dont have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the Internet  like GetRichcom But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush Gold Gold Gold Sixtyeight rich men on the Steamer Portland Stacks of yellow metal Some have  Many have more A few bring out  dollars each People would get very excited about this when they read these articles The Eldorado of the United States of America the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly So many people left what they were doing And what would happen is  and the Gold Rush went on for years People on the East Coast in  when they first started to get the news they thought Ah this isnt real But they keep hearing about people getting rich and then in  they still hear that And they think its not real By about  theyre thinking Am I the stupidest person on Earth by not rushing to California And they start to decide they are These are community affairs by the way Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of   people would caravan across the United States and they would form companies These were typically not solitary efforts But no matter what if you were a lawyer or a banker people dropped what they were doing no matter what skill set they had to go pan for gold This guy on the left Dr Richard Beverley Cole he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route They would take a ship down to Panama across the isthmus and then take another ship north This guy Dr Toland went by covered wagon to California This has its parallels too Doctors leaving their practices These are both very successful  a physician in one case a surgeon in the other Same thing happened on the Internet You get DrKoopcom In the Gold Rush people literally jumped ship The San Francisco harbor was clogged with  ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold So there were literally  captains and  ships They turned the ships into hotels because they couldnt sail them anywhere You had dotcom fever And you had gold fever And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened The fort in San Francisco at the time had about  soldiers Half of them deserted to go look for gold And they wouldnt let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldnt come back And one of the soldiers wrote home and this is the sentence that he put The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and  dollars a day is a rather severe one They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush A very bad burn rate This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush This is the White Pass Trail They loaded up their mules and their horses And they didnt plan right And they didnt know how far they would really have to go and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going It got renamed the Dead Horse Trail And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way sometimes in bunches under the cliffs with pack saddles and packs where theyve fallen from the rock above sometimes in tangled masses filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march often I regret to say exhausted but still alive a fact we were unaware of until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone cannot be imagined They certainly cannot be described And you know without the smell that would have accompanied that we had the same thing on the Internet very bad burn rate calculations Ill just play one of these and youll remember it This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year  Video Bride  You said you had a large selection of invitations Clerk But we do Bride  Then why does she have my invitation Announcer What may be a little thing to some  Bride  You are mine little man Announcer Could be a really big deal to you Husband  Is that your wife Husband  Not for another  minutes Announcer After all its your special day OurBeginningcom Lifes an event Announce it to the world Jeff Bezos Its very difficult to figure out what that ad is for But they spent three and a half million dollars in the  Super Bowl to air that ad even though at the time they only had a million dollars in annual revenue Now heres where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge and I think rather severely And that is in a gold rush when its over its over Heres this guy There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed Theyve come thousands of miles on a perilous trip risked life health and property spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them And that was of course the very common story Because when you take out that last piece of gold  and they did incredibly quickly I mean if you look at the  Gold Rush  the entire American river region within two years  every stone had been turned And after that only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there So theres a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry With the electric industry you actually have to  one of them is that theyre both sort of thin horizontal enabling layers that go across lots of different industries Its not a specific thing But electricity is also very very broad so you have to sort of narrow it down You know it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power Its an incredible means of coordinating in a very finegrained way information flows Theres a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb So the light bulb is what wired the world And they werent thinking about appliances when they wired the world They were really thinking about  they werent putting electricity into the home they were putting lighting into the home And but it really  it got the electricity It took a long time This was a huge  as you would expect  a huge capital build out All the streets had to be torn up This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations And theyre tearing up all the streets The Edison Electric Company which became Edison General Electric which became General Electric paid for all of this digging up of the streets It was incredibly expensive But that is not the  and thats not the part thats really most similar to the Web Because remember the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the longdistance phone network So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure  Im going back now to sort of the explosive part of the Web in  when it was growing  percent a year How could it grow at  percent a year in  when people werent really investing in the Web Well it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure and then home appliances started coming into being And this was huge The first one was the electric fan  this was the  electric fan And the appliances the golden age of appliances really lasted  it depends how you want to measure it  but its anywhere from  to  years It goes on a long time It starts about  And the electric fan was a big success The electric iron also very big By the way this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit Theres asbestos under that handle there This is the first vacuum cleaner the  Skinner Vacuum from the Hoover Company And this one weighed  pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car So it wasnt a big seller This was truly truly an earlyadopter product  the  Skinner Vacuum But three years later by  it weighed  pounds Now not all these things were highly successful This is the electric tie press which never really did catch on People I guess decided that they would not wrinkle their ties These never really caught on either the electric shoe warmer and drier Never a big seller This came in like six different colors I dont know why But I thought you know sometimes its just not the right time for an invention maybe its time to give this one another shot So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this Wed need the right partner And I thought that really  I thought that would really work to give that another shot Now the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires and it took a lot of time and attention I want to point out one thing This is  you guys know what this is They hadnt invented the electric socket yet So this was  remember they didnt wire the houses for electricity They wired them for lighting So your  your appliances would plug in They would  each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top And youd plug it in there In fact if youve seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World youve seen this Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture All the appliances plug in there And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance The next thing that really was a big big deal was the washing machine Now this was an object of much envy and lust Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines On the lefthand side this was the soapy water And theres a rotor there  that this motor is spinning And it would clean your clothes This is the clean rinsewater So youd take the clothes out of here put them in here and then youd run the clothes through this electric wringer And this was a big deal Youd keep this on your porch It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain And youd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket And thats actually kind of an important point in my presentation because they hadnt invented the off switch That was to come much later  the off switch on appliances  because it didnt make any sense I mean you didnt want this thing clogging up a light socket So you know when you were done with it you unscrewed it Thats what you did You didnt turn it off And as I said before they hadnt invented the electric outlet either so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device And there are  when you research this there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices And they couldnt yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house And there was no off switch so it wasnt very good And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this But you know before I get too far into condemning our ancestors I thought Id show you this is my conference room This is a total kludge if you ask me First of all this got installed upside down This light socket  and so the cord keeps falling out so I taped it in This is supposed  dont even get me started But thats not the worst one This is what it looks like under my desk I took this picture just two days ago So we really havent progressed that much since  Its a total total mess And you know we think its getting better but have you tried to install  yourself I challenge you to try Its very hard I know PhDs in Computer Science  this process has brought them to tears absolute tears Laughter And thats assuming you already have DSL in your house Try to get DSL installed in your house The engineers who do it everyday cant do it They have to  typically they come three times And one friend of mine was telling me a story not only did they get there and have to wait but then the engineers when they finally did get there for the third time they had to call somebody And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there So were not  were pretty kludgey ourselves By the way DSL is a kludge I mean this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose its being put to  you know its the whole thing  were very very primitive And thats kind of the point Because you know resilience  if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush then youd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone But the good thing is with innovation there isnt a last nugget Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities And if you believe that then you believe that where we are  this is what I think  I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge  and I havent even talked about user interfaces on the Web  but theres so much kludge so much terrible stuff  we are at the  Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet Thats where we are We dont get our hair caught in it but thats the level of primitiveness of where we are Were in  And if you believe that then stuff like this doesnt bother you This is  All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble  Amazontoast In  Amazonbomb My mom hates this picture She  but you know if you really do believe that its the very very beginning if you believe its the  Hurley washing machine then youre incredibly optimistic And I do think that thats where we are And I do think theres more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us And in  Sears  I want to get this exactly right This was the advertisement that they ran in  It says Use your electricity for more than light And I think thats where we are Were very very early Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

112,I am a vicar in the Church of England Ive been a priest in the Church for  years For most of that time Ive been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of God Who is God And Im very aware that when you say the word God many people will turn off immediately And most people both within and outside the organized church still have a picture of a celestial controller a rule maker a policeman in the sky who orders everything and causes everything to happen He will protect his own people and answer the prayers of the faithful And in the worship of my church the most frequently used adjective about God is almighty But I have a problem with that I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that weve been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years Of course there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at God Exploring the feminine nurturing side of divinity Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness rather than power Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers I have chosen not to rock the boat Then on December th last year just two months ago that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami And two weeks later Sunday morning th of January I found myself standing in front of my congregation  intelligent well meaning mostly thoughtful Christian people  and I needed to express on their behalf our feelings and our questions I had my own personal responses but I also have a public role and something needed to be said And this is what I said Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury  fine title  about the tragedy in Southern Asia The essence of what he said was this the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen He wrote If some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense would we feel happier or safer or more confident in God If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now there are no words that we could say to him A verbal response would not be appropriate The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help It isnt a time for explanation or preaching or theology its a time for tears This is true And yet here we are my church in Oxford semidetached from events that happened a long way away but with our faith bruised And we want an explanation from God We demand an explanation from God Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain In some way God must feel the anguish and grief and physical pain that we feel In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within And if this is true it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit as well We want a God who can weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing restatement of Christian belief about God For hundreds of years the prevailing orthodoxy the accepted truth was that God the Father the Creator is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me And the devastating events of the th century have forced people to question the cold unfeeling God The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask Where is God in all this Who is God in all this And the answer was God is in this with us or God doesnt deserve our allegiance anymore If God is a bystander observing but not involved then God may well exist but we dont want to know about Him Many Jews and Christians now feel like this I know And I am among them So we have a suffering God  a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul I very much relate to this idea of God But it isnt enough I need to ask some more questions and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask as well some of you Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their preschool children And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock Perhaps some of you know it Some of the words go like this The foolish man built his house upon the sand  And the floods came up  And the house on the sand went crash Then in the same week at a funeral we sang the familiar hymn We Plow the Fields and Scatter a very English hymn In the second verse comes the line The wind and waves obey Him Do they I dont feel we can sing that song again in church after whats happened So the first big question is about control Does God have a plan for each of us Is God in control Does God order each moment Does the wind and the waves obey Him From time to time one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them so that everything worked out all right  some difficulty overcome some illness cured some trouble averted a parking space found at a crucial time I can remember someone saying this to me with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God But if God can or will do these things  intervene to change the flow of events  then surely he could have stopped the tsunami Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces but not big things like  mileperhour waves Thats just not acceptable to intelligent Christians and we must acknowledge it Either God is responsible for the tsunami or God is not in control After the tragedy survival stories began to emerge You probably heard some of them the man who surfed the wave the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hills The preacher delivered an extra long sermon so that they were still out of harms way when the wave struck Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them So the next question is about partiality Can we earn Gods favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him Does God demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant A God who looks after His own so that Christians are OK while everyone else perishes A cosmic us and them and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism That would be appalling and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity So who is God if not the great puppetmaster or the tribal protector Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen so that heroism and compassion can be shown Perhaps God is testing us testing our charity or our faith Perhaps there is a great cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out OK in the end Perhaps but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz In his great novel The Brothers Karamazov Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan addressed to his naive and devout younger brother Alyosha If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price We cannot afford to pay so much for admission It is not God that I do not accept I merely most respectfully return Him the ticket Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever so that natural processes could occur and evolution run its course This seems more acceptable but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility Is God a cold unfeeling spectator Or a powerless lover watching with infinite compassion things God is unable to control or change Is God intimately involved in our suffering so that He feels it in His own being If we believe something like this we must let go of the puppetmaster completely take our leave of the almighty controller abandon traditional models We must think again about God Maybe God doesnt do things at all Maybe God isnt an agent like all of us are agents Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person doing things all over the place Beating up the Egyptians drowning them in the Red Sea wasting cities getting angry The people knew their God by His mighty acts But what if God doesnt act What if God doesnt do things at all What if God is in things The loving soul of the universe An indwelling compassionate presence underpinning and sustaining all things What if God is in things In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life In the natural cycle of life and death the creation and destruction that must happen continuously In the process of evolution In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world In the collective unconscious the soul of the human race In you in me mind and body and spirit In the tsunami in the victims In the depth of things In presence and in absence In simplicity and complexity In change and development and growth How does this inness this innerness this interiority of God work Its hard to conceive and begs more questions Is God just another name for the universe with no independent existence at all I dont know To what extent can we ascribe personality to God I dont know In the end we have to say I dont know If we knew God would not be God To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements Isnt it ironic that Christians who claim to believe in an infinite unknowable being then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines How could one practice such a faith By seeking the God within By cultivating my own inwardness In silence in meditation in my inner space in the me that remains when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations In awareness of the inner conversation And how would we live such a faith How would I live such a faith By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep If God is in all people then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a threeway encounter There is an Indian greeting which Im sure some of you know Namaste accompanied by a respectful bow which roughly translated means That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you Namaste And how would one deepen such a faith By seeking the inwardness which is in all things In music and poetry in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life there is a deep indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami I had no answers to offer them No neat packages of faith with Bible references to prove them Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty I had some suggestions to make  possible new ways of thinking about God Ways that might allow us to go on down a new and uncharted road But in the end the only thing I could say for sure was I dont know and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all

113,"That splendid music the comingin music The Elephant March from Aida
is the music Ive chosen for my funeral And you can see why Its triumphal I wont feel anything but if I could I would feel triumphal
at having lived at all and at having lived
on this splendid planet and having been given
the opportunity to understand something about why I was here
in the first place before not being here Can you understand
my quaint English accent Like everybody else I was entranced
yesterday by the animal session Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others the beauty of the things that they showed The only slight jarring note was when
Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang the most splendid creatures
that God put on this earth Now of course we know
that he didnt really mean that but in this country at the moment
you cant be too careful Im a biologist and the central theorem
of our subject the theory of design Darwins theory of evolution
by natural selection In professional circles everywhere
its of course universally accepted In nonprofessional circles
outside America its largely ignored But in nonprofessional
circles within America it arouses so much hostility  its fair to say that American biologists
are in a state of war The war is so worrying at present with court cases coming
up in one state after another that I felt I had to say
something about it If you want to know what I have
to say about Darwinism itself Im afraid youre going
to have to look at my books which you wont find
in the bookstore outside Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly
new version of creationism called Intelligent Design or ID Dont be fooled
Theres nothing new about ID Its just creationism under another name rechristened 
I choose the word advisedly  for tactical political reasons The arguments of socalled ID theorists are the same old arguments
that had been refuted again and again since Darwin down to the present day There is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight
on behalf of science and I try to do all I can to help them but they get quite upset
when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists
as well as evolutionists They see us as rocking the boat
and you can understand why Creationists lacking any coherent
scientific argument for their case fall back on the popular
phobia against atheism Teach your children
evolution in biology class and theyll soon move on to drugs
grand larceny and sexual preversion In fact of course educated
theologians from the Pope down are firm in their support of evolution This book Finding
Darwins God by Kenneth Miller is one of the most effective attacks
on Intelligent Design that I know and its all the more effective because
its written by a devout Christian People like Kenneth Miller could be called
a godsend to the evolution lobby because they expose the lie
that evolutionism is as a matter of fact tantamount to atheism People like me on the other
hand rock the boat But here I want to say something
nice about creationists Its not a thing I often do
so listen carefully I think theyre right about one thing I think theyre right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion Ive already said that many individual
evolutionists like the Pope are also religious but I think
theyre deluding themselves I believe a true
understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith Now it may sound as though
Im about to preach atheism and I want to reassure you
that thats not what Im going to do In an audience
as sophisticated as this one that would be preaching to the choir No what I want to urge upon you  Instead what I want to urge
upon you is militant atheism But thats putting it too negatively If I was a person who were interested
in preserving religious faith I would be very afraid of the positive
power of evolutionary science and indeed science generally
but evolution in particular to inspire and enthrall
precisely because it is atheistic Now the difficult problem
for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical
improbability of living things Statistical improbability
in the direction of good design  complexity is another word for this The standard creationist argument  there is only one
theyre all reduced to this one  takes off from
a statistical improbability Living creatures are too complex
to have come about by chance therefore they must have had a designer This argument of course
shoots itself in the foot Any designer capable of designing
something really complex has to be even more complex himself and thats before we even start
on the other things hes expected to do like forgive sins bless
marriages listen to prayers  favor our side in a war  disapprove of our sex lives and so on Complexity is the problem
that any theory of biology has to solve and you cant solve it by postulating
an agent that is even more complex thereby simply compounding the problem Darwinian natural selection
is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem
of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity Essentially it does it
by providing a smooth ramp of gradual stepbystep increment But here I only want to make the point that the elegance of Darwinism
is corrosive to religion precisely because it is so elegant
so parsimonious so powerful so economically powerful It has the sinewy economy
of a beautiful suspension bridge The God theory is not just a bad theory It turns out to be  in principle  incapable of doing the job required of it So returning to tactics
and the evolution lobby I want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do My approach to attacking creationism is  unlike the evolution lobby  my approach to attacking creationism
is to attack religion as a whole And at this point I need
to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion and Im going to do so in the words
of the late Douglas Adams a dear friend who
if he never came to TED certainly should have been invited Richard Saul Wurman He was Richard Dawkins He was Good
I thought he must have been He begins this speech
which was tape recorded in Cambridge shortly before he died  he begins by explaining how science
works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable
to disproof and then he goes on I quote Religion doesnt
seem to work like that It has certain ideas at the heart of it
which we call sacred or holy What it means is
here is an idea or a notion that youre not allowed
to say anything bad about Youre just not Why not
Because youre not Why should it be
that its perfectly legitimate to support the Republicans or Democrats this model of economics versus that Macintosh instead of Windows but to have an opinion
about how the universe began about who created the universe  no thats holy So were used to not
challenging religious ideas and its very interesting how much
of a furor Richard creates when he does it  He meant me not that one Everybody gets absolutely
frantic about it because youre not allowed
to say these things Yet when you look at it rationally theres no reason why those ideas shouldnt be as open
to debate as any other except that weve agreed
somehow between us that they shouldnt be And thats the end
of the quote from Douglas In my view not only is science
corrosive to religion religion is corrosive to science It teaches people
to be satisfied with trivial supernatural nonexplanations and blinds them to the wonderful
real explanations that we have within our grasp It teaches them to accept
authority revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence Theres Douglas Adams magnificent picture
from his book Last Chance to See Now theres a typical scientific journal The Quarterly Review of Biology And Im going to put
together as guest editor a special issue on the question
Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs And the first paper
is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence Iridium layer at the KT boundary and potassium argon dated
crater in Yucatan indicate that an asteroid
killed the dinosaurs Perfectly ordinary scientific paper Now the next one The President of the Royal Society has been vouchsafed
a strong inner conviction that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs It has been privately
revealed to Professor Huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs Professor Hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith  Laughter  that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs Professor Hawkins has
promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal Hawkinsians that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs Thats inconceivable of course But suppose  Supporters of the Asteroid Theory
cannot be patriotic citizens In  a reporter asked George Bush Sr whether he recognized
the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists Mr Bushs reply has become infamous No I dont know that atheists
should be considered citizens nor should they be considered patriots This is one nation under God Bushs bigotry
was not an isolated mistake blurted out in the heat
of the moment and later retracted He stood by it in the face of repeated
calls for clarification or withdrawal He really meant it More to the point he knew
it posed no threat to his election  quite the contrary Democrats as well as Republicans
parade their religiousness if they want to get elected Both parties invoke
one nation under God What would Thomas Jefferson have said In every country and in every age
the priest has been hostile to liberty Incidentally Im not usually
very proud of being British but you cant help making the comparison In practice what is an atheist An atheist is just somebody
who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels
about Thor or Baal or the golden calf As has been said before we are
all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in Some of us just go one god further And however we define atheism
its surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled
to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic
unelectable noncitizen Nevertheless its an undeniable fact
that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself
as Mr Hitler or Miss Beelzebub And that all stems
from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird wayout minority Natalie Angier wrote a rather
sad piece in the New Yorker saying how lonely she felt as an atheist She clearly feels
in a beleaguered minority But actually how do American atheists
stack up numerically The latest survey makes
surprisingly encouraging reading Christianity of course takes a massive
lions share of the population with nearly  million But what would you think
was the second largest group convincingly outnumbering Jews
with  million Muslims at  million Hindus Buddhists and all other
religions put together The second largest group
with nearly  million is the one described
as nonreligious or secular You cant help wondering
why voteseeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power
of for example the Jewish lobby  the state of Israel seems to owe its very
existence to the American Jewish vote  while at the same time consigning the nonreligious
to political oblivion This secular nonreligious vote
if properly mobilized is nine times as numerous
as the Jewish vote Why does this far more
substantial minority not make a move to exercise
its political muscle Well so much for quantity
How about quality Is there any correlation
positive or negative between intelligence
and tendency to be religious Them folks misunderestimated me The survey that I quoted
which is the ARIS survey didnt break down its data
by socioeconomic class or education IQ or anything else But a recent article by Paul G Bell
in the Mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind Mensa as you know
is an international organization for people with very high IQ And from a metaanalysis
of the literature Bell concludes that I quote 
Of  studies carried out since  on the relationship
between religious belief and ones intelligence
or educational level all but four found an inverse connection That is the higher ones intelligence
or educational level the less one is likely to be religious Well I havent seen
the original  studies and I cant comment on that metaanalysis but I would like to see more
studies done along those lines And I know that there are 
if I could put a little plug here  there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive
research survey to settle the question and I put the suggestion up
for what its worth But let me know show you some data that have been properly
published and analyzed on one special group 
namely top scientists In  Larson and Witham
polled the cream of American scientists those whod been honored by election
to the National Academy of Sciences and among this select group belief in a personal God dropped
to a shattering seven percent About  percent are agnostic
the rest could fairly be called atheists Similar figures obtained
for belief in personal immortality Among biological scientists
the figure is even lower  percent only believe in God Physical scientists its  percent Ive not seen corresponding
figures for elite scholars in other fields
such as history or philosophy but Id be surprised
if they were different So weve reached a truly
remarkable situation a grotesque mismatch
between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate A philosophical opinion
about the nature of the universe which is held by the vast majority
of top American scientists and probably the majority
of the intelligentsia generally is so abhorrent to the American electorate that no candidate for popular election
dare affirm it in public If Im right this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people
best qualified to hold it  the intelligentsia  unless they are prepared
to lie about their beliefs To put it bluntly
American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously
intelligent and honest Im not a citizen of this country
so I hope it wont be thought unbecoming if I suggest that something
needs to be done And Ive already hinted
what that something is From what Ive seen of TED I think this
may be the ideal place to launch it Again I fear it will cost money We need a consciousnessraising comingout campaign for American atheists This could be similar to the campaign
organized by homosexuals a few years ago although heaven forbid
that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will In most cases people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that
there is something wrong with atheists On the contrary theyll demonstrate that atheists
are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent
role models for your children the kinds of people an advertising agent
could use to recommend a product the kinds of people
who are sitting in this room There should be a snowball effect
a positive feedback such that the more names
we have the more we get There could be nonlinearities
threshold effects When a critical mass has been obtained theres an abrupt
acceleration in recruitment And again it will need money I suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion
to what it actually means and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be
happy to out themselves So what other words might
be used to smooth the path oil the wheels sugar the pill Darwin himself preferred agnostic  and not only out of loyalty
to his friend Huxley who coined the term Darwin said I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying
the existence of a God I think that generally an agnostic would be the most correct
description of my state of mind He even became uncharacteristically
tetchy with Edward Aveling Aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication
of his book on atheism  incidentally giving rise
to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx tried to dedicate
Das Kapital to Darwin which he didnt it was
actually Edward Aveling What happened was that Avelings
mistress was Marxs daughter and when both Darwin and Marx were dead Marxs papers became muddled
up with Avelings papers and a letter from Darwin saying
My dear sir thank you very much but I dont want you
to dedicate your book to me was mistakenly supposed
to be addressed to Marx and that gave rise to this whole
myth which youve probably heard Its a sort of urban myth that Marx
tried to dedicate Kapital to Darwin Anyway it was Aveling and when
they met Darwin challenged Aveling Why do you call yourselves atheists Agnostic  retorted Aveling was
simply atheist writ respectable and atheist was simply
agnostic writ aggressive Darwin complained But why
should you be so aggressive Darwin thought that atheism might be
well and good for the intelligentsia but that ordinary people were
not quote ripe for it Which is of course our old friend
the dont rock the boat argument Its not recorded whether Aveling told
Darwin to come down off his high horse But in any case
that was more than  years ago Youd think we might have
grown up since then Now a friend an intelligent lapsed Jew who incidentally observes the Sabbath
for reasons of cultural solidarity describes himself
as a toothfairy agnostic He wont call himself an atheist because its in principle
impossible to prove a negative but agnostic on its own might
suggest that Gods existence was therefore on equal terms
of likelihood as his nonexistence So my friend is strictly
agnostic about the tooth fairy but it isnt very likely is it Like God Hence the phrase toothfairy agnostic Bertrand Russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot
in orbit about Mars You would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot
in orbit about Mars but that doesnt mean you treat
the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its nonexistence The list of things which we strictly
have to be agnostic about doesnt stop at tooth fairies
and teapots its infinite If you want to believe
one particular one of them  unicorns or tooth fairies
or teapots or Yahweh  the onus is on you to say why The onus is not on the rest
of us to say why not We who are atheists are also afairyists and ateapotists But we dont bother to say so And this is why my friend
uses toothfairy agnostic as a label for what most people
would call atheist Nonetheless if we want to attract
deepdown atheists to come out publicly were going to have find
something better to stick on our banner than toothfairy or teapot agnostic So how about humanist This has the advantage of a worldwide
network of wellorganized associations and journals and things already in place My problem with it is only
its apparent anthropocentrism One of the things
weve learned from Darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins
some close some distant And there are other possibilities
like naturalist but that also has problems of confusion because Darwin would have
thought naturalist  Naturalist means of course
as opposed to supernaturalist  and it is used sometimes  Darwin would have been confused
by the other sense of naturalist which he was of course and I suppose there might be others
who would confuse it with nudism Such people might be those
belonging to the British lynch mob which last year attacked a pediatrician
in mistake for a pedophile I think the best of the available
alternatives for atheist is simply nontheist It lacks the strong connotation
that theres definitely no God and it could therefore easily be embraced
by teapot or toothfairy agnostics Its completely compatible
with the God of the physicists When atheists like Stephen Hawking
and Albert Einstein use the word God they use it of course
as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics
which we dont yet understand Nontheist will do for all that
yet unlike atheist it doesnt have the same
phobic hysterical responses But I think actually the alternative is to grasp the nettle
of the word atheism itself precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia Critical mass may be harder
to achieve with the word atheist than with the word nontheist or some other nonconfrontational word But if we did achieve it
with that dread word atheist itself the political impact
would be even greater Now I said that if I were religious
Id be very afraid of evolution  Id go further I would fear science
in general if properly understood And this is because
the scientific worldview is so much more exciting more poetic more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the povertystricken
arsenals of the religious imagination As Carl Sagan another recently
dead hero put it How is it that hardly any major
religion has looked at science and concluded This
is better than we thought The universe is much bigger
than our prophet said grander more subtle more elegant Instead they say No no no My god is a little god
and I want him to stay that way A religion old or new that stressed the magnificence
of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth
reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths Now this is an elite audience and I would therefore expect
about  percent of you to be religious Many of you probably subscribe
to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion But I also suspect
that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as I do If youre one of them and of course
many of you may not be but if you are one of them Im asking you to stop being polite come out and say so And if you happen to be rich give some thought to ways
in which you might make a difference The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations 
to say nothing of all the tax benefits  by foundations such as the Templeton
Foundation and the Discovery Institute We need an antiTempleton to step forward If my books sold as well
as Stephen Hawkings books instead of only as well as
Richard Dawkins books Id do it myself People are always going on about
How did September the th change you Well heres how it changed me Lets all stop being so damned respectful Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

114,I just want to say over the last few years Ive been  had the opportunity to do this closing conference And Ive had some incredible warmup acts About eight years ago Billy Graham opened for me And I thought that there was  I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that But I just wanted to say  and I mean this without irony  I think I can speak for everybody in the audience when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States OK this is the title of my talk today I just want to give you a quick overview First of all please remember Im completely politically correct and I mean everything with great affection If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy now is the time to check your Blackberry Just to review this is my TEDTalk Were going to do some jokes some gags some little skits  and then were going to talk about the L point So one of the questions I ask myself is was this the most distressing TED ever Lets try and sum things up shall we Images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox  percent of the conference Mentions of polar bears drowning four percent Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu  percent And David Pogue singing show tunes Because this is the most distressing TED ever Ive been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next years TED Bag And if the  if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then were going to have a scream bag next year Its going to be a cradletocradle scream bag of course So youre going to be able to go like this Bring it over here and open it up Aaaah Meanwhile back at TED University this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips So Robert Wright  I dont know I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels He was talking about morality Economy class morality is we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age Business class morality is dont bomb Japan  they built my car And firstclass morality is dont bomb Mexico  they clean my house Yes it is politically incorrect All right now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you  All right now these are the wha  Id say mumble mumble  mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble  ahh So I wanted to show you guys  I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you  as a completely natural user interface And you can  you can use really natural hand gestures to like go like this Now we had a Harvard professor here  she was from Harvard I just wanted to mention and  and she was actually a professor from Harvard And she was talking about sevendimensional inverted universes With you know of course theres the gravity brain Theres the weak brain And then theres my weak brain which is too  too  absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about Now  one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for And thats why I went out and I picked up a bestselling business book You know it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology And its by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren and its called The Porpoise Driven Life And Rick is as a pagan god which I thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way And now were going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren OK All right Now red is Rick Warren and green is Daniel Dennett OK The scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to  percent Bible literally true And then this is books sold  the logarithmic scale   three million  million  million OK now theyre duking it out Now theyre duking it out And Rick Warrens kind of pulling ahead kind of pulling ahead Yup and his installed base is getting a little bigger But Darwins dangerous idea is coming back Its coming back Let me turn the trails on so you can see that a little bit better Now one of the things thats very important is Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per  Im sorry  about One Laptop Per Child Now lets talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device Ill tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then Ill show it to you in person First of all it needs to be small It needs to be flat so its transportable Lightweight Portable Uses very very little power Very very high resolution Has to be visible in bright daylight Will work anywhere And broadly applicable across many platforms Now weve actually done some research  Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market They did some research we came back and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for And here it is the  computer OK OK OK OK  excellent excellent Now I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about  bucks And he and his team of juniorhigh school students were doing real science So were trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana See who uses marijuana Are we going to be able to find any marijuana Jim Young Only if we open enough locker doors OK now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness We had Dr Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox We start This is day one Day two Day three she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder Day three Day four Day five and day six Now the good news is because Im a trained medical professional I know that even though shell be scarred for life shes going to make a full recovery Now the good news about Architects for Humanity is theyre really kind of the most amazing group Theyve been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions in Africa and theyve had a design competition Now the wonderful thing is Larry Brilliant was just appointed the head of the Google Foundation and so he decided that he would support  he would support Camerons work And the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over  shipping containers of Google snacks So I want to show you some prototypes The UN  you know they took  years just to add a flap to a tent but I think we have some more exciting things This is a home made entirely out of Fruit RollUps And those rollup cookies coated with white chocolate And the really wonderful thing about this is when youre done well  you can eat it But the thing that Im really really excited about is this incredible granola house And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof to collect water and recycle it And its  well on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids and Gummy Bears to let in the light But on this side it has sugary Gummy Bears to diffuse the light more slightly And we  we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ So Einstein  Einstein tell me  whats your favorite song No I said whats your favorite song No I said whats your favorite song Free Bird OK so Einstein whats your favorite singing group Could you say that again Whats your favorite singing group OK one more time  Im just going to give you a little help Your favorite singing group  its Diana Ross and the  Audience Supremes Tom Reilly Exactly Could we have the sound up on the laptop please Free Bird kind of reminds me that if you  if you listen to Free Bird backwards this is what you might hear Computer Satan Satan Satan Satan Satan Satan Satan TR Now its a little hard to hear the whole message so I wanted to  so I wanted to help you a little bit Computer My sweet Satan Dan Dennett worships Satan Buy The PurposeDriven Life or Satan will take your soul TR So weve talked a lot about global warming but you know as Jill said it sounds kind of nice  good weather in the wintertime and New York City And as Jay Walker pointed out that is just not scary enough So Al I actually think Im rather good at branding So Ive tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace global warming So we started with Babel Fish We put in global warming And then we decided that wed change it from English to Dutch  into Het globale Verwarmen From Dutch to Korean into Hordahordaneecheewa Korean to Portuguese Aquecerse Global Then Portuguese to Pig Latin Aquecerse uckedfay And then finally back into the English which is were totally fucked Now I dont know about you but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings  evolutionarily theyre designed to see patterns in things For example in cheese sandwiches Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary I tried to make it a little bit clearer Is it the Virgin Mary Or is it Mena Trott So I talked to Josh PrinceRamus about the convention center and the conferences Its getting awfully big Its getting just a little bit too big Its bursting at the seams here a little bit So we tried to come up with a program  how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED So first of all we decided  that we needed about onethird bookstore onethird Google cafe about  percent registration  percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms And then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the Steinbeck forum Now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program So first one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming and Greenland melts as you say the ocean level is going to rise  feet and flood the hell out of the convention center So were going to build this new building on stilts So we build this building on stilts then up here  is where were going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is its going to be shaped in a spiral thats organized by the Dewey Decimal System Then were going to make an escalator that helps you get up there And finally were going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top Now I dont know about you but sometimes I have these images in my head of separated at birth I dont know about you but when I see Aubrey de Grey I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey OK Now weve heard of course that were all soldiers here So what Id really really like you to do now is pick up your white piece of paper Does everybody have their white piece of paper And I want you to get out a pen and I want you to write a terrorist note If we put up the ELMO for a moment  if we put up the ELMO then well get you know Ill give you a model that you can work from OK And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane And once youve folded it into a paper airplane I want you to take some anthrax  and I want you to put that in the paper airplane And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young Luckily I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year And I wanted to see  I want to dedicate this film to my father Homer OK Now this film isnt really hard enough so I wanted to make it a little bit harder So Im going to try and do this while reciting pi              Can we cue the music please Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit Back in  you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain was covered in  inches of snow pack Parenthetically over there on the slopes I did want to show you that black men ski But over the years  years later the snow packs eroded and if you notice the trees have started turning yellow The water level of the lake has started drying up A few years later theres no snow left at all And all the trees have turned brown This year unfortunately the lakebeds turned into an absolute cracked dry bed And I fear if we do nothing for our planet in  years its going to look like this Mr Vice President I wish I knew how to quit you Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

116,How many Creationists do we have in the room Probably none I think were all Darwinians And yet many Darwinians are anxious a little uneasy  would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes Its all right You know spiderwebs Sure they are products of evolution The World Wide Web Not so sure Beaver dams yes Hoover Dam no What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves fruits of the tree of life and hence in some sense obeying evolutionary rules And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking  to our thinking And so Im going to talk a little bit about that keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here So youre out in the woods or youre out in the pasture and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass It climbs up to the top and it falls and it climbs and it falls and it climbs  trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass What is this ant doing What is this in aid of What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass Whats in it for the ant And the answer is nothing Theres nothing in it for the ant Well then why is it doing this Is it just a fluke Yeah its just a fluke Its a lancet fluke Its a little brain worm Its a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant crawl into its brain and drive it up a blade of grass like an allterrain vehicle So theres nothing in it for the ant The ants brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain inducing suicidal behavior Pretty scary Well does anything like that happen with human beings This is all on behalf of a cause other than ones own genetic fitness of course Well it may already have occurred to you that Islam means surrender or submission of selfinterest to the will of Allah Well its ideas  not worms  that hijack our brains Now am I saying that a sizable minority of the worlds population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas No its worse than that Most people have There are a lot of ideas to die for Freedom if youre from New Hampshire Justice Truth Communism Many people have laid down their lives for communism and many have laid down their lives for capitalism And many for Catholicism And many for Islam These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for Theyre infectious Yesterday Amory Lovins spoke about infectious repititis It was a term of abuse in effect This is unthinking engineering Well most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant new outofthebox thinking Its infectious repetitis and we might as well try to have a theory of whats going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others I myself am a philosopher and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is And you have to have a bumper sticker you know You have to have a statement So this is mine The secret of happiness is Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it Most of us  now that the Me Decade is well in the past  now we actually do this One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives This is what our summum bonum is Its not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have Now this is a profound biological effect Its the subordination of genetic interest to other interests And no other species does anything at all like it Well how are we going to think about this It is on the one hand a biological effect and a very large one Unmistakable Now what theories do we want to use to look at this Well many theories But how could something tie them together The idea of replicating ideas ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain Richard Dawkins whom youll be hearing later in the day invented the term memes and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book The Selfish Gene Now here am I talking about his idea Well you see its not his Yes  he started it But its everybodys idea now And hes not responsible for what I say about memes Im responsible for what I say about memes Actually I think were all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas but for their likely misuses So it is important I think to Richard and to me that these ideas not be abused and misused Theyre very easy to misuse Thats why theyre dangerous And its just about a fulltime job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another So we have to keep plugging away trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread But it is a problem We dont have much time and Im going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out because theres a lot of other things that are going to be said So let me just point out memes are like viruses Thats what Richard said back in  And you might think Well how can that be I mean a virus is  you know its stuff Whats a meme made of Yesterday Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but  whats a virus A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude That is there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does And thats what a meme is Its an information packet with attitude Whats a meme made of What are bits made of Mom Not silicon Theyre made of information and can be carried in any physical medium Whats a word made of Sometimes when people say Do memes exist I say Well do words exist Are they in your ontology If they are words are memes that can be pronounced Then theres all the other memes that cant be pronounced There are different species of memes Remember the Shakers Gift to be simple Simple beautiful furniture And of course theyre basically extinct now And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shakerdom is that one should be celibate Not just the priests Everybody Well its not so surprising that theyve gone extinct Laughter But in fact thats not why they went extinct They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets werent there And there were lots of widows and orphans people like that who needed a foster home And so they had a ready supply of converts And they could keep it going And in principle it couldve gone on forever with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts The idea being passed on through proselytizing instead of through the gene line So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that theyre not being passed on genetically A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness After all the meme for Shakerdom was essentially a sterilizing parasite There are other parasites that do this  which render the host sterile Its part of their plan They dont have to have minds to have a plan Im just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective which I recommend Ive not time to go into more of it In Jared Diamonds wonderful book Guns Germs and Steel he talks about how it was germs more than guns and steel that conquered the new hemisphere  the Western hemisphere  that conquered the rest of the world When European explorers and travelers spread out they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years thousands of years of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens And they just wiped out  these pathogens just wiped out the native people who had no immunity to them at all And were doing it again Were doing it this time with toxic ideas Yesterday a number of people  Nicholas Negroponte and others  spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out thanks to all the new technology all over the world And I agree It is largely wonderful Largely wonderful But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology are a lot of toxic ideas Now this has been realized for some time Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden One has only to glance at its press films fashion shows beauty contests ballrooms wine bars and broadcasting stations Memes These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures They are wiping out languages They are wiping out traditions and practices And its not our fault anymore than its our fault when our germs lay waste to people that havent developed the immunity We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture Were a free society so we let pornography and all these things  we shrug them off Theyre like a mild cold Theyre not a big deal for us But we should recognize that for many people in the world they are a big deal And we should be very alert to this As we spread our education and our technology one of the things that we are doing is were the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes  the memes that they are prepared to die for Well now how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes That is not the job of the science of memetics Memetics is morally neutral And so it should be This is not the place for hate and anger If youve had a friend whos died of AIDS then you hate HIV But the way to deal with that is to do science and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective Get the facts Work out the implications Theres plenty of room for moral passion once weve got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do And as with germs the trick is not to try to annihilate them You will never annihilate the germs What you can do however is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties Thats all the time I have so thank you very much for your attention

118,Sergey Brin I want to discuss a question I know thats been pressing on many of your minds We spoke to you last several years ago And before I get started today since many of you are wondering I just wanted to get it out of the way The answer is boxers Now I hope all of you feel better Do you know what this might be Does anyone know what that is Audience Yes SB What is it Audience Its people logging on to Google around the world SB Wow OK I didnt really realize what it was when I first saw it But this is what helped me see it This is what we run at the office that actually runs real time Here its slightly logged But here you can see around the world how people are using Google And every one of those rising dots represents probably about   searches or something like that And theyre labeled by color right now by language So you can see here we are in the US and theyre all coming up red There we are in Monterey  hopefully I can get it right You can see that Japan is busy at night right there We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese Theres a lot of activity in China Theres a lot of activity in India Theres some in the Middle East the little pockets And Europe which is right now in the middle of the day is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages Now you can also see if I turn this around here  hopefully I wont shake the world too much But you can also see there are places where theres not so much Australia because there just arent very many people there And this is something that we should really work on which is Africa which is just a few trickles basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities But basically what weve noticed is these queries which come in at thousands per second are available everywhere there is power And pretty much everywhere there is power there is the Internet And even in Antarctica  well at least this time of year  we from time to time will see a query rising up And if we had it plotted correctly I think the International Space Station would have it too So this is some of the challenge that we have here is you can see that its actually kind of hard to get the  there we go This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions You can see that theres a lot of data running around It has to go all over the world through fibers through satellites through all kinds of connections And its pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to Hopefully your experience is good But you can see also once again  so some places are much more wired than others and you can see all the bandwidth across the US going up over to Asia Europe in the other direction and so forth Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like And if we can switch to slides  all right here we go So this is slowed down This is what one second looks like And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load Now each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own I mean it could be somebodys health it could be somebodys career something important to them And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce or in this case ketchup So this is a query that we had  I guess its a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others You can see that it got started right here In the US and Spain it was popular at the same time But it didnt have quite the same pickup in the US as it did in Spain And then from Spain it went to Italy and then Germany got excited and maybe right now the UK is enjoying it And so I guess the US finally finally started to like it too And I just wanted to play it for you Anyway you can all enjoy it for yourselves  hopefully that search will work As a part of  you know part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated More animals if they start doing searches as well But partly we want to make the world a better place and so one thing that were embarking upon is the Google Foundation and were in the process of setting that up We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over  different charities around the world and these are some of the charities that are on there And its something Im very excited to be a part of In fact many of the organizations that are here  the Acumen Fund I think ApproTEC we have running Im not sure if that ones up yet  and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants They run Google ads and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know One of the earlier results that we got  we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of  Vietnamese girls for their education and that was one of the earliest results And as I said now there have been many many stories that have come in because we do have hundreds of charities in there and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor Now does anybody know who this is Aha Audience Orkut SB Yes Somebody got it This is Orkut Is anybody here on Orkut Do we have any Okay not very many people know about it Ill explain it in a second This is one of our engineers We find that they work better when theyre submerged and covered with leaves Thats how we churn those products out Orkut had a vision to create a social network I know all of you are thinking Yet another social network But it was a dream of his and we basically when people really want to do something well we generally let them So this is what he built We just released it in a test phase last month and its been taking off This is our VP of Engineering You can see the red hair and I dont know if you can see the nose ring there And these are all of his friends So this is how  we just deployed it  we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out And now weve grown to over  members And they spread actually very quickly even outside the US You can see even though the US is still the majority here  though by the way searchwise its only about  percent of our traffic  but its already going to Japan and the UK and Europe and all the rest of the countries So its a fun little project There are a variety of demographics I wont bore you with these But its just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes And  well Ill leave you in suspense Larry you can explain this one Larry Page Thank you Sergey So one of the things  both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school and I think for some reason this has been incorporated in Google And Sergey mentioned Orkut which is something that you know Orkut wanted to do in his time and we call this  at Google weve embodied this as the  percent time and the idea is for  percent of your time if youre working at Google you can do what you think is the best thing to do And many many things at Google have come out of that such as Orkut and also Google News And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this Mendel who was supposed to be teaching highschool students actually you know discovered the laws of genetics  as a hobby basically So many many useful things come out of this And News which I just mentioned was started by a researcher And he just  he  after  he got really interested in the news And he said Why dont I look at the news better And so he started clustering it by category and then he started using it and then his friends started using it And then besides just looking cute on a babys bottom we made it a Googlette which is basically a small project at Google So itd be like three people or something like that and they would try to make a product And we wouldnt really be sure if its going to work or not And in News case you know they had a couple of people working on it for a while and then more and more people started using it and then we put it out on the Internet and more and more people started using it And now its a real fullblown project with more people on it And this is how we keep our innovation running I think usually as companies get bigger they find it really hard to have small innovative projects And we had this problem too for a while and we said Oh we really need a new concept You know the Googlettes  thats a small project that were not quite sure if its going to work or not but we hope it will and if we do enough of them some of them will really work and turn out such as News But then we had a problem because then we had over  projects And I dont know about all of you but I have trouble keeping  things in my head at once And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them  and these are kind of made up Dont really pay attention to them For example the Buy Iceland was from a media article We would never do such a crazy thing but  in any case we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be And this was kind of a surprise to me but we found that as long as you keep the  things in your head which you did by writing them down that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources And so thats basically what weve done since we instituted that a few years ago and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably wellorganized The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important and so naturally people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new or you might not know about And the top thing actually is the Deskbar So this is a new  how many of you use the Google Toolbar Raise your hands How many of you use the Deskbar All right see You guys should try it out But if you go to our site and search for Deskbar youll get this And the idea is instead of a toolbar its just present all the time on your screen on the bottom and you can do searches really easily And its sort of like a better version of the toolbar Thank you Sergey This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about and they just they got going and its really really a great product and really taking off Google Answers is something we started which is really cool which lets you  for five to  dollars you can type a question in and then theres a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you and its guaranteed and all that and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself Froogle lets you search shopping information and Blogger lets you publish things But all of these  well these were all sort of innovative things that we did that  you know we try many many different things in our company We also like to innovate in our physical space and we noticed in meetings you know you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off and theyre noisy so people shut them off And we didnt like that so we actually in maybe a couple of weeks we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors and so we can leave them on all the time and theyre completely silent And as a result we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting so when you walk into a meeting room now it lists all the meetings that are happening you can very easily take notes and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting And as we become more of a global company we find these things really affect us  you know can we work effectively with people who arent in the room And things like that And simple things like this can really make a big difference We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings and they dont always do their laundry as much as they should And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines for our younger employees especially and  we also allow dogs and things like that and weve had I think a really fun culture at our company which helps people work and enjoy what theyre doing This is actually our cult picture I just wanted to show quickly We had this on our website for a while but we found that after we put it on our website we didnt get any job applications anymore But anyway every year weve taken the whole company on a ski trip A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other and informally And I think weve done a good job encouraging that It makes it a really fun place to work Along with our logos too which I think really embody our culture when we change things In the early days we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand you know because you know youd never want to change your logo You want it to be consistent And we said Well that doesnt sound so much fun Why dont we try changing it every day One of the things that really excites me about what were doing now is we have this thing called AdSense and this is a little bit foreshadowing  this is from before Dean dropped out But the idea is like on a newspaper for example we show you relevant ads And this is hard to read but this says Battle for New Hampshire Howard Dean for President  articles on Howard Dean And these ads are generated automatically  like in this case on the Washington Post  from the content on the site And so we use our over  advertisers and millions of advertisements so we pick the one thats most relevant to what youre actually looking at much as we do on search So the idea is we can make advertising useful not just annoying right And the nice thing about this we have a selfserve program and many thousands of websites have signed up and this lets them really make money And I  you know theres a number of people I met  I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party and he said You know I wasnt making any money I just put this thing on my site and Im making  dollars a month And you know thank you I dont have to do my other job now And I think this is really important for us because it makes the Internet work better It makes content get better it makes searching work better when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content So this session is supposed to be about the future so Id thought Id talk at least briefly about it And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search you really have to be smart Because you can type you know any kind of thing into Google and you expect an answer back right But finding things is tricky and so you really want intelligence And in fact the ultimate search engine would be smart It would be artificial intelligence And so thats something we work on and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now and thats really their goal So we always hope that Google will be smart but were always surprised when other people think that it is And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this This is a blog from Iraq and its not really what Im going to talk about but I just wanted to show you an example Maybe Sergey you can highlight this So we decided  actually the highlights right there Oh thank you So related searches right there You cant see it that well but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads called related searches And so wed say you know Did you mean search for  what is this in this case Saddam Hussein because this blog is about Iraq  and you know in addition to the ads and we thought this would be a great idea And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed and he said You know Im sleeping a lot He was just kind of writing about his life And our algorithms  not a person of course but our algorithms our computers  read his blog and decided that the related search was I am bored And he read this and he thought a person had decided that he was boring and it was very unfortunate and he said You know what are these you know bastards at Google doing Why dont they like my blog And so then we read his blog which was getting  you know sort of going from bad to worse and we said the related search was Retards And then you know he got even more mad and he wrote  like started swearing and so on And then we produced You suck And finally it ended with Kiss my ass And so basically he thought he was dealing with something smart and of course you know we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out and it didnt quite work and we dont have this feature anymore So with that maybe I can switch back to the world I wanted to end just by saying that theres a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google and one of those is that were able to make money largely through advertising and one of the benefits that I didnt expect from that was that were able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about you know places that dont have as much money So we dont have to worry about our products being sold for example for less money in places that are poor and then they get reimported into the US  for example with the drug industry And I think were really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search and I think thats a tremendous tremendous benefit The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine  that we should provide very objective information And so in our search results we never accept payment for our search results We accept payment for advertising and we mark it as such And thats unlike many of our competitors And I think decisions were able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google So thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

121,The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible We cant overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this And mostly I want to persuade you that we have to do better if were going to continue the project of civilization in America By the way this doesnt help Nobodys having a better day down here because of that There are a lot of ways you can describe this You know I like to call it the national automobile slum You can call it suburban sprawl I think its appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck And its a tremendous problem for us The outstanding  the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about Were going to talk about that some more A sense of place your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings and to employ the vocabularies grammars syntaxes rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are The public realm in America has two roles it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life and it is the physical manifestation of the common good And when you degrade the public realm you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we dont have the yearold cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design This is a body of knowledge method skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we dont need that anymore were not going to use it And consequently we can see the result all around us The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically but it has to inform us where we are in our culture Where weve come from what kind of people we are and it needs to by doing that it needs to afford us a glimpse to where were going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present And if there is one tremendous  if there is one great catastrophe about the places that weve built the human environments weve made for ourselves in the last  years it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present The environments we are living in more typically are like these You know this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town And remember to create a place of character and quality you have to be able to define space So how is that being accomplished here If you stand on the apron of the WalMart over here and try to look at the Target store over here you cant see it because of the curvature of the Earth Laughter Thats natures way of telling you that youre doing a poor job of defining space Consequently these will be places that nobody wants to be in These will be places that are not worth caring about We have about you know  places that are not worth caring about in the United States today When we have enough of them were going to have a nation thats not worth defending And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq spilling their blood in the sand and ask yourself What is their last thought of home I hope its not the curb cut between the Chuck E Cheese and the Target store because thats not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for Applause We need better places in this country Public space This is a good public space Its a place worth caring about Its well defined It is emphatically an outdoor public room It has something that is terribly important  it has whats called an active and permeable membrane around the edge Thats a fancy way of saying its got shops bars bistros destinations  things go in and out of it Its permeable The beer goes in and out the waitresses go in and out and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in You know in these places in other cultures people just go there voluntarily because they like them We dont have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here Laughter You know you dont have to have a Kwanzaa festival People just go because its pleasurable to be there But this is how we do it in the United States Probably the most significant public space failure in America designed by the leading architects of the day Harry Cobb and IM Pei Boston City Hall Plaza A public place so dismal that the winos dont even want to go there Laughter And we cant fix it because IM Peis still alive and every year Harvard and MIT have a joint committee to repair it And every year they fail to because they dont want to hurt IM Peis feelings This is the other side of the building This was the winner of an international design award in I think  something like that It wasnt Pei and Cobb another firm designed this but theres not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block This is the back of Boston City Hall the most important you know significant civic building in Albany  excuse me  in Boston And what is the message that is coming what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building and how is it informing us about who we are This in fact would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin Pol Pot Saddam Hussein and all the other great despots of the th century on the side of the building because then wed honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us You know that its a despotic building it wants us to feel like termites Laughter This is it on a smaller scale the back of the civic center in my town Saratoga Springs New York By the way when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken Laughter and they shouted at me and said It was raining that day when you took that picture Because this was perceived to be a weather problem Laughter You know this is a building designed like a DVD player Laughter Audio jack power supply  and look you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms right You know we hire firms to design these things You can see exactly what went on three oclock in the morning at the design meeting You know eight hours before deadline four architects trying to get this building in on time right And theyre sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings and the renderings and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table and  I mean what was the conversation that was going on there Laughter Because you know what the last word was what the last sentence was of that meeting It was Fuck it Laughter Applause That  that is the message of this form of architecture The message is We dont give a fuck We dont give a fuck So I went back on the nicest day of the year just to  you know  do some reality testing and in fact he will not even go down there because Laughter its not interesting enough for his clients you know the burglars the muggers Its not civically rich enough for them to go down there OK The pattern of Main Street USA  in fact this pattern of building downtown blocks all over the world is fairly universal Its not that complicated buildings more than one story high built out to the sidewalk edge so that people who are you know all kinds of people can get into the building Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs you know apartments offices and so on You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor They havent learned that in Monterey If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center youll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner Its really incredible Anyway this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building and this is what happened when in Glens Falls New York when we tried to do it again where it was missing right So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty OK That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk where the theoretical pedestrians are Laughter Of course theyll never be there as long as this is in that condition Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed we pop a handicapped ramp on that and then to make ourselves feel better we put a nature BandAid in front of it And thats how we do it I call them nature BandAids because theres a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature And in fact the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism good buildings Not just flower beds not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains You know thats not good enough We have to do good buildings The street trees have really four jobs to do and thats it To spatially denote the pedestrian realm to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling  a vaulted ceiling  over the street at its best And thats it Those are the four jobs of the street trees Theyre not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods theyre not supposed to be a set for The Last of the Mohicans You know one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town between the urban and the rural Theyre not the same thing And were not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time Here you see it on a small scale  the mothership has landed RD and CPO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet Laughter A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city city life and everything connected with it And so what you see fairly early in the midth century is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city which is going to be life in the country for everybody And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb the country villa along the railroad line which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city but to return to the countryside every night And believe me there were no WalMarts or convenience stores out there then so it really was a form of country living But what happens is of course it mutates over the next  years and it turns into something rather insidious It becomes a cartoon of a country house in a cartoon of the country And thats the great nonarticulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule Because it hasnt delivered what its been promising for half a century now And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there you know Basically a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state emphatically Im a little cabin in the woods Theres nothing on either side of me I dont have any eyes on the side of my head I cant see So you have this one last facade of the house the front which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house Because  notice the porch here Unless the people that live here are Munchkins nobodys going to be using that This is really in fact a television broadcasting a show  called Were Normal Were normal were normal were normal were normal were normal Please respect us were normal were normal were normal But we know whats going on in these houses you know We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here getting ready for homeroom Laughter We know that Heather his sister Heather  years old is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit Because these places these habitats are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children and they dont have a lot of experience with medication So they take the first one that comes along often These are not good enough for Americans These are the schools we are sending them to The Hannibal Lecter Central School Las Vegas Nevada This is a real school You know but theres obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver So every effort is made to keep them within the building Notice that nature is present Laughter Were going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not We are entering an epochal period of change in the world and  certainly in America  the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era It is going to change absolutely everything Chris asked me not to go on too long about this and I wont except to say theres not going to be a hydrogen economy Forget it Its not going to happen Were going to have to do something else instead Were going to have to downscale rescale and resize virtually everything we do in this country and we cant start soon enough to do it Were going to have  Applause  were going to have to live closer to where we work Were going to have to live closer to each other Were going have to grow more food closer to where we live The age of the  mile Caesar salad is coming to an end Were going to have to  we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of We gotta do better than that And we should have started two days before yesterday We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there for the last  years excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents generation after World War II Because were going to need it if were going to learn how to reconstruct towns Were going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to relearn how to compose meaningful places places that are integral that allow  that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life deployed in an integral fashion So that you know the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business of culture and of governance Were going to have to relearn what the building blocks of these things are the street the block how to compose public space thats both large and small the courtyard the civic square and how to really make use of this property We can see some of the first ideas for retrofitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America The dead malls what are we going to do with them Well in point of fact most of them are not going to make it Theyre not going to be retrofitted theyre going to be the salvage yards of the future Some of them were going to fix though And were going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development And if were lucky the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities And by the way our towns and cities are where they are and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites And most of them are still going to be there although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished Weve got a lot of work to do Were not going to be rescued by the hypercar were not going to be rescued by alternative fuels No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what were running the way were running it Were going to have to do everything very differently And Americas not prepared We are sleepwalking into the future Were not ready for whats coming at us So I urge you all to do what you can Life in the midst century is going to be about living locally Be prepared to be good neighbors Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens One final thing  Ive been very disturbed about this for years but I think its particularly important for this audience Please please stop referring to yourselves as consumers OK Consumers are different than citizens Consumers do not have obligations responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings And as long as youre using that word consumer in the public discussion you will be degrading the quality of the discussion were having And were going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face So thank you very much Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending Applause ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

122,Theres a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year and Im pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you I didnt attend the first TED back in  but Ive been to a lot of them since that time I thought it would kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started Thank you very much Richard its been a big enjoyable part of my life coming here And so thinking back I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects  certainly technological objects And so it was great fun in those days and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients Wed come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and wed put it on the conference table and wed pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and ah That was a really good time And so well continue to focus on products as we always have And if you were here last year I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule  which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring And I took a lot of pictures last year very few people knew what I was up to but I took a lot of pictures This year  maybe you could show the slides  this year were carrying this Treo which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it Also though we designed it a few years ago  its just become ubiquitous in the last year or so  this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives Maybe youve seen them in the airports They seem to be everywhere now Lots of lives are being saved by those And were just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read So we really will continue to focus on products But somethings happened in the last  years since Richard started TED and thats that people like us  I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time but for us weve really just started  weve kind of climbed Maslows hierarchy a little bit  and so were now focused more and more on humancentered design humancenteredness in an approach to design That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products And I think youre starting to see that and its making our job even more enjoyable Interestingly enough we used to primarily build D models  you know youve seen some today  and D renderings Then wed go and wed show those as communicating our ideas But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that were designing and get them in motion showing how theyll be used And so in order to do that weve been forming internal videoproduction groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the manmachine relationship And its a much better way to see Its kind of like architects who show people in their houses as opposed to them being empty So I thought that I would show you a few videos to show off this new broader definition of design in products and services and environments I have a few of them  theyre no more than a minute or a minuteandahalf apiece  but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year and how it responds in video So Prada New York we were asked by Rem Koolhaas and OMA to help us conceive the technology thats in their retail store in New York He wanted a new kind of store  a new one  a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use So therere lots of things Everything has RF tags theres RF tags on the user on the cards theres the staff devices that are all around the store You pick them up and once you see something that youre interested in the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store You can look at color and sizes and how it appeared on the runway or whatever And so then the object  the merchandise that youre interested in  can be scanned Its taken into the dressing room and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that and get more information about the clothing that youre interested in as youre trying it on Its been used a lot of places but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal displays in the changing room The last time I went to see this store there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here But if you push the button of course the whole wall goes dark So you can try to get approval or not for whatever youre wearing And then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror where you put on the clothes Theres a big display in the mirror and you can turn around  but theres a three second delay So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around as you look About a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum  this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London and its primarily about digital and biomedical issues And a group at Itch which is now part of IDEO designed this interactive wall thats about four stories tall I dont know if anybodys seen this  its pretty spectacular in the room Anyway its based on the London subway system And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving and get it up on the wall so everybody could see Just for everybody to see So you enter your information Then like the London tube system the little trains go around with what youre thinking about And then when you get to a station its expanded so that you can actually read it Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor  mostly teenagers coming out of there  theres this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun also designed by Durrell Bishop and Andrew Hirniak of Itch And the topics include things that the museum is about male fertility choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like Theres lots of room so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved And also its not shown in the video but these are very beautiful They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top after theyve bounced around they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere The next video is not done by us This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldnt help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldnt pass it up Hes always been interested in technology in the future Video Scott Adams I realized that at some point I might be the worlds expert on whats wrong with cubicles So we thought well wouldnt it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better Narrator Though they work in a wideopen office space spectacularly set under San Franciscos Oakland Bay Bridge the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems Woman A oneway mirror I can look out you can look at yourself Narrator They took pictures Woman You feel so trapped when someone kind of leans over and youre sort of held captive there for a minute SA So far its chaos but a lot of people are doing stuff so thats good Well see what happens Narrator The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos In the second groups scenario the walls are alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human David Kelley So heres the final thing complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across  that follows the tracks of the sun  across the sky So you feel that in your cubicle And my favorite feature which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment and then when you come back it comes up to greet you happy to see you SA The storage is built right into the wall DK You know it has homey touches like a builtin fish tank in the walls or something to be aggressive with to release tension SA Customizable for the boss of your choice DK And of course a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle SA Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this DK This next project we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it as well as wastewater So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time The pavilions design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful In contrast to if you went inside the dome where its kind of wild and crazy and everybodys learning all kinds of things or fooling around or whatever theyre doing But it was intended to be quite quiet And then you would wander around and gather information in a straightforward fashion about the recycling process and whats being done and how theyre going to reuse the water once it comes through the plant And then if you saw the panels actually rotate So you can get the information on the front side but as they rotate you can see the actual recycling plant behind with all the machines as they actually process the water You can see theres the plant These are all very lowbudget videos like quick prototypes And were announcing a new product here tonight which is the first time this has ever been shown in public Its called Spyfish and its a company called HEye started by Nigel Jagger in London And its a company thats trying to bring the experience  many people have boats or enjoy being on boats but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing whats there and enjoying what scuba divers do This product it has two cameras You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet For us  theres the object  for us it was two projects One to design the interface so that the interface doesnt get in your way You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater  of feeling like youre underwater  seeing whats going on And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool And so we spent a lot of time  this has been going on for about seven or eight years this project  and were just ready to start building them Narrator The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera It can dive to  feet to where sunlight does not penetrate and is equipped with powerful lights It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep The batterypowered Spyfish sends the live videofeed through a slender cable DK This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is Narrator And this central box connects the whole system together Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control You watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater DK And the last thing Ill talk about is ApproTEC which is a project that Im very excited about ApproTEC is a company started by Dr Martin Fisher whos a good friend of mine Hes a PhD from Stanford He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright and he had a very interesting insight which is that he said There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya there must be entrepreneurs everywhere And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya with Kenyan manufacturers  designed by people like us but taken there And to this date  hes been gone for only a few years  hes started  companies Hes made  new jobs And just the sales of the products  this is a nonprofit  the sales of these products is now  of the GDP of Kenya This is one guy doing this This is a pretty spectacular thing So were in the process of helping them design deepwell lowcost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the offseason What they do now is they can grow crops in the rainy season but they cant grow them in the offseason And so by doing that the woman that you saw in the first thing  shes a school teacher  always wanted to send her kids to college and shes going to be able to do it because of these things So with seedsqueezers and pumps and haybalers and very straightforward things that were designing  my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work  its really amazing to see his success Martins We also were thinking about the experience of Richard and so   we designed this hat because I knew Id be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him So I just have one more thing to say Can you read it Well its always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers You know you dont want to be rude to him and you dont want to feel guilty and so I thought this would do it where I just sit here So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session and from all the different presenters And in my own practice from product to ApproTEC its really exciting that were taking a more humancentered approach to design that were including behaviors and personalities in the things we do and I think this is great Designers are more trusted and more integrated into the business strategy of companies and I have to say for one I feel very lucky at the progress that design has made since the first TED Thanks a lot ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

123,Basically theres a major demographic event going on And it may be that passing the  percent urban point is an economic tipping point So the world now is a map of connectivity It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities What we have now is the end of the rise of the West Thats over The aggregate numbers are overwhelming So whats really going on Well villages of the world are emptying out The question is why And heres the unromantic truth  and the city air makes you free they said in Renaissance Germany So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty Theyre people getting out of poverty as fast as they can Theyre the dominant builders and to a large extent the dominant designers They have homebrewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life Onesixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai They are constantly upgrading and in a few cases the government helps Education is the main event that can happen in cities Whats going on in the street in Mumbai Al Gore knows Its basically everything Theres no unemployment in squatter cities Everyone works Onesixth of humanity is there Its soon going to be more than that So heres the first punch line cities have defused the population bomb And heres the second punch line Thats the news from downtown Here it is in perspective Stars have shined down on earths life for billions of years Now were shining right back up Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

125,"I do two things I design mobile computers
and I study brains Todays talk is about brains
and  Audience member cheers Yay I have a brain fan out there If I could have my first slide youll see the title of my talk
and my two affiliations So what Im going to talk about is why
we dont have a good brain theory why it is important
that we should develop one and what we can do about it Ill try to do all that in  minutes I have two affiliations Most of you know me
from my Palm and Handspring days but I also run a nonprofit
scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience
Institute in Menlo Park We study theoretical neuroscience
and how the neocortex works Im going to talk all about that I have one slide on my other life
the computer life and thats this slide here These are some of the products
Ive worked on over the last  years starting from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on ending up
most recently with the Treo and were continuing to do this Ive done this because
I believe mobile computing is the future of personal computing and Im trying to make
the world a little bit better by working on these things But this was I admit all an accident I really didnt want to do
any of these products Very early in my career I decided I was not going to be
in the computer industry Before that I just have to tell you about this picture of Graffiti
I picked off the web the other day I was looking for a picture for Graffiti
thatll text input language I found a website dedicated to teachers
who want to make scriptwriting things across the top of their blackboard and they had added Graffiti to it
and Im sorry about that So what happened was when I was young and got out
of engineering school at Cornell in  I went to work for Intel
and was in the computer industry and three months into that
I fell in love with something else I said I made
the wrong career choice here and I fell in love with brains This is not a real brain This is a picture of one a line drawing And I dont remember
exactly how it happened but I have one recollection
which was pretty strong in my mind In September of  Scientific American came out
with a singletopic issue about the brain It was one of their best issues ever They talked about the neuron
development disease vision and all the things you might want
to know about brains It was really quite impressive One mightve had the impression
we knew a lot about brains But the last article in that issue
was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame Today is I think the th anniversary
of the discovery of DNA And he wrote a story basically saying
this is all well and good but you know we dont know
diddly squat about brains and no one has a clue how they work so dont believe what anyone tells you This is a quote
from that article he says What is conspicuously lacking 
hes a very proper British gentleman  What is conspicuously lacking
is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret
these different approaches I thought the word framework was great He didnt say we didnt have a theory He says we dont even know
how to begin to think about it We dont even have a framework We are in the preparadigm days
if you want to use Thomas Kuhn So I fell in love with this I said look We have all this knowledge
about brains  how hard can it be Its something we can work on
in my lifetime I could make a difference So I tried to get out of the computer
business into the brain business First I went to MIT
the AI lab was there I said I want to build
intelligent machines too but I want to study how brains work first And they said Oh you
dont need to do that Youre just going to program
computers thats all I said you really ought to study brains They said No youre wrong I said No youre wrong
and I didnt get in I was a little disappointed 
pretty young  but I went back again a few years later this time in California
and I went to Berkeley And I said Ill go
in from the biological side So I got in the PhD program in biophysics I was like Im studying brains now
Well I want to study theory They said You cant
study theory about brains You cant get funded for that And as a graduate student
you cant do that So I said oh my gosh I was depressed I said but I can
make a difference in this field I went back in the computer industry and said Ill have to work
here for a while Thats when I designed
all those computer products I said I want to do this
for four years make some money I was having a family
and I would mature a bit and maybe the business
of neuroscience would mature a bit Well it took longer than four years
Its been about  years But Im doing it now
and Im going to tell you about it So why should we have a good brain theory Well theres lots of reasons
people do science The most basic one is
people like to know things Were curious and we go out
and get knowledge Why do we study ants Its interesting Maybe well learn something useful
but its interesting and fascinating But sometimes a science
has other attributes which makes it really interesting Sometimes a science will tell
something about ourselves itll tell us who we are Evolution did this
and Copernicus did this where we have a new
understanding of who we are And after all we are our brains
My brain is talking to your brain Our bodies are hanging along for the ride but my brain is talking to your brain And if we want to understand
who we are and how we feel and perceive we need to understand brains Another thing is sometimes science leads
to big societal benefits technologies or businesses or whatever This is one too because
when we understand how brains work well be able to build
intelligent machines Thats a good thing on the whole with tremendous benefits to society just like a fundamental technology So why dont we have
a good theory of brains People have been working
on it for  years Lets first take a look
at what normal science looks like This is normal science Normal science is a nice balance
between theory and experimentalists The theorist guy says
I think this is whats going on the experimentalist says Youre wrong It goes back and forth
this works in physics this in geology But if this is normal science
what does neuroscience look like This is what neuroscience looks like We have this mountain of data which is anatomy physiology and behavior You cant imagine how much detail
we know about brains There were  people who went
to the neuroscience conference this year and every one of them
is doing research in brains A lot of data but no theory Theres a little wimpy box on top there And theory has not played a role
in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences And its a real shame Now why has this come about If you ask neuroscientists
why is this the state of affairs first theyll admit it But if you ask them they say theres various reasons
we dont have a good brain theory Some say we still dont have enough data we need more information
theres all these things we dont know Well I just told you theres data
coming out of your ears We have so much information
we dont even know how to organize it What good is more going to do Maybe well be lucky and discover
some magic thing but I dont think so This is a symptom of the fact
that we just dont have a theory We dont need more data
we need a good theory Another one is sometimes people say Brains are so complex
itll take another  years I even think Chris said something
like this yesterday something like its one of the most complicated
things in the universe Thats not true  youre more
complicated than your brain Youve got a brain And although the brain
looks very complicated things look complicated
until you understand them Thats always been the case So we can say my neocortex
the part of the brain Im interested in has  billion cells But you know what
Its very very regular In fact it looks like its the same thing
repeated over and over again Its not as complex as it looks
Thats not the issue Some people say
brains cant understand brains Very Zenlike Woo You know it sounds good but why
I mean whats the point Its just a bunch of cells
You understand your liver Its got a lot of cells in it too right So you know I dont think
theres anything to that And finally some people say I dont feel like a bunch
of cells  Im conscious Ive got this experience
Im in the world I cant be just a bunch of cells Well people used to believe
there was a life force to be living and we now know
thats really not true at all And theres really no evidence other than that people just disbelieve
that cells can do what they do So some people have fallen
into the pit of metaphysical dualism some really smart people too
but we can reject all that No theres something else something really fundamental and it is another reason why we dont have
a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive
strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us
from seeing the answer Theres something we believe that just
its obvious but its wrong Now theres a history of this in science
and before I tell you what it is Ill tell you about the history
of it in science Look at other scientific revolutions  the solar system thats Copernicus Darwins evolution
and tectonic plates thats Wegener They all have a lot in common
with brain science First they had a lot
of unexplained data A lot of it But it got more manageable
once they had a theory The best minds were stumped 
really smart people Were not smarter now than they were then it just turns out its really
hard to think of things but once youve thought of them
its easy to understand My daughters understood
these three theories in their basic framework in kindergarten Its not that hard 
heres the apple heres the orange the Earth goes around that kind of stuff Another thing is the answer
was there all along but we kind of ignored it
because of this obvious thing It was an intuitive
strongly held belief that was wrong In the case of the solar system the idea that the Earth is spinning the surface is going
a thousand miles an hour and its going through the solar system
at a million miles an hour  this is lunacy we all know
the Earth isnt moving Do you feel like youre moving
a thousand miles an hour If you said Earth was spinning
around in space and was huge  they would lock you up
thats what they did back then So it was intuitive and obvious
Now what about evolution Evolution same thing We taught our kids the Bible says
God created all these species cats are cats dogs are dogs
people are people plants are plants they dont change Noah put them on the ark
in that order blah blah The fact is if you believe in evolution
we all have a common ancestor We all have a common ancestor
with the plant in the lobby This is what evolution tells us
And its true Its kind of unbelievable And the same thing about tectonic plates All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around
on top of the Earth It doesnt make any sense So what is the intuitive
but incorrect assumption thats kept us from understanding brains Ill tell you Itll seem obvious
that its correct Thats the point Then Ill make an argument why
youre incorrect on the other assumption The intuitive but obvious thing is somehow intelligence
is defined by behavior were intelligent
because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently And Im going to tell you thats wrong Intelligence is defined by prediction Im going to work you
through this in a few slides and give you an example
of what this means Heres a system Engineers and scientists
like to look at systems like this They say we have a thing in a box
We have its inputs and outputs The AI people said the thing in the box
is a programmable computer because its equivalent to a brain Well feed it some inputs and get it
to do something have some behavior Alan Turing defined the Turing test
which essentially says well know if somethings intelligent
if it behaves identical to a human  a behavioral metric
of what intelligence is that has stuck in our minds
for a long time Reality though 
I call it real intelligence Real intelligence
is built on something else We experience the world
through a sequence of patterns and we store them and we recall them When we recall them
we match them up against reality and were making predictions all the time Its an internal metric
theres an internal metric about us saying do we understand the world
am I making predictions and so on Youre all being intelligent now
but youre not doing anything Maybe youre scratching yourself
but youre not doing anything But youre being intelligent
youre understanding what Im saying Because youre intelligent
and you speak English you know the word at the end of this sentence The word came to you
you make these predictions all the time What Im saying is the internal prediction
is the output in the neocortex and somehow prediction
leads to intelligent behavior Heres how that happens Lets start with a nonintelligent brain Ill argue a nonintelligent brain
well call it an old brain And well say its
a nonmammal like a reptile say an alligator we have an alligator And the alligator has
some very sophisticated senses Its got good eyes and ears
and touch senses and so on a mouth and a nose It has very complex behavior It can run and hide It has fears
and emotions It can eat you It can attack
It can do all kinds of stuff But we dont consider
the alligator very intelligent not in a human sort of way But it has all this complex
behavior already Now in evolution what happened First thing that happened
in evolution with mammals is we started to develop a thing
called the neocortex Im going to represent the neocortex
by this box on top of the old brain Neocortex means new layer
Its a new layer on top of your brain Its the wrinkly thing
on the top of your head that got wrinkly because it got shoved
in there and doesnt fit Literally its about the size
of a table napkin and doesnt fit so its wrinkly Now look at how Ive drawn this The old brain is still there You still have that alligator brain
You do Its your emotional brain Its all those gut reactions you have On top of it we have this memory system
called the neocortex And the memory system is sitting
over the sensory part of the brain So as the sensory input
comes in and feeds from the old brain it also goes up into the neocortex And the neocortex is just memorizing Its sitting there saying Im going
to memorize all the things going on where Ive been people Ive seen
things Ive heard and so on And in the future when it sees
something similar to that again in a similar environment
or the exact same environment itll start playing it back
Oh Ive been here before and when you were here before
this happened next It allows you to predict the future It literally feeds back
the signals into your brain theyll let you see
whats going to happen next will let you hear the word
sentence before I said it And its this feeding
back into the old brain that will allow you to make
more intelligent decisions This is the most important slide
of my talk so Ill dwell on it a little And all the time you say
Oh I can predict things so if youre a rat and you go
through a maze and you learn the maze next time youre in one
you have the same behavior But suddenly youre smarter
you say I recognize this maze I know which way to go Ive been here
before I can envision the future Thats what its doing This is true for all mammals  in humans it got a lot worse Humans actually developed
the front of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex And nature did a little trick It copied the posterior
the back part which is sensory and put it in the front Humans uniquely have
the same mechanism on the front but we use it for motor control So were now able to do very sophisticated
motor planning things like that I dont have time to explain
but to understand how a brain works you have to understand how the first part
of the mammalian neocortex works how it is we store patterns
and make predictions Let me give you
a few examples of predictions I already said the word sentence In music if youve heard a song before when you hear it the next note
pops into your head already  you anticipate it With an album at the end of a song
the next song pops into your head It happens all the time
you make predictions I have this thing called
the altered door thought experiment It says you have a door at home when youre here Im changing it  Ive got a guy back at your house
right now moving the door around moving your doorknob over two inches When you go home tonight youll put
your hand out reach for the doorknob notice its in the wrong spot and go Whoa something happened It may take a second
but something happened I can change your doorknob
in other ways  make it larger smaller change
its brass to silver make it a lever I can change the door
put colors on put windows in I can change a thousand things
about your door and in the two seconds
you take to open it youll notice something has changed Now the engineering approach
the AI approach to this is to build a door database
with all the door attributes And as you go up to the door
we check them off one at time door door color  We dont do that
Your brain doesnt do that Your brain is making
constant predictions all the time about what will happen
in your environment As I put my hand on this table
I expect to feel it stop When I walk every step
if I missed it by an eighth of an inch Ill know something has changed Youre constantly making predictions
about your environment Ill talk about vision briefly This is a picture of a woman When we look at people our eyes saccade
over two to three times a second Were not aware of it
but our eyes are always moving When we look at a face we typically
go from eye to eye to nose to mouth When your eye moves from eye to eye if there was something
else there like a nose youd see a nose where an eye
is supposed to be and go Oh shit Theres something wrong
about this person Thats because youre making a prediction Its not like you just look over and say
What am I seeing A nose OK No you have an expectation
of what youre going to see Every single moment And finally lets think
about how we test intelligence We test it by prediction
What is the next word in this  This is to this as this is to this
What is the next number in this sentence Heres three visions of an object
Whats the fourth one Thats how we test it
Its all about prediction So what is the recipe for brain theory First of all we have to have
the right framework And the framework is a memory framework not a computational or behavior framework its a memory framework How do you store and recall
these sequences of patterns Its spatiotemporal patterns Then if in that framework
you take a bunch of theoreticians  biologists generally
are not good theoreticians Not always but generally theres not
a good history of theory in biology Ive found the best people
to work with are physicists engineers and mathematicians who tend to think algorithmically Then they have to learn
the anatomy and the physiology You have to make these theories
very realistic in anatomical terms Anyone who tells you their theory
about how the brain works and doesnt tell you exactly
how its working and how the wiring works  its not a theory And thats what we do
at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute Id love to tell you were making
fantastic progress in this thing and I expect to be back on this stage
sometime in the not too distant future to tell you about it Im really excited
this is not going to take  years What will brain theory look like First of all its going
to be about memory Not like computer memory 
not at all like computer memory Its very different Its a memory of very
highdimensional patterns like the things that come from your eyes Its also memory of sequences you cannot learn or recall anything
outside of a sequence A song must be heard
in sequence over time and you must play it back
in sequence over time And these sequences
are autoassociatively recalled so if I see something I hear something
it reminds me of it and it plays back automatically Its an automatic playback And prediction of future inputs
is the desired output And as I said the theory
must be biologically accurate it must be testable
and you must be able to build it If you dont build it
you dont understand it One more slide What is this going to result in Are we going to really build
intelligent machines Absolutely And its going to be
different than people think No doubt that its going
to happen in my mind First of all were going to build
this stuff out of silicon The same techniques we use to build
silicon computer memories we can use here But theyre very different
types of memories And well attach
these memories to sensors and the sensors will experience
reallive realworld data and learn about their environment Now its very unlikely the first things
youll see are like robots Not that robots arent useful
people can build robots But the robotics part is the hardest part
Thats old brain Thats really hard The new brain is easier
than the old brain So first well do things
that dont require a lot of robotics So youre not going to see CPO Youre going to see things
more like intelligent cars that really understand
what traffic is what driving is and have learned that cars
with the blinkers on for half a minute probably arent going to turn We can also do intelligent
security systems Anytime were basically using our brain
but not doing a lot of mechanics  those are the things
that will happen first But ultimately the worlds the limit I dont know how this will turn out I know a lot of people who invented
the microprocessor And if you talk to them they knew what they were doing
was really significant but they didnt really know
what was going to happen They couldnt anticipate
cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff They just knew like
Were going to build calculators and trafficlight controllers But its going to be big In the same way brain science
and these memories are going to be a very
fundamental technology and it will lead to unbelievable changes
in the next  years And Im most excited about
how were going to use them in science So I think thats all my time  Im over and Im going to end my talk right there ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

126,Id like to start tonight by something completely different asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment  percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean and its where life  the title of our seminar tonight  its where life began And its a lively and a lovely place but were rapidly changing the oceans with our  not only with our overfishing our irresponsible fishing our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland but also most recently with climate change and Steve Schneider Im sure will be going into greater detail on this Now as we continue to tinker with the oceans more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that were creating will be conducive to lowenergy type of animals like jellyfish and bacteria And this might be the kind of seas were headed for Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful and youll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday but they sting like hell and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up About  grams of jellyfish equals four calories So it may be good for the waistline but it probably wont keep you satiated for very long And a sea thats just filled and teeming with jellyfish isnt very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans that is unless you eat jellyfish And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there a bythewind sailor And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish the Mola mola whose primary prey are jellyfish This animal is in The Guinness World Book of Records for being the worlds heaviest bony fish It reaches up to almost  pounds  on a diet of jellyfish primarily And I think its kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola  its common name is sunfish  that its favorite food is the moon jelly So its kind of nice the sun and the moon getting together this way even if one is eating the other Now this is typically how you see sunfish this is where they get their common name They like to sunbathe cant blame them They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think theyre sick or lazy but thats a typical behavior they lie out and bask on the surface Their other name Mola mola is  it sounds Hawaiian but its actually Latin for millstone and thats attributable to their roundish very bizarre cutoff shape Its as if as they were growing they just forgot the tail part And thats actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place was this terribly bizarre shape You know you look at sharks and theyre streamlined and theyre sleek and you look at tuna and theyre like torpedoes  they just give away their agenda Theyre about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish And this is just so elegantly mysterious its just  it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say a tuna So I was just intrigued with what  you know what is this animals story Well as with anything in biology nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution The Molas no exception They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared  million years ago at a time when whales still had legs and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction  oblige me a little Kiplingesque storytelling here Of course evolution is somewhat random and you know about  million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said oh the heck with the coral reefs  were going to head to the high seas And lots of generations lots of tweaking and torquing and we turn our puffer into the Mola You know if you give Mother Nature enough time that is what she will produce They look  maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished abridged perhaps but in fact in fact they are the  they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarilyderived fish in the sea right up there with flat fish Theyre  every single thing about that fish has been changed And in terms of fishes  fishes appeared  million years ago and theyre pretty modern just  million years ago so  so interestingly they give away their ancestry as they develop They start as little eggs and theyre in The Guinness World Book of Records again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet A single fourfoot female had  million eggs can carry  million eggs in her ovaries  imagine  and they get to be over  feet long Imagine what a  foot one has And from that little egg they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage reminiscent of their ancestry and develop  this is their little adolescent stage They school as adolescents and become behemoth loners as adults Thats a little diver up there in the corner Theyre in The Guinness World Book of Records again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world From their little hatching size of their egg into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood they put on  million times an increase in weight  million Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby and you had to feed this thing That would mean that your child you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics Now I dont know how youd feed a child like that but  we dont know how fast the Molas grow in the wild but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium  one of the first places to have them in captivity  they had one that gained  lbs in  months I said now thats a true American So being a loner is a great thing especially in todays seas because schooling used to be salvation for fishes but its suicide for fishes now But unfortunately Molas even though they dont school they still get caught in nets as bycatch If were going to save the world from total jellyfish domination then weve got to figure out what the jellyfish predators  how they live their lives like the Mola And unfortunately they make up a large portion of the California bycatch  up to  percent of the drift net And in the Mediterranean in the swordfish net fisheries they make up up to  percent So weve got to figure out how theyre living their lives And how do you do that How do you do that with an animal  very few places in the world This is an open ocean creature It knows no boundaries  it doesnt go to land How do you get insight How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets Well theres some great new technology that has just recently become available and its just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals And its pictured right here that little tag up there That little tag can record temperature depth and light intensity which is correlated with time and from that we can get locations And it can record this data for up to two years and keep it in that tag release at a preprogrammed time float to the surface upload all that data that whole travelogue to satellite which relays it directly to our computers and weve got that whole dataset And we didnt even have  we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know sat at our desks So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them  if you look up here  thats streaming off thats right where we put the tag And it just so happens thats a parasite hanging off the Mola Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites Theyre just parasite hotels even their parasites have parasites I think Donne wrote a poem about that But they have  genera of parasites and so we figured just one more parasite wont be too much of a problem And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment They dont seem to mind so far So what are we trying to find out Were focusing on the Pacific Were tagging on the California coast and were tagging over in Taiwan and Japan And were interested in how these animals are using the currents using temperature using the open ocean to live their lives Wed love to tag in Monterey Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers Not this time of year  its more around October And wed love to tag here  this is an aerial shot of Monterey  but unfortunately the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay rips off their fins fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee Mola style and then tosses them back and forth And Im not exaggerating it is just  and sometimes they dont eat them its just spiteful And you know the locals think its terrible behavior its just horrible watching this happen day after day The poor little Molas coming in getting ripped to shreds so we head down south to San Diego Not so many California sea lions down there And the Molas there you can find them with a spotter plane very easily and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp And under those kelps  this is why the Molas come there because its spa time for the Molas there As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp the exfoliating cleaner fish come And they come and give the Molas  you can see they strike this funny little position that says Im not threatening but I need a massage And theyll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean  because the Molas you know theres just a smorgasbord of parasites And its also a great place to go down south because the waters warmer and the Molas are kind of friendly down there I mean what other kind of fish if you approach it right will say Okay scratch me right there You truly can swim up to a Mola  theyre very gentle  and if you approach them right you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it So weve also tagged one part of the Pacific weve gone over to another part of the Pacific and weve tagged in Taiwan and we tagged in Japan And over in these places the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries And theyre not thrown back as bycatch theyre eaten We were served a ninecourse meal of Mola after we tagged Well not the one we tagged And everything from the kidney to the testes to the back bone to the fin muscle to  I think that �s pretty much the whole fish  is eaten So the hardest part of tagging now is after you put that tag on you have to wait months And youre just wondering oh I hope the fish is safe I hope I hope its going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording The tags cost  dollars each and then satellite time is another  dollars so youre like oh I hope the tag is okay And so the waiting is really the hardest part Im going to show you our latest dataset And it hasnt been published so its totally privy information just for TED And in showing you this you know when were looking at this data were thinking oh do these animals do they cross the equator Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other And we found that they kind of are homebodies Theyre not big migrators This is their track we deployed the tag off of Tokyo and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there And after four months went up you know off of the north part of Japan And thats kind of their home range Now thats important though because if theres a lot of fishing pressure that population doesnt get replenished So thats a very important piece of data But also whats important is that theyre not slacker lazy fish Theyre super industrious And this is a day in the life of a Mola and if we  theyre up and down and up and down and up and down and up and up and down up to  times a day As the sun comes up you see in the blue they start their dive Down  and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper little deeper They plumb the depths down to  meters in temperatures to one degree centigrade and this is why you see them on the surface  its so cold down there Theyve got to come up warm get that solar power and then plunge back into the depths and go up and down and up and down And theyre hitting a layer down there its called the deep scattering layer  which a whole variety of foods in that layer So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker theyre really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature We see the same pattern  now with these tags were seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes manta rays tunas a real threedimensional play This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life where theyre going to be tagging all over the world and the Molas going to enter into that And whats exciting  you all travel and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge Well now with the Census of Marine Life well be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore  percent of our living space with local knowledge Its never  its really never been a more exciting or a vital time to be a biologist Which brings me to my last point and what I think is kind of the most fun I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish And so I just figured Id have the questions answered and Id be able to thank my funders like National Geographic and Lindbergh But people would write into the site with all sorts of all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared  a shared love and an interest in the oceans I was getting reports from Catholic nuns Jewish Rabbis Muslims Christians  everybody writing in united by their love of life And to me that  I dont think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself One touch of nature makes the whole world kin And sure it may be just one big old silly fish but its helping If its helping to unite the world I think its definitely the fish of the future ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

127,Thank you very much Chris Everybody who came up here said they were scared I dont know if Im scared but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this And I dont have any smart technology for you to look at There are no slides so youll just have to be content with me What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time the Africa of HIVAIDS the Africa of malaria the Africa of poverty the Africa of conflict and the Africa of disasters While it is true that those things are going on theres an Africa that you dont hear about very much And sometimes Im puzzled and I ask myself why This is the Africa that is changing that Chris alluded to This is the Africa of opportunity This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this Thats what I want to talk about today And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa On th of September  Mr Diepreye Alamieyeseigha a governor of one of the oilrich states of Nigeria was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria  led by one of our most able and courageous people Mr Nuhu Ribadu Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London Due to some slipups he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where according to our constitution those in office as governors president  as in many countries  have immunity and cannot be prosecuted But what happened people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office Today Alams  as we call him for short  is in jail This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good and not taken out to places where theyll benefit just a few of the elite And therefore when you hear about the corrupt Africa  corruption all the time  I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries and that some successes are emerging Does it mean the problem is over The answer is no Theres still a long way to go but that theres a will there And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight So when you hear about corruption dont just feel that nothing is being done about this  that you cant operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption That is not the case Theres a will to fight and in many countries that fight is ongoing and is being won In others like mine where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go But the truth of the matter is that this is going on The results are showing independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption and governance is improving A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in  African countries And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance That is that people talk about corruption corruption All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa Thats the image African countries But let me say this if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London  if the other people who had taken money estimated at  to  billion now of developing countries monies sitting abroad in the developed countries  if theyre able to do this what is that Is that not corruption In this country if you receive stolen goods are you not prosecuted So when we talk about this kind of corruption let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe  where the moneys going and what can be done to stop it Im working on an initiative now along with the World Bank on asset recovery trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad  developing countries moneys  to get that sent back Because if we can get the  billion dollars sitting out there back it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform Africans after  theyre tired were tired of being the subject of everybodys charity and care We are grateful but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us We have to do it We can invite partners who can support us but we have to start We have to reform our economies change our leadership become more democratic be more open to change and to information And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent Nigeria In fact if youre not in Nigeria youre not in Africa I want to tell you that One in four subSaharan Africans is Nigerian and it has  million dynamic people  chaotic people  but very interesting people Youll never be bored What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves And with the support of a leader who was willing at the time to do the reforms we put forward a comprehensive reform program which we developed ourselves Not the International Monetary Fund Not the World Bank where I worked for  years and rose to be a vice president No one can do it for you You have to do it for yourself We put together a program that would one get the state out of businesses it had nothing  it had no business being in The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because its inefficient and incompetent So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises We  as a result we decided to liberalize many of our markets Can you believe that prior to this reform  which started at the end of  when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister  we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop  landlines in its entire year history Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury You couldnt get it You had to bribe You had to do everything to get your phone When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector we went from  landlines to  million GSM lines and counting Nigerias telecoms market is the secondfastest growing in the world after China We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms And nobody knows except a few smart people The smartest one first to come in was the MTN company of South Africa And in the three years that I was Finance Minister they made an average of  million dollars profit per year  million in a market  in a country that is a poor country with an average per capita income just under  dollars per capita So the market is there When they kept this under wraps but soon others got to know Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies and three or four others have come in But theres a huge market out there and people dont know about it or they dont want to know So privatization is one of the things weve done The other thing weve also done is to manage our finances better Because nobodys going to help you and support you if youre not managing your own finances well And Nigeria with the oil sector had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well So what did we try to do We introduced a fiscal rule that delinked our budget from the oil price Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in because oil is the biggest most revenueearning sector in the economy  percent of our revenues come from oil We delinked that and once we did it we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price We didnt know we could pull it off it was very controversial But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development  where even if oil prices were high we would grow very fast When they crashed we crashed And we could hardly even pay anything any salaries in the economy That smoothened out We were able to save just before I left  billion dollars Whereas  and this went to our reserves  when I arrived in  we had seven billion dollars in reserves By the time I left we had gone up to almost  billion dollars And as we speak now we have about  billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances And that shores up our economy makes it stable Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy We brought inflation down from  percent to about  percent And we had GDP grow from an average of  percent the previous decade to about  percent now So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy And what is more important because we want to get away from oil and diversify  and there are so many opportunities in this one big country as in many countries in Africa  what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone but from nonoil Agriculture grew at better than eight percent As telecoms sector grew housing and construction and I could go on and on And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macroeconomy straightened out the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous We have opportunities in agriculture like I said We have opportunities in solid minerals We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible that wouldnt happen So weve now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world We have opportunities in housing and real estate There was nothing in a country of  million people  no shopping malls as you know them here This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people And now we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected So huge things in construction real estate mortgage markets Financial services we had  banks Too many not doing their real business We consolidated them from  to  banks by requiring that they increase their capital  share capital And it went from about  million dollars to  million dollars The banks  these banks are now consolidated and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside Barclays Bank of the UK is bringing in  million Standard Chartered has brought in  million And I can go on Dollars on and on into the system We are doing the same with the insurance sector So in financial services a great deal of opportunity In tourism in many African countries a great opportunity And thats what many people know East Africa for the wildlife the elephants and so on But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important So what am I trying to say Im trying to tell you that theres a new wave on the continent A new wave of openness and democratization in which since  more than twothirds of African countries have had multiparty democratic elections Not all of them have been perfect or will be but the trend is very clear Im trying to tell you that since the past three years the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about  percent to about five percent per annum This is better than the performance of many OECD countries So its clear that things are changing Conflicts are down on the continent from about  conflicts a decade ago we are down to three or four conflicts  one of the most terrible of course of which is Darfur And you know you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent it looks like the entire continent is affected But you should know that this continent is not  is a continent of many countries not one country And if we are down to three or four conflicts it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable growing exciting economies where theres plenty of opportunity And I want to just make one point about this investment The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs Theres no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving childrens lives Thats not what Im saying That is fine But imagine the impact on a family if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet isnt that a wonderful opportunity Isnt that the way to go And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women I have a CD here Im sorry that I didnt say anything on time Otherwise I would have liked you to have seen this It says Africa Open for Business And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania where theyre having the session in June But it shows you Africans and particularly African women who against all odds have developed businesses some of them worldclass One of the women in this video Adenike Ogunlesi making childrens clothes  which she started as a hobby and grew into a business Mixing African materials such as we have with materials from elsewhere So shell make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys with African material mixed in Very creative designs has reached a stage where she even had an order from WalMart For  pieces So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing And the women are diligent They are focused they work hard I could go on giving examples Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing  other women and men to work with her However many of these are starved for capital to expand because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary Nobody thinks in terms of a market Nobody thinks theres opportunity But Im standing here saying that those who miss the boat now will miss it forever So if you want to be in Africa think about investing Think about the Beatrices think about the Adenikes of this world who are doing incredible things that are bringing them into the global economy whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income So I invite you to explore the opportunities When you go to Tanzania listen carefully because Im sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent for the people and for yourselves Thank you very much

128,Im really scared I dont think were going to make it Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gores amazing talk Shortly after I saw that we had some friends over for dinner with the family The conversation turned to global warming and everybody agreed theres a real problem Weve got a climate crisis So we went around the table to talk about what we should do The conversation came to my yearold daughter Mary She said I agree with everything thats been said Im scared and Im angry And then she turned to me and said Dad your generation created this problem youd better fix it Wow All the conversation stopped All the eyes turned to me I didnt know what to say Kleiners second law is There is a time when panic is the appropriate response And weve reached that time We cannot afford to underestimate this problem If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences we must act and we must act decisively Ive got to tell you for me everything changed that evening And so my partners and I we set off on this mission to learn more to try to do much more So we mobilized We got on airplanes We went to Brazil We went to China and to India to Bentonville Arkansas to Washington DC and to Sacramento And so what Id like to do now is to tell you about what weve learned in those journeys Because the more we learned the more concerned we grew You know my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine we just get together the smartest people we know For this climate crisis we assembled a network really of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders Fifty or so of them And so I want to tell you about what weve learned in doing that and four lessons Ive learned in the last year The first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot This is a story about how WalMart went green and what that means Two years ago the CEO Lee Scott believed that green is the next big thing and so WalMart made going green a top priority They committed that theyre going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by  percent and their new stores by  percent and do all that in seven years The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning then lighting and then refrigeration So look what they did They painted the roofs of all their stores white They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands And third they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting I mean why would you try to refrigerate a whole store These are really simple smart solutions based on existing technology Why does WalMart matter Well its massive Theyre the largest private employer in America Theyre the largest private user of electricity They have the secondlargest vehicle fleet on the road And they have one of the worlds most amazing supply chains  suppliers If WalMart were a country it would be the sixthlargest trading partner with China And maybe most important they have a big effect on other companies When WalMart declares its going to go green and be profitable it has a powerful impact on other great institutions So let me tell you this when WalMart achieves  percent energy reductions thats going to be a very big deal But Im afraid its not enough We need WalMart and every other company to do the same The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter and they matter enormously Ive got another WalMart story for you OK WalMart has over  million US customers Thats a third of the US population  million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year And WalMart has committed theyre going to sell another  million light bulbs in the coming year But its not easy Consumers dont really like these light bulbs The lights kind of funny they wont dim takes a while for them to start up But the payoff is really enormous  million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that well save  million dollars in energy bills and  million tons of CO every year year in and year out It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing It is stupid that we use two tons of steel glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall Its stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here Its hard to change consumer behavior because consumers dont know how much this stuff costs Do you know Do you know how much CO you generated to drive here or fly here I dont know and I should Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were But as long as we pretend that CO is free as long as these uses are nearly invisible how can we expect change Im really afraid because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough The third lesson we learned is that policy matters It really matters In fact policy is paramount Ive got a behindthescenes story for you about that green tech network I described At the end of our first meeting we got together to talk about what the action items would be how wed follow up And Bob Epstein raised a hand He stood up You know Bobs that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase Well Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento California that we need a marketbased system of mandates thats going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California Its necessary and just as important its good for the California economy So eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB You know what Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill so it passed and it passed by a vote of  to  Please Thank you I think its the most important legislation of  Why Because California was the first state in this country to mandate  percent reduction of greenhouse gases by  And the result of that is were going to generate  new jobs four billion dollars a year in annual income and reduce the CO emissions by  million tons a year California emits only seven percent of US CO emissions Its only a percent and a half of the countrys CO emissions Its a great start but Ive got to tell you  where I started  Im really afraid In fact Im certain Californias not enough Heres a story about national policy that we could all learn from You know Tom Friedman says If you dont go you dont know Well we went to Brazil to meet Dr Jose Goldemberg Hes the father of the ethanol revolution He told us that Brazils government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flexfuel compatible right Theyd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline And so heres whats happened in Brazil They now have  ethanol pumps  this versus  in the US and a paltry two in California  and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to  percent flexfuel Compare that to the US five percent are flexfuel And you know what Most consumers who have them dont even know it So whats happened in Brazil is theyve replaced  percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol Thats  billion dollars since  that they didnt ship to the Middle East Its created a million jobs inside that country and its saved  million tons of CO Its really substantial Thats  percent of the CO emissions across their entire country But Brazils only  percent of the worlds CO emission So Brazils ethanol miracle Im really afraid is not enough In fact Im afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough The fourth and final lesson weve learned is about the potential of radical innovation So I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease Thats malaria  people a day All for want of two dollars worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore Well two dollars two dollars is too much for Africa So a team of Berkeley researchers with  million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called artemisinin and theyre going to make that drug  times cheaper And in doing so theyll save a million lives  at least a million lives a year A million lives Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products Now what you do is you get inside the microbe you change its metabolic pathways and you end up with a living chemical factory Now you may ask John what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis Well Ill tell you  a lot Weve now formed a company called Amyris and this technology that theyre using can be used to make better biofuels Dont let me skip over that Better biofuels are a really big deal That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way So if all goes well theyre going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels I guess thats better living through bugs Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it And of course at Kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second best way is to finance it And thats why were investing  million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies And were encouraging others to do it as well Were talking a lot about this In  there were  million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here It doubled in  to  billion dollars But Im really afraid we need much much more For reference fact one Exxons revenues in  were a billion dollars a day Do you know they only invested  percent of revenues in RampD Second fact the Presidents new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total Less than one day of Exxons revenues Third fact I bet you didnt know that theres enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply Americas energy needs for the next thousand years And the federal budget calls for a measly  million dollars of RampD in geothermal energy It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country And I am really afraid that its absolutely not enough So in a years worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels And who would have thought that all that is not enough Not enough to stabilize the climate Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean The scientists tell us  and theyre only guessing  that weve got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half and do it as fast as possible Now we may have the political will to do this in the US but Ive got to tell you weve got only one atmosphere and so somehow were going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world The wild card in this deck is China To size the problem Chinas CO emissions today are  gigatons the US is  Business as usual means well have  gigatons from China by  Thats about as much CO as there is in the whole world And if its business as usual were going out of business When I was in Davos Chinas Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO strategy and he said the following You know Americans use seven times the CO per capita as Chinese Then he asked Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid Does anybody here have an answer for him I dont Weve got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome the profitable outcome and therefore the likely outcome Energys a sixtrilliondollar business worldwide It is the mother of all markets You remember that Internet Well Ill tell you what Green technologies  going green  is bigger than the Internet It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the st century Moreover if we succeed its going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since as Bill Joy says we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere Now heres the hard question if the trajectory of all the worlds companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough what are we going to do I dont know Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another So our call to action  my call to you  is for you to make going green your next big thing your gig What can you do You can personally get carbon neutral Go to ClimateCrisisorg or CarbonCalculatorcom and buy carbon credits You could join other leaders in mandating lobbying for mandated cap and trade in US greenhouse gas reductions Theres six bills right now in Congress Lets get one of them passed And the most important thing you can do I think is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business your institution in going green Do it like WalMart get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself Really think outside the box Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen It could be bigger than WalMart I cant wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis And I really really hope that we multiply all of our energy all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem Because if we do I can look forward to the conversation Im going to have with my daughter in  years ,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

129,"What Im going to show you first
as quickly as I can is some foundational work
some new technology that we brought to Microsoft
as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago This is Seadragon and its an environment in which you can either
locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data Were looking at many many gigabytes
of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly
and continuously zooming in panning through it
rearranging it in any way we want And it doesnt matter how much
information were looking at how big these collections are
or how big the images are Most of them are ordinary
digital camera photos but this one for example
is a scan from the Library of Congress and its in the  megapixel range It doesnt make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit
the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen
at any given moment Its also very flexible architecture This is an entire book
so this is an example of nonimage data This is Bleak House by Dickens Every column is a chapter To prove to you that its really text
and not an image we can do something
like so to really show that this is a real representation
of the text its not a picture Maybe this is an artificial way
to read an ebook I wouldnt recommend it This is a more realistic case
an issue of The Guardian Every large image
is the beginning of a section And this really gives you
the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version
of a magazine or a newspaper which is an inherently
multiscale kind of medium Weve done something with the corner of this particular
issue of The Guardian Weve made up a fake ad
thats very high resolution  much higher than in an ordinary ad  and weve embedded extra content If you want to see the features
of this car you can see it here Or other models
or even technical specifications And this really gets
at some of these ideas about really doing away
with those limits on screen real estate We hope that this means no more popups and other rubbish like that 
shouldnt be necessary Of course mapping is one
of those obvious applications for a technology like this And this one I really
wont spend any time on except to say that we have things
to contribute to this field as well But those are all the roads in the US superimposed on top
of a NASA geospatial image So lets pull up now something else This is actually live on the Web now
you can go check it out This is a project called Photosynth
which marries two different technologies One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very
beautiful computervision research done by Noah Snavely a graduate student
at the University of Washington coadvised by Steve Seitz at UW and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research A very nice collaboration And so this is live on the Web
Its powered by Seadragon You can see that
when we do these sorts of views where we can dive through images and have this kind
of multiresolution experience But the spatial arrangement of the images
here is actually meaningful The computer vision algorithms
have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real
space in which these shots  all taken near Grassi Lakes
in the Canadian Rockies  all these shots were taken So you see elements here of stabilized slideshow
or panoramic imaging and these things have
all been related spatially Im not sure if I have time
to show you any other environments Some are much more spatial I would like to jump straight
to one of Noahs original datasets  this is from an early prototype
that we first got working this summer  to show you what I think is really the punch line
behind the Photosynth technology Its not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments
weve put up on the website We had to worry
about the lawyers and so on This is a reconstruction
of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally
from images scraped from Flickr You just type Notre Dame into Flickr and you get some pictures of guys
in Tshirts and of the campus and so on And each of these orange cones
represents an image that was discovered
to belong to this model And so these are all Flickr images and theyve all been related
spatially in this way We can just navigate
in this very simple way Applause ends You know I never thought
that Id end up working at Microsoft Its very gratifying to have
this kind of reception here I guess you can see this is
lots of different types of cameras its everything from cellphone cameras
to professional SLRs quite a large number of them
stitched together in this environment If I can find some
of the sort of weird ones  So many of them are occluded
by faces and so on Somewhere in here there is actually
a series of photographs  here we go This is actually a poster of Notre Dame
that registered correctly We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment What the point here really is is that we can do things
with the social environment This is now taking data from everybody  from the entire collective memory
visually of what the Earth looks like  and link all of that together Those photos become linked
and they make something emergent thats greater than the sum of the parts You have a model that emerges
of the entire Earth Think of this as the long tail
to Stephen Lawlers Virtual Earth work And this is something that grows
in complexity as people use it and whose benefits become greater
to the users as they use it Their own photos are getting tagged
with metadata that somebody else entered If somebody bothered
to tag all of these saints and say who they all are
then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched
with all of that data and I can use it as an entry point
to dive into that space into that metaverse
using everybody elses photos and do a kind of a crossmodal and crossuser social experience that way And of course a byproduct of all of that
is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth collected not just from overhead flights
and from satellite images and so on but from the collective memory Thank you so much Applause ends Chris Anderson
Do I understand this right What your software is going to allow is that at some point
really within the next few years all the pictures that are shared
by anyone across the world are going to link together BAA Yes What this is really
doing is discovering creating hyperlinks
if you will between images Its doing that based on the content
inside the images And that gets really exciting
when you think about the richness of the semantic information
a lot of images have Like when you do a web search for images you type in phrases and the text on the web page is carrying
a lot of information about what that picture is of What if that picture links
to all of your pictures The amount of semantic
interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge Its a classic network effect CA Truly incredible Congratulations ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

130,"Thank you And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me I feel its sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area Vaishali and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him All the young people actually from the city The old fogeys dont come because theyre mad at Buddha because when he came to their city he accepted  he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him from whoever it is and the local geisha a moviestar sort of person raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first So he was hanging out with the movie star and of course they were grumbling Hes supposed to be religious and all this Whats he doing over there at Amrapalis house with all his  monks and so on They were all grumbling and so they boycotted him They wouldnt go listen to him But the young people all came And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol and they put it on the ground And as soon as they had laid all these all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium the wonder of the universe Everyone looked in that and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes And of course in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets So they dont  when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky  they dont just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected And then Leilei  I know his other name  told us about interconnection and how were all totally interconnected here and how weve all known each other And of course in the Buddhist universe weve already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past And I didnt give the talk always You did and we had to watch you and so forth And were all still trying to I guess were all trying to become TEDsters if thats a modern form of enlightenment I guess so Because in a way if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything its the forging of a mass awareness of where everybody can really know everything thats going on everywhere in the planet And therefore it will become intolerable  what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place or theyre being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth It just becomes intolerable With all of us knowing everything were kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something to become enlightened And of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired we do suffer We do enjoy our misery in a certain way We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other and each one tries to get out of their own and ultimately it fails of course and then were back into this thing Because our egocentric perception  from the Buddhas point of view misperception  is that all we are is what is inside our skin And its inside and outside self and other and other is all very different And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception a little bit right You know someone sitting next to you in a seat  thats OK because youre in a theater but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you youd freak out What do they want from me Like whos that And so you wouldnt sit that close to another person because of your notion that its you versus the universe  thats all Buddha discovered Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone each of us and everyone else is different then that puts us in an impossible situation doesnt it Who is it whos going to get enough attention from the world
 Whos going to get enough out of the world Whos not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings  if youre different from all the other beings So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way through art through meditation through understanding through knowledge actually knowing that you have no such boundary knowing your interconnectedness with other beings You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them When you do that youre forced to feel what they feel Luckily they say  I still am not sure  but luckily they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature they say Oh who would really want to be compassionate How awful Im so miserable on my own My head is aching My bones are aching I go from birth to death Im never satisfied I never have enough even if Im a billionaire I dont have enough I need a hundred billion So Im like that Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other peoples suffering It would be terrible But apparently this is a strange paradox of life When youre no longer locked in yourself and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you to let your mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing and realizing that you are the other being somehow by that opening you can see the deeper nature of life And you can you get away from this terrible iron circle of I me me mine like the Beatles used to sing You know we really learned everything in the s Too bad nobody ever woke up to it and theyve been trying to suppress it since then I me me mine Its like a perfect song that song A perfect teaching But when were relieved from that we somehow then become interested in all the other beings And we feel ourselves differently Its totally strange Its totally strange The Dalai Lama always likes to say  he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion its because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence Its really too boring whether you feel like this or like that or what you know  and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets Like even when youre having a good time when is the good time over The good time is over when you think how good is it And then its never good enough I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time doing it by having a good time I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that I wish hed been there to hear that He once told me  he looked kind of sad he worries very much about the haves and havenots He looked a little sad because he said well a hundred years ago they went and took everything away from the haves You know the big communist revolutions Russia and China and so forth They took it all away by violence saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse They didnt help at all So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today And so then he looks at me So I said Well you know youre all in this yourself You teach its generosity was all I could think of What is virtue But of course what you said I think the key to saving the world the key to compassion is that it is more fun It should be done by fun Generosity is more fun Thats the key Everybody has the wrong idea They think Buddha was so boring and theyre so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and hes fairly jolly Even though his people are being genocided  and believe me he feels every blow on every old nuns head in every Chinese prison He feels it He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays I wont even say what they do But he feels it And yet hes very jolly Hes extremely jolly Because when you open up like that then you cant just  what good does it do to add being miserable with others misery You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is how it can be changed Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us She scared us with the lava man She scared us with the lava man is coming then the tsunami is coming but then finally there were flowers and trees and it was very beautiful Its really lovely So compassion means to feel the feelings of others and the human being actually is compassion The human being is almost out of time The human being is compassion because what is our brain for Now Jims brain is memorizing the almanac But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is he will he did He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings And he would have tremendous fun doing that So the first person who gets happy when you stop focusing on the selfcentered situation of how happy am I where youre always dissatisfied  as Mick Jagger told us You never get any satisfaction that way So then you decide Well Im sick of myself Im going to think of how other people can be happy Im going to get up in the morning and think what can I do for even one other person even a dog my dog my cat my pet my butterfly And the first person who gets happy when you do that you dont do anything for anybody else but you get happier you yourself because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it And you realize that this  being with these people  is the flower garden that Chiho showed us It is Nirvana And my time is up And I know the TED commandments Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

131,So I kind of believe that were in like the cavepainting era of computer interfaces Like theyre very kind of  they dont go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and Id like to change all that Hit me OK So I mean this is the kind of status quo interface right Its very flat kind of rigid And OK so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac you know but really its the kind of same old crap weve had for the last you know  years Laughter Applause Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers I mean its point and click its like the menus icons its all the kind of same thing And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk Its so much more subtle so much more visceral  you know whats visible whats not And Id like to bring that experience to the desktop So I kind of have a  this is BumpTop Its kind of like a new approach to desktop computing So you can bump things  theyre all physically you know manipulable and stuff And instead of that point and click its like a push and pull things collide as youd expect them Just like on my real desk I can  let me just grab these guys  I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid or you know flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards When theyre laid out I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile you know just immediately right And then its all smoothly animated instead of these jarring changes you see in todays interfaces Also if I want to add something to a pile well how do I do that I just toss it to the pile and its added right to the top Its a kind of nice way Also some of the stuff we can do is for these individual icons we thought  I mean how can we play with the idea of an icon and push that further And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important But whats really cool is that since theres a physics simulation running under this its actually heavier So the lighter stuff doesnt really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys right So its cute but its also like a subtle channel of conveying information right This is heavy so it feels more important So its kind of cool Despite computers everywhere paper really hasnt disappeared because it has a lot of I think valuable properties And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system So one of the things you can do to our icons just like paper is crease them and fold them just like paper Remember you know something for later Or if you want to be destructive you can just crumple it up and you know toss it to the corner Also just like paper around our workspace well pin things up to the wall to remember them later and I can do the same thing here and you know youll see postit notes and things like that around peoples offices And I can pull them off when I want to work with them So one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that you know Okay well my real desk is really messy I dont want that mess on my computer So one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of  so you get that more traditional desktop Things are kind of grid aligned More boring but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop Lets just break this shelf Okay that shelf broke I think beyond the icons I think another really cool domain for this software  I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop  but browsing photographs I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of you know photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing I can toss these things around Theyre so much more tangible and touchable  and you know I can doubleclick on something to take a look at it And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before So I can pile things up I can flip through it I can you know  okay lets move this photo to the back lets delete this guy here and I think its just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information And thats BumpTop Thanks ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

139,What I want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds digital globes the D Web the Metaverse What does this all mean for us What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again Its going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world With graphics computing power low latencies these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives So the Virtual Earth initiative and other types of these initiatives are all about extending our current search metaphor When you think about it were so constrained by browsing the Web remembering URLs saving favorites As we move to search we rely on the relevance rankings the Web matching the index crawling But we want to use our brain We want to navigate explore discover information In order to do that we have to put you as a user back in the drivers seat We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer So what better way to put you back in the drivers seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day Why not leverage the learnings that youve been learning your entire life So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation comprehensive of the entire world What we want to do is mix in all types of data Tag it Attribute it Metadata Get the community to add local depth global perspective local knowledge So when you think about this problem what an enormous undertaking Where do you begin Well we collect data from satellites from airplanes from ground vehicles from people This process is an engineering problem a mechanical problem a logistical problem an operational problem Here is an example of our aerial camera This is panchromatic Its actually four color cones In addition its multispectral We collect four gigabits per second of data if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down Thats equivalent to a constellation of  satellites at highest res capacity We fly these airplanes at  feet in the air You can see the camera on the front We collect multiple viewpoints vantage points angles textures We bring all that data back in We sit here  you know think about the ground vehicles the human scale  what do you see in person We need to capture that up close to establish that what its liketype experience I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity So a little unknown secret is  did you see the one with the guy hes got the Web cam The poor PC guy Theyre duct taping his head Theyre just wrapping it on him Well a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team Laughter So theyve got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here But let me tell you  it doesnt affect his day job We think a lot of good can come from this technology This was after Katrina We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone We flew the area We imaged it We sent in people We took pictures of interiors disaster areas We helped with the first responders the search and rescue Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth We made it all freely available on the Web just to  it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause When we think about how all this comes together its all about software algorithms and math You know we capture this imagery but to build the D models we need to do geopositioning We need to do georegistering of the images We have to bundle adjust them Find tie points Extract geometry from the images This process is a very calculated process In fact it was always done manual Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because theyd have to do it manually Theyd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR Theyd collected information with photos Theyd manually build each building We do this all through software algorithms and math  a highly automated pipeline creating these cities We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities and thats how were going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream We think about the user interface What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives An orthoview a nadirview How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model Ill wrap up by showing you the  this is a brandnew peek I havent really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth What were doing is  people like this a lot this birds eye imagery we work with Its this high resolution data But what weve found is they like the fluidity of the D model A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller So here what were trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the D model space You can see all types of resolution From here I can slowly pan the image over I can get the next image I can blend and transition By doing this I dont lose the original detail In fact I might be recording history The freshness the capacity I can turn this image I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles What were trying to do is build a virtual world We hope that we can make computing a user model youre familiar with and really derive insights from you from all different directions I thank you very much for your time ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

140,I told you three things last year I told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available Because of that we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries which is wrong And that animated graphics can make a difference Things are changing and today on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page it says by first of May full access to the databases And if I could share the image with you on the screen So three things have happened UN opened their statistic databases and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net so you dont have to download it any longer And let me repeat what you saw last year The bubbles are the countries Here you have the fertility rate  the number of children per woman  and there you have the length of life in years This is   those were the industrialized countries those were developing countries At that time there was a we and them There was a huge difference in the world But then it changed and it went on quite well And this is what happens You can see how China is the red big bubble The blue there is India And they go over all this  Im going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed And its Africa that stands out as the problem down here doesnt it Large families still and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this This is more or less what we saw last year and this is how it will go on into the future And I will talk on is this possible Because you see now I presented statistics that dont exist Because this is where we are Will it be possible that this will happen I cover my lifetime here you know I expect to live  years And this is where we are today Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world And I would like to show that against child survival Well swap the axis Here you have child mortality  that is survival  four kids dying there  dying there And this is GDP per capita on this axis And this was  And if I go back in time Ive added some historical statistics  here we go here we go here we go  not so much statistics  years ago Some countries still had statistics We are looking down in the archive and when we are down into  there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers But they were down here They had  dollars per person per year And they lost onefifth of their kids before their first birthday So this is what happens in the world if we play the entire world How they got slowly richer and richer and they add statistics Isnt it beautiful when they get statistics You see the importance of that And here children dont live longer The last century  was bad for the kids in Europe because most of this statistics is Europe It was only by the turn of the century that more than  percent of the children survived their first year This is India coming up with the first data from India And this is the United States moving away here earning more money And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here And it moves up with Mao TseTung getting health not getting so rich There he died then Deng Xiaoping brings money It moves this way over here And the bubbles keep moving up there and this is what the world looks like today Let us have a look at the United States We have a function here  I can tell the world Stay where you are And I take the United States  we still want to see the background  I put them up like this and now we go backwards And we can see that the United States goes to the right of the mainstream They are on the money side all the time And down in  the United States was a neighbor of India  present contemporary India And that means United States was richer but lost more kids than India is doing today proportionally And look here  compare to the Philippines of today The Philippines of today has almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War But we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines About  here the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized is that Asia Arabic countries Latin America are much more ahead in being healthy educated having human resources than they are economically Theres a discrepancy in whats happening today in the emerging economies There now social benefits social progress are going ahead of economical progress And   the United States had the same economy as Chile has today And how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile has today I think we have to go there  we have  or   the United States has the same health as Chile Chiles catching up Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States This is really a change that you have this lag of more or less   years difference on the health And behind the health is the educational level And theres a lot of infrastructure things and general human resources are there Now we can take away this  and I would like to show you the rate of speed the rate of change how fast they have gone And we go back to  and I want to look at Japan And I want to look at Sweden and the United States And Im going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there and the brownish Volvo And here we go Here we go The Toyota has a very bad start down here you can see and the United States Ford is going offroad there And the Volvo is doing quite fine This is the war The Toyota got off track and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden  can you see that And they are taking over Sweden and they are now healthier than Sweden Thats the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan They really caught up And this changes gradually We have to look over generations to understand it And let me show you my own sort of family history  we made these graphs here And this is the same thing money down there and health you know And this is my family This is Sweden  when my greatgreatgrandma was born Sweden was like Sierra Leone today And this is when greatgrandma was born  And Sweden was like Mozambique And this is when my grandma was born  She took care of me as a child so Im not talking about statistic now  now its oral history in my family Thats when I believe statistics when its grandmaverified statistics I think its the best way of verifying historical statistics Sweden was like Ghana Its interesting to see the enormous diversity within subSaharan Africa I told you last year Ill tell you again my mother was born in Egypt and I  who am I Im the Mexican in the family And my daughter she was born in Chile and the granddaughter was born in Singapore now the healthiest country on this Earth It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago with better child survival But theyre very small you know Theyre so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests But homage to Singapore Singapore is the best one Now this looks also like a very good story But its not really that easy that its all a good story Because I have to show you one of the other facilities We can also make the color here represent the variable  and what am I choosing here Carbondioxide emission metric ton per capita This is  and United States was emitting  tons per person And China was emitting  and India was emitting  tons per capita And what happens when we moved on Well you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier  everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide There is no one who has done it so far And we dont have all the updated data any longer because this is really hot data today And there we are  And in the discussion I attended with global leaders you know many say now the problem is that the emerging economies they are getting out too much carbon dioxide The Minister of the Environment of India said Well you were the one who caused the problem The OECD countries  the highincome countries  they were the ones who caused the climate change But we forgive you because you didnt know it But from now on we count per capita From now on we count per capita And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission This really shows you we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate And this is really what has to be changed Ive been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world but I dont think its like this The world is quite a messy place This we can call Dollar Street Everyone lives on this street here What they earn here  what number they live on  is how much they earn per day This family earns about one dollar per day We drive up the street here we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day And we drive away here  we find the first garden in the street and they earn  to  dollars a day And how do they live If we look at the bed here we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor This is what poverty line is   percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs the food for the day This is two to five dollars You have a bed And here its a much nicer bedroom you can see I lectured on this for Ikea and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here And this is the sofa how it will emerge from there And the interesting thing when you go around here in the photo panorama you see the family still sitting on the floor there Although there is a sofa if you watch in the kitchen you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to  dollars It comes beyond here when you really can get good working conditions in the family And if you really want to see the difference you look at the toilet over here This can change This can change These are all pictures and images from Africa and it can become much better We can get out of poverty My own research has not been in IT or anything like this I spent  years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine And this is the result of the farmersneeds research The nice thing here is that you cant see who are the researchers in this picture Thats when research functions in poor societies  you must really live with the people When youre in poverty everything is about survival Its about having food And these two young farmers they are girls now  because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS  they discuss with a trained agronomist This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi Junatambe Kumbira and hes discussing what sort of cassava they will plant  the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found And they are very very eagerly interested to get advice and thats to survive in poverty Thats one context Getting out of poverty The women told us one thing Get us technology We hate this mortar to stand hours and hours Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves Technology will bring you out of poverty but theres a need for a market to get away from poverty And this woman is very happy now bringing her products to the market But shes very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count and wont be cheated when she reaches the market She wants her kid to be healthy so she can go to the market and doesnt have to stay home And she wants the infrastructure  it is nice with a paved road Its also good with credit Microcredits gave her the bicycle you know And information will tell her when to go to market with which product You can do this I find my experience from  years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible Africa has not done bad In  years theyve gone from a preMedieval situation to a very decent yearago Europe with a functioning nation and state I would say that subSaharan Africa has done best in the world during the last  years Because we dont consider where they came from Its this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us Argentina and Mozambique together  years ago and says that Mozambique did worse We have to know a little more about the world I have a neighbor who knows  types of wine He knows everything He knows the name of the grape the temperature and everything I only know two types of wine  red and white But my neighbor only knows two types of countries  industrialized and developing And I know  I know about the small data But you can do that But I have to get serious And how do you get serious You make a PowerPoint you know Homage to the Office package no What is this what is this what am I telling Im telling you that there are many dimensions of development Everyone wants your pet thing If you are in the corporate sector you love microcredit If you are fighting in a nongovernmental organization you love equity between gender Or if you are a teacher youll love UNESCO and so on On the global level we have to have more than our own thing We need everything All these things are important for development especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare Now what we need to think about is what is a goal for development and what are the means for development Let me first grade what are the most important means Economic growth to me as a publichealth professor is the most important thing for development because it explains  percent of survival Governance To have a government which functions  thats what brought California out of the misery of  It was the government that made law function finally Education human resources are important Health is also important but not that much as a mean Environment is important Human rights is also important but it just gets one cross Now what about goals Where are we going toward We are not interested in money Money is not a goal Its the best mean but I give it zero as a goal Governance well its fun to vote in a little thing but its not a goal And going to school thats not a goal its a mean Health I give two points I mean its nice to be healthy  at my age especially  you can stand here youre healthy And thats good it gets two plusses Environment is very very crucial Theres nothing for the grandkid if you dont save up But where are the important goals Of course its human rights Human rights is the goal but its not that strong of a mean for achieving development And culture Culture is the most important thing I would say because thats what brings joy to life Thats the value of living So the seemingly impossible is possible Even African countries can achieve this And Ive shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible And remember please remember my main message which is this the seemingly impossible is possible We can have a good world I showed you the shots I proved it in the PowerPoint and I think I will convince you also by culture Bring me my sword Sword swallowing is from ancient India Its a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel  solid steel  this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army  in the last year we had war And its all solid steel  you can hear here And Im going to take this blade of steel and push it down through my body of blood and flesh and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible Can I request a moment of absolute silence ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

141,First place Id like to take you is what many believe will be the worlds deepest natural abyss And I say believe because this process is still ongoing Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that Ill talk a little bit about One of the things thats changed here in the last  years since Jules Verne had great sciencefiction concepts of what the underworld was like is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity Along the way weve discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight When you go on a thing like this we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months with a team as small as  or  to as big as  And a lot of people ask me you know what kind of people do you get for a project like this While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA its nonetheless thorough Were looking for competence discipline endurance and strength In case youre wondering this is our strength test But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve interpersonal conflict while under great stress in remote locations We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance From the entrance this is nothing like a commercial cave Youre looking at Camp Two in a place called J not K but J Were roughly two days from the entrance at that point And its kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse except that youre now running a string of these things down The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while youre down there otherwise in damp moist cold conditions in utterly dark places I should mention that everything youre seeing here by the way is artificially illuminated at great effort Otherwise it is completely dark in these places The deeper you go the more you run into a conflict with water Its basically like a tree collecting water coming down And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just dont do justice So Ive got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late s So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico Video Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film Along that same line I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year we have never seen monsters underground  at least the kind that eat you If there is a monster underground it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance Next year Ill be leading an international team to J Were going to be shooting from minus  meters  thats a little over  feet down  at  kilometers from the entrance The lead crews will be underground for pushing  days straight I dont think theres been a mission like that in a long time Eventually if you keep going down in these things probability says that youre going to run into a place like this Its a place where theres a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof And when you used to find these things they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon Now I remember that term really well for two reasons Number one its the name of my rock band and second is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor And weve since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this This is some lifesupport equipment closedcycle And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of  meters straight down underwater When you do this kind of stuff its like doing EVA Its like doing extravehicular activity in space but at much greater distances and at much greater physical peril So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range away from a safe haven Heres a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in  Video Narrator Exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet To experience it is a privilege Bill Stone That was taken in Wakulla Springs Florida Couple of things to note about that movie Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before  It was developed within a twoyear period and used on actual exploratory projects This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper and it produced the first threedimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world This is Europa Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there For those who have never seen this story Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago called Aliens of the Deep There was a brief clip  Video Narrator A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice Now we have to get through the ice You need a melt probe Its basically a nuclearheated torpedo The ice could be anywhere from three to  miles deep Week after week the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice until finally  Now what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean You need an AUV an autonomous underwater vehicle It needs to be one smart puppy able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean BS What Jim didnt know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV I mean I cut through three years of engineering meetings design and system integration and introduced DEPTHX  Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer And as the movie says this is one smart puppy Its got  sensors  onboard computers  lines of behavioral autonomy code packs more than  kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent This is the target site the worlds deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico Its been explored to a depth of  meters and beyond that nobody knows anything This is part of DEPTHXs mission There are two primary targets were doing here One is how do you do science autonomy underground How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist There are more stages involved here than Ive got time to tell you about but basically we drive through the space we populate it with environmental variables  sulphide halide things like that We calculate gradient surfaces and drive the bot over to a wall where theres a high probability of life We move along the wall in whats called proximity operations looking for changes in color If we see something that looks interesting we pull it into a microscope If it passes the microscopic test we go for a collection We either draw in a liquid sample or we can actually take a solid core from the wall No hands at the wheel This is all behavioral autonomy here thats being conducted by the robot on its own The real hat trick for this vehicle though is a disruptive new navigation system weve developed known as D SLAM for simultaneous localization and mapping DEPTHX is an allseeing eyeball Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time allowing it to do new exploration while its still achieving geometric sensorlock on what its gone through already What Im going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground thats ever been done This May were going to go from minus  meters in Zacaton and if were very lucky DEPTHX will bring back the first roboticallydiscovered division of bacteria The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go we could potentially launch by  and by  we may have the first evidence of life off this planet What then of manned space exploration The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by  The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were  years ago Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime What Im going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas And I hope youll bear with me and have some faith that theres credibility behind what were going to say here There are three underpinnings of working in space privately One of them is the requirement for economical earthtospace transport The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them Go go go The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit Orbital hotels to start with but workshops for the rest of us later on The final missing piece the real paradigmbuster is this a gas station on orbit Its not going to look like that If it existed it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning Now to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement Ive got to give you the basics of Space  And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram Anybody drink one of these here this week Youd pay  dollars for that in orbit Thats more than you pay for TED if Google dropped their sponsorship The second is more than  percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant Thus every time youd want to do anything in space you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics So what if you could get your gas at a th the price There is a place where you can In fact you can get it better  you can get it at  times lower if you can find propellant on the moon There is a littleknown mission that was launched by the Pentagon  years ago now called Clementine And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon That signal was so strong it could only have been produced by  trillion tons of water buried in the sediment collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material If were going to get that and make that gas station possible we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space We cant do that right now The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces We have to beat that We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything This is an idea that again came out of Livermore back in  with Dr Lowell Woods group And we can extend that now to just about everything Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit We can go much further We can build space tugs orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water Theres another thing When youre coming back from the moon you have to deal with orbital mechanics It says youre moving  feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station You got two choices You can burn rocket fuel to get there or you can do something really incredible You can dive into the stratosphere and precisely dissipate that velocity and come back out to the space station It has never been done Its risky and its going to be one hell of a ride  better than Disney The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency If you try to do that for the moon youre going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there But if you send a mining team there without the return propellant first  Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez This is not like that Im much more like Scotty I like this equipment you know and I really value it so were not going to burn the gear But if you were truly bold you could get it there manufacture it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done Theres a myth that you cant do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and  years Thats not true In seven years we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in lowearth orbit Were living in one of the most exciting times in history Were at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space The orbital refueling stations Ive just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed We can do it by jumpstarting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater to mine the moon for resources and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED I intend to lead that expedition It can be done in seven years with the right backing Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who had they been here today would have heartily approved There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier We have collectively forgotten that lesson Now were at a time when boldness is required to move forward  years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier in our time for all of us Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

142,Im going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope When we go to the physician today  when we go to the doctors office and we walk in there are words that we just dont want to hear There are words that were truly afraid of Diabetes cancer Parkinsons Alzheimers heart failure lung failure  things that we know are debilitating diseases for which theres relatively little that can be done And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease why its important why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasnt and where we are clinically today and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdles are And were going to do all of that in  minutes I promise I want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it This was an issue from  that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human It was basically a regenerative medicine issue Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand Its simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there We know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine This is not regenerative medicine Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like  and Ill come back to that theme a few times  instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue So that at the end of the treatment you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment Very few good ideas  if you agree that this is a good idea  very few good ideas are truly novel And this is just the same If you look back in history Charles Lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller to begin to think about could you culture organs And they published this book in  where they actually began to think about what could you do in bioreactors to grow whole organs Weve come a long way since then Im going to share with you some of the exciting work thats going on But before doing that what Id like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe One of the challenges is that the richer we are the longer we live And the longer we live the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of  And you can basically see that the richer a country is the older the people are within it Why is this important And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now If the average age of your population is  then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of asthma If the average age in your country is  to  now the average person is looking at diabetes earlyonset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease  things that are inherently more difficult to treat and much more expensive to treat Just have a look at the demographics in the US here This is from The Untied States of America In  there were  workers per retiree  people who were basically outside of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease In  two workers per retiree in the US And this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country in the world How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this This is age versus cost of health care And you can see that right around age   to  theres a sudden spike in the cost of health care Its actually quite interesting If you do the right studies you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care plotted over your lifetime And about seven years before youre about to die theres a spike And you can actually   we wont get into that There are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging Id suggest there are four things and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system All those things do is change who pays They dont actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is One thing you can do is not treat You can ration health care We wont talk about that anymore Its too depressing You can prevent Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention But perhaps most interesting to me anyway and most important is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom Think of it in terms of diabetes for instance Today with diabetes what do we do We diagnose the disease eventually once it becomes symptomatic and then we treat the symptom for     years And we do OK Insulins a pretty good therapy But eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease Why couldnt we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it was symptomatic And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it but if it worked we would truly be able to do something different This video I think gets across the concept that Im talking about quite dramatically This is a newt regrowing its limb If a newt can do this kind of thing why cant we Ill actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment But what were talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body for tissues and for organs themselves So todays reality is that if we get sick the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life I would pose to you that tomorrow  and when tomorrow is we could debate but its within the foreseeable future  we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation Theres a limb prosthetic up here similar actually one on the soldier thats come back from Iraq There are  soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs Imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that limb Its a wild concept Ill show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept But its applicable again to every organ system How can we do that The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body We need to learn to speak the bodys language And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus A mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will regrow that limb So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of woundhealing mechanisms Its a natural process but it is lost as we age In a child before the age of about six months if they lose their fingertip in an accident theyll regrow their fingertip By the time theyre five they wont be able to do that anymore So to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the bodys language And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today Im going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body The first is cellular therapies Clearly we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work Therefore if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body they may do the healing Secondly we can use materials We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials If we can invent materials design materials or extract materials from a natural environment then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself And finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal Im going to show you an example of each of these and Im going to start with materials Steve Badylak  whos at the University of Pittsburgh  about a decade ago had a remarkable idea And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself And he asked a very important question He asked the question if I take that material which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and I place it somewhere else on a persons body would it give a tissuespecific response or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear I wouldnt be telling you this story if it werent compelling The picture Im about to show you is a compelling picture However for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish  even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends  the lights are down This is a good time to look at your feet check your Blackberry do anything other than look at the screen What Im about to show you is a diabetic ulcer And although  its good to laugh before we look at this This is the reality of diabetes I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers we just dont connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you cant heal it So Im going to put the slide up now It wont be up for long This is a diabetic ulcer Its tragic The treatment for this is amputation This is an older lady She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes and has decided to die with what s left of her body intact And this lady decided after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented Thats what the wound looked like  weeks later That material contained only natural signals And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didnt have before Theres going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you  Ill let you know when you can look again This is a horse The horse is not in pain If the horse was in pain I wouldnt show you this slide The horse just has another nostril thats developed because of a riding accident Just a few weeks after treatment  in this case taking that material turning it into a gel and packing that area and then repeating the treatment a few times  and the horse heals up And if you took an ultrasound of that area it would look great Heres a dolphin where the fins been reattached There are now  patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds Could you regenerate a limb DARPA just gave Steve  million dollars to lead an eightinstitution project to begin the process of asking that question And Ill show you the  million dollar picture This is a  yearold man whos lost the end of his fingertip Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips After treatment thats what it looks like This is happening today This is clinically relevant today There are materials that do this Here are the heart patches But could you go a little further Could you say instead of using material can I take some cells along with the material and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a biodegradable material on there You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Womens Hospital He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish He chills the dish it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish Its the coolest stuff Now Im going to show you cellbased regeneration And what Im going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient Again if youre squeamish you dont want to watch But this ones kind of cool So this is a bypass operation just like what Al Gore had with a difference In this case at the end of the bypass operation youre going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient And Im standing up here because at one point Im going to show you just how early this technology is Here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient And if you look really carefully its going to be right around this point youll actually see a backflush You see the cells coming back out We need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place at the right time Just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data This was a randomized trial At this time this was an N of  Now theres an N of about  Basically if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass they get a little bit better If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass for these particular patients they became asymptomatic These are now two years out The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state This is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively with only three holes in the body where theyre taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure There go the cells We dont have time to go into all of those details but basically that works too You can take patients who are less sick and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy Heres another example of stemcell therapy that isnt quite clinical yet but I think very soon will be This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh along with a number of colleagues around the world Theyve decided that liposuction fluid which  in the United States we have a lot of liposuction fluid Its a great source of stem cells Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid So you could go in you could get your tummytuck Out comes the liposuction fluid and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons All done in the lab And I think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their own fatderived or adiposederived stem cells I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease Heres just one example before I close up This is equally tragic We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army who have to treat the now  kids that have come back from Iraq Many of those patients are very severely burned And if theres anything thats been learned about burn its that we dont know how to treat it Everything that is done to treat burn  basically we do a sodding approach We make something over here and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take In this case here a new wearable bioreactor has been designed  it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR  by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh And that bioreactor will lay down in the wound bed The gun that you see there sprays cells Thats going to spray cells over that area The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment deliver other things as well at the same time and therefore we will seed that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach Its a completely different way of doing it So my  minutes is up So let me finish up with some good news and maybe a little bit of bad news The good news is that this is happening today Its very powerful work Clearly the images kind of get that across Its incredibly difficult because its highly interdisciplinary Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen A number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease The Japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first  billion later another  billion in this field Its no coincidence Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age They need this to work or their health system dies So theyre putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area The European Union same thing China the same thing China just launched a national tissueengineering center The first year budget was  million US dollars In the United States weve had a somewhat different approach Oh for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president Weve had a different approach And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along But theres been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way And Im going to finish up with a quote maybe a little cheap shot at the director of the NIH whos a very charming man Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that  billion dollars that hes going to get next year and focus it in a strategic way to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients And at the end of a very testy meeting what the NIH director said was Your vision is larger than our appetite Id like to close by saying that no ones going to change our vision but together we can change his appetite Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

143,So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in subSaharan Africa And this is a pretty welleducated audience so I imagine you all know something about AIDS You probably know that roughly  million people in Africa are infected with the virus that AIDS is a disease of poverty and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty we would decrease AIDS as well If you know something more you probably know that Uganda to date is the only country in subSaharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain be faithful and use condoms  the ABC campaign  they decreased their prevalence in the s from about  percent to  percent over just a few years If you follow policy you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged  billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic So today Im going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic and Im actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know To do that Im going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic And Im not really going to talk much about the economy Im not going to tell you about exports and prices But Im going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem thats more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology And I think in that sense this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea Here Im really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another So we think first and foremost AIDS is a policy issue And probably for most people in this room thats how you think about it But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic Its going to be about thinking about how it evolves and how people respond to it I think it may seem like Im ignoring the policy stuff which is really the most important but Im hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works And the first thing that I want to talk about the first thing I think we need to understand is how do people respond to the epidemic So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection and it kills you So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS theres a really significant cost of sex If youre an uninfected man living in Botswana where the HIV rate is  percent if you have one more partner this year  a longterm partner girlfriend mistress  your chance of dying in  years increases by three percentage points That is a huge effect And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex And in fact among gay men in the US we did see that kind of change in the s So if we look in this particularly highrisk sample theyre being asked Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months Over a period from  to  that share drops from about  percent to  percent Its a huge change in a very short period of time We didnt see anything like that in Africa So we dont have quite as good data but you can see here the share of single men having premarital sex or married men having extramarital sex and how that changes from the early s to late s and late s to early s The epidemic is getting worse People are learning more things about it We see almost no change in sexual behavior These are just tiny decreases  two percentage points  not significant This seems puzzling But Im going to argue that you shouldnt be surprised by this and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does  as an investment So if youre a software engineer and youre trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program its important to think about how much it costs Its also important to think about what the benefit is And one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active If version  is coming out next week theres no point in adding more functionality into version nine But your health decisions are the same Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies thats a costly investment in your health But how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future even if you dont make those investments AIDS is the same kind of thing Its costly to avoid AIDS People really like to have sex But you know it has a benefit in terms of future longevity But life expectancy in Africa even without AIDS is really really low  or  years in a lot of places I think its possible if we think about that intuition and think about that fact that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change But we really need to test that And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more And the way that Im going to do that is Im going to look across areas with different levels of malaria So malaria is a disease that kills you Its a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa in addition to a lot of children And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where theres less malaria So thats what this figure shows you This shows you  in areas with low malaria medium malaria high malaria  what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence If you look at the blue line the areas with low levels of malaria you can see in those areas actually the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as HIV prevalence goes up Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some  it doesnt decrease as much And areas with high levels of malaria  actually its increasing a little bit although thats not significant This is not just through malaria Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality Theres another risk and they respond less to this existing risk So by itself I think this tells a lot about how people behave It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa But it also tells us something about policy Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria in combating poor indoor air quality in improving maternal mortality rates Because if you improve those things then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before Education campaigns like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding may not be enough at least not alone If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own even if they know everything about the disease they still may not change their behavior So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself People arent changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic So were going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past The reason that we know that the ABC campaign was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time In Uganda we see the prevalence went down We know they had this campaign Thats how we learn about what works Its not the only place we had any interventions Other places have tried things so why dont we look at those places and see what happened to their prevalence Unfortunately theres almost no good data on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about  So if I asked you Why dont you go and find me the prevalence in Burkina Faso in  You get on Google you Google and you find actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in  are STD patients and pregnant women which is not a terribly representative group of people Then if you poked a little more you looked a little more at what was going on youd find that actually that was a pretty good year because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users But even worse  some years its only IV drug users some years its only pregnant women We have no way to figure out what happened over time We have no consistent testing Now in the last few years we actually have done some good testing In Kenya in Zambia and a bunch of countries theres been testing in random samples of the population But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in  but I cant tell you anything about  or  So this is a problem for policy It was a problem for my research And I started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past And I think that the answer is we can look at mortality data and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past To do this were going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease It kills people in the prime of their lives Not a lot of other diseases have that profile And you can see here  this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people That suggests its pretty similar levels of development But in this middle region between  and  the death rates in Botswana are much much much higher than in Egypt But since there are very few other diseases that kill people we can really attribute that mortality to HIV But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past So it turns out if you use this technique actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what we get from testing random samples in the population but theyre very very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS and prevalence based on the mortality data for the years in the late s in nine countries in Africa You can see almost without exception the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortalitybased estimates UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is  percent and mortality estimates suggest its only about  percent And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates So this is another way to see this You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says we have to really see  deaths per  rather than  deaths per  in this age group Im going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something thats going to help us think about the world But this also tells us that one of these facts that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right If you think that  million people are infected if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high maybe thats more like  or  million It doesnt mean that AIDS isnt a problem Its a gigantic problem But it does suggest that that number might be a little big What I really want to do is I want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower And I said in the beginning I wasnt going to tell you about exports When I started working on these projects I was not thinking at all about economics but eventually it kind of sucks you back in So I am going to talk about exports and prices And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity in particular export volume and HIV infections So obviously as an economist Im deeply familiar with the fact that development that openness to trade is really good for developing countries Its good for improving peoples lives But openness and interconnectedness it comes with a cost when we think about disease I dont think this should be a surprise On Wednesday I learned from Laurie Garrett that Im definitely going to get the bird flu and I wouldnt be at all worried about that if we never had any contact with Asia And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight who got the disease in Africa and brought it back And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US In Africa epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people Areas with a lot of economic activity  with a lot of roads with a lot of urbanization  those areas have higher prevalence than others But that actually doesnt mean at all that if we gave people more exports more trade that that would increase prevalence By using this new data using this information about prevalence over time we can actually test that And so it seems to be  fortunately I think  it seems to be the case that these things are positively related More exports means more AIDS And that effect is really big So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy From a forecasting perspective if we know where trade is likely to change for example because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act or other policies that encourage trade we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV And we can go and we can try to have preemptive preventive measures there Likewise as were developing policies to try to encourage exports if we know theres this externality  this extra thing thats going to happen as we increase exports  we can think about what the right kinds of policies are But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS its not necessarily the case that improving poverty  at least in the short run that improving exports and improving development  its not necessarily the case that thats going to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence So throughout this talk Ive mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda and the fact that its the only country in subSaharan Africa with successful prevention Its been widely heralded Its been replicated in Kenya and Tanzania and South Africa and many other places But now I want to actually also question that Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence in Uganda in the s Its true that they had an education campaign But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period There was a big decline in coffee prices Coffee is Ugandas major export Their exports went down a lot in the early s  and actually that decline lines up really really closely with this decline in new HIV infections So you can see that both of these series  the black line is export value the red line is new HIV infections  you can see theyre both increasing Starting about  theyre both going down a lot And then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before it suggests that somewhere between  percent and  percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign But thats enormously important for policy Were spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign And if it was only  percent as effective as we think that it was then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision There are tons of other things that we should think about doing And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things I hope that in the last  minutes Ive told you something that you didnt know about AIDS and I hope that Ive gotten you questioning a little bit some of the things that you did know And I hope that Ive convinced you maybe that its important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy But more than anything you know Im an academic And when I leave here Im going to go back and sit in my tiny office and my computer and my data And the thing thats most exciting about that is every time I think about research there are more questions There are more things that I think that I want to do And whats really really great about being here is Im sure that the questions that you guys have are very very different than the questions that I think up myself And I cant wait to hear about what they are So thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

144,So I really consider myself a storyteller But I dont really tell stories in the usual way in the sense that I dont usually tell my own stories Instead Im really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories people all around the world I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common I think people are very similar but I also think that we have trouble seeing that You know as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps and I think we all see a lot of gaps And we define ourselves by our gaps Theres language gaps theres ethnicity and racial gaps theres age gaps theres gender gaps theres sexuality gaps theres wealth and money gaps theres education gaps theres also religious gaps You know we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something some smaller community But I think that actually despite our gaps we really have a lot in common And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves I think this is a very old human desire Its nothing new But the thing about selfexpression is that theres traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen This also is nothing new Since the dawn of human history weve tried to rectify this imbalance by making art writing poems singing songs scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper gossiping with friends This is nothing new Whats new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities these acts of selfexpression have been moving onto the Internet And as thats happened people have been leaving behind footprints footprints that tell stories of their moments of selfexpression And so what I do is I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them  what they feel what they think whats different in the world today than usual these sorts of questions One project that explores these ideas which was made about a year ago is a piece called We Feel Fine This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the worlds newlyposted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases I feel or I am feeling And when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the sentence up to the period and then automatically tries to deduce the age gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence Then knowing the geographical location and the time we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence All of this information is saved in a database that collects about  feelings a day Its been running for about a year and a half Its reached about sevenandahalf million human feelings now And Ill show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized So this is We Feel Fine What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside  so that happy positive feelings are brightly colored And sad negative feelings are darkly colored The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside so that the large dots contain large sentences and the small dots contain small sentences Any dot can be clicked and expanded And we see here I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions And all of these are stated by people I know that objectively it really doesnt mean much but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond its nice to feel bigger again The dots exhibit human qualities They kind of have their own physics and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life And then they also exhibit curiosity You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine Were currently seeing Madness Theres also Murmurs Montage Mobs Metrics and Mounds And Ill walk you through a few of those now Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling And then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings I feel a bit better now I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do I feel gypped out of something awesome here I feel so free I feel so good I feel like Im in this fog of depression that I cant get out of And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected And in that way you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy The next movement is called Montage Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid This grid is then said to represent the picture of the worlds feelings in the last few hours if you will Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up We see I just feel like Im not going to have fun if its not the both of us That was from someone in Michigan We see I feel like I have been at a computer all day These are automatically constructed using the found objects I think I feel a little full The next movement is called mobs Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the worlds feelings in the last few hours We see that better is the most frequent feeling right now followed by good bad guilty right down sick and so on We can also get a gender breakdown And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men We can do an age breakdown which gives us a histogram of the worlds emotional distribution by age We see people in their twenties are the most prolific followed by teenagers and then people in their thirties and it dies out very quickly from there In weather the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if theyre part of the sun The cloudy ones float along as if theyre on a breeze The rainy ones fall down as if theyre in a rainstorm and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground Finally location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings Metrics provides more numerical views on the data We see that the world is feeling used at  times the normal level right now Theyre feeling warm at  times the normal level and so on Other views are also available Here are gender age weather location The final movement is called Mounds Its a bit different from the others Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle And if I hold down my cursor they do a little dance We see better is the most frequent feeling followed by bad And then if I go over here the list begins to scroll and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected You can see the little pink cursor moving along representing our position Here we see people that feel slipping nauseous responsible Theres also a search capability if youre interested in finding out about a certain population For instance you could find women who feel addicted in their s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh But Ill spare you that So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isnt even room for me I feel very lonely I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful I feel invisible to you I wouldnt hide it if society didnt make me feel like I needed to I feel in love with Carolyn I feel so naughty I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life I love how I feel today So as you can see We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call passive observation What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives It scans the worlds blogs and looks at what people are writing and these people dont know theyre being watched or interviewed And because of that you end up getting very honest candid sincere responses that are often very moving And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people dont know theyre being interviewed Theyre just living life and they end up just acting like that Another technique is directly questioning people And this is a technique that I explored in a different project the Yahoo Time Capsule which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in  It was divided into ten very simple themes  love anger sadness and so on  each of which contained a single very openended question put to the world What do you love What makes you angry What makes you sad What do you believe in And so on The time capsule was available for one month online translated into  languages and this is what it looked like Its a spinning globe the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted This is in response to Whats beautiful Miss World There are two modes to the time capsule Theres One World which presents the spinning globe and Many Voices which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo where for three consecutive nights the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls which stand about  feet tall It was really incredible And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a watt laser into outer space You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a  degree angle there This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier  the differences in age gender and wealth and so on But you know as I looked at this more and more and more and saw these images go across the rocks I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again You know weddings births funerals the first car the first kiss the first camel or horse  depending on the culture And it was really moving And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories You know as a child in Vermont on a farm where I grew up I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion the Hunter And as an adult Ive been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night You know Orion facing the roaring bull Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus I mean these are the great tales of the Greeks And it caused me to wonder about our world today And it caused me to wonder specifically if we could make new constellations today what would those look like What would those be If we could make new pictures in the sky what would we draw What are the great stories of today And those are the questions that inspired my new project which is debuting here today at TED Nobodys seen this yet publicly Its called Universe Revealing Our Modern Mythology And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky So its my great pleasure now to show this to you So Universe will open here And youll see that it leads with a shifting star field and theres an Aurora Borealis in the background kind of morphing with color The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom and well put it down here to red So you see this kind of  these stars moving along Now these arent just little points of light little pixels Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world  a quote that was stated by somebody an image a news story a person a company You know some kind of heroic personality And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars that shapes begin to emerge We see here theres a little man walking along or maybe a woman And we see here a photograph with a head You can start to see words emerging here And those are the constellations of today And I can turn them all on and you can see them moving across the sky now This is the universe of  the last two months The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world Its using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York actually called Daylife And its kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the worlds current mythology over the last couple of months So we can see where its emerging here like President Ford Iraq Bush And we can actually isolate just the words  I call them secrets  and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently President Ford  this is Gerald Fords funeral We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe and everything else will enter its orbit So well click Ford and now that becomes the center And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it We can isolate just the photographs and we now see those We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe Now the things that relate to it are swirling around We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husbands coffin In Universe theres kind of no end It just goes infinitely and you can just kind of click on stuff This is a photographic representation called Snapshots But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe So if we want to lets check out what Bill Clintons universe looks like And lets see in the past week what hes been up to So now we have a new universe which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton We can have his constellations emerge here We can pull out his secrets and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates Hillary presidential Barack Obama We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now Any of those can be opened up So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama You can see that this is an important story there are a lot of things in its orbit If we open this up we get different perspectives on this story You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source This ones from Al Jazeera We can also see the superstars These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton So theres Bill Clinton Hillary Iraq George Bush Barack Obama Scooter Libby  these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton We can also see a world map so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so We can see hes been focused in America because hes been campaigning probably but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East And then we can also see a timeline So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday but he was back to work on Sunday morning and actually been tapering off since then this week And its not limited to just people or dates but we can actually put in concepts also So if I put in climate change for all of  well see what that universe looks like Here we have our star field Here we have our shapes Here we have our secrets So we see again climate change is large Nairobi global conference environmental And there are also quotes that you can see if youre interested in reading about quotes on climate change You know this is really an infinite thing The superstars of climate change in  United States Britain China You know these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept So this is a piece that demands exploration This will be online in several days probably next Tuesday And youll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be Youll notice that in Daylife  rather in Universe  it supports both the notion of a global mythology which is represented by something as broad as say  and also a personal mythology As you search for the things that are important to you in your world and then see what the constellations of those might look like So its been a pleasure Thank you very much

145,I study ants and thats because I like to think about how organizations work And in particular how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization So ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that and there are many others The web is one There are many biological systems like that  brains cells developing embryos There are about  species of ants They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers And all ant colonies have in common that theres no central control Nobody tells anybody what to do The queen just lays the eggs Theres no management No ant directs the behavior of any other ant And I try to figure out how that works And Ive been working for the past  years on a population of seedeating ants in southeastern Arizona Heres my study site This is really a picture of ants and the rabbit just happens to be there And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds This is the nest of the mature colony and theres the nest entrance And they forage maybe for about  meters away gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest and store them And every year I go there and make a map of my study site This is just a road And its not very big its about  meters on one side  on the other And every colony has a name which is a number which is painted on a rock And I go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before and figure out which ones have died and put all the new ones on the map And by doing this I know how old they all are And because of that Ive been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony Ants never make more ants colonies make more colonies And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives  those are the ones with wings  on a mating flight So every year on the same day  and its a mystery exactly how that happens  each colony sends out its virgin unmated queens with wings and the males and they all fly to a common place And they mate And this shows a recently virgin queen Heres her wings And shes in the process of mating with this male and theres another male on top waiting his turn Often the queens mate more than once And after that the males all die Thats it for them And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere drop their wings dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs And they will live for  or  years continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating So the queen goes down in there She lays eggs she feeds the larvae  so an ant starts as an egg then its a larva She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves Then as soon as the ants  the first group of ants  emerge theyre larvae Then theyre pupae Then they come out as adult ants They go out they get the food they dig the nest and the queen never comes out again So this is a oneyearold colony  this happens to be  Theres the nest entrance theres a pencil for scale So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer This is a threeyearold colony Theres the nest entrance theres a pencil for scale They make a midden a pile of refuse  mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat This is a fiveyearold colony This is the nest entrance heres a pencil for scale This is about as big as they get about a meter across And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes  so this is about  worker ants  changes as a function of colony age in years So it starts out with zero ants just the founding queen and it grows to a size of about  or  thousand ants when the colony is five And it stays that size until the queen dies and theres nobody to make more ants when shes about  or  years old And its when they reach this stable size in numbers of ants that they start to reproduce That is to send more winged queens and males to that years mating flight And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because Ive dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants Laughter So thats not the most fun part of this research although its interesting Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation Thats not just how is the colony organized but how does it change what its doing How is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change So things happen to an ant colony When it rains in the summer it floods in the desert Theres a lot of damage to the nest and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess When extra food becomes available  and this is what everybody knows about picnics  then extra ants are allocated to collect the food So with nobody telling anybody what to do how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task And thats the process that I call task allocation And in harvester ants I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories where an ant is foraging when its out along the foraging trail searching for food or bringing food back The patrollers  thats supposed to be a magnifying glass  are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go and by coming back  just by making it back  they tell the foragers that its safe to go out Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishmans house That is that there are chambers inside they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobelike surface in it It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand put it down turn around and go back in And finally the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse On one day itll all be here and then the next day theyll move it over there and then theyll move it back So thats what the midden workers do And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest So thats only about  percent of the colony and theyre the oldest ants So an ant starts out somewhere near the queen And when we dig up nests we find theyre about as deep as the colony is wide so about a meter deep for the big old nests And then theres another long tunnel and a chamber where we often find the queen after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes I dont think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes but instead because when theres flooding occasionally the colony has to go down deep So theres this whole network of chambers The queens in there somewhere she just lays eggs Theres the larvae and they consume most of the food And this is true of most ants  that the ants you see walking around dont do much eating They bring it back and feed it to the larvae When the foragers come in with food they just drop it into the upper chamber and other ants come up from below get the food bring it back husk the seeds and pile them up There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest And curiously and interestingly it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing So despite what it says in the Bible about you know Look to the ant thou sluggard in fact you could think of those ants as reserves That is to say if something happened  and Ive never seen anything like this happen but Ive only been looking for  years  if something happened they might all come out if they were needed But in fact mostly theyre just hanging around in there And I think its a very interesting question  what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing And they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside And if you mark ants that are working outside and dig up a colony you never see them deep down So whats happening is that the ants work inside the nest when theyre younger They somehow get into this reserve And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce And once they belong to the ants that work outside they never go back down Now ants  most ants including these dont see very well They have eyes they can distinguish between light and dark but they mostly work by smell So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isnt true  you know even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest So thats one way that we know the queen isnt directing the behavior of the colony So when I first set out to work on task allocation my first question was Whats the relationship between the ants doing different tasks Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others knowing its place on the assembly line And instead I wanted to ask How are the different task groups interdependent So I did experiments where I changed one thing So for example I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active This is what it looks like about  minutes later Here it is about  minutes later And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there And what I wanted to know was OK heres a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited  is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked So heres some blue nest maintenance workers And lately weve gotten more sophisticated and we have this threecolor system And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers and they work really well And so just to summarize the result well it turns out that yes the different tasks are interdependent So if I change the numbers performing one task it changes the numbers performing another So for example if I make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up then I see fewer ants out foraging And this was true for all the pairwise combinations of tasks And the second result which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks The same ant doesnt do the same task over and over its whole life So for example if I put out extra food everybody else  the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food they become foragers The nest maintenance workers become foragers The patrollers become foragers But not every transition is possible And this shows how it works Like I just said if there is more food to collect the patrollers the midden workers the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage If theres more patrolling to do  so I created a disturbance so extra patrollers were needed  the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol But if more nest maintenance work is needed  for example if I put out a bunch of toothpicks  then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest So foraging acts as a sink and the ants inside the nest act as a source And finally it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not So for example when theres extra nest maintenance work to do its not that the foragers switch over I know that they dont do that But the foragers somehow decide not to come out And here was the most intriguing result the task allocation This process changes with colony age and it changes like this When I do these experiments with older colonies  so ones that are five years or older  theyre much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic The worse things get the more I hassle them the more they act like undisturbed colonies Whereas the young small colonies  the twoyearold colonies of just  ants  are much more variable And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year It could be this year or this year So the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony Its not due to the experience of older wiser ants Instead something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older And the obvious thing thats changing is its size So since Ive had this result Ive spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules  very simple local probably olfactory chemical rules could an ant could be using since no ant can assess the global situation  that would have the outcome that I see these predictable dynamics in who does what task And it would change as the colony gets larger And what Ive found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact So anybody whos ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae They smell with their antennae When one ant touches another its smelling it and it can tell for example whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other through grooming with a layer of grease which carries a colonyspecific odor And what were learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks in deciding what to do And so what the message is is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another but the pattern The pattern itself is the message And Ill tell you a little bit more about that But first you might be wondering how is it that an ant can tell for example Im a forager I expect to meet another forager every so often But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers Im less likely to forage So it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker And weve learned that in this species  and I suspect in others as well  these hydrocarbons this layer of grease on the outside of ants is different as ants perform different tasks And weve done experiments that show that thats because the longer an ant stays outside the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks And they can use that taskspecific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons  they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which theyre meeting ants of certain tasks And weve just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it as they would to contact with real ants So I want now to show you a bit of film  and this will start out first of all showing you the nest entrance So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance Theyve gone out to do different tasks and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines or influences each ants decision about whether to go out and which task to perform This is taken through a fiber optics microscope Its down inside the nest In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope But the idea is that the ants are in there and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it  a stream of contacts with other ants And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out and what it does when it comes back out You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these Each ant then as it comes back in is contacting other ants And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip are contacting the ants coming in So whats interesting about this system is that its messy Its variable Its noisy And in particular in two ways The first is that the experience of the ant  of each ant  cant be very predictable Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside And the second thing is that an ants ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting So we do a lot of simulation and modeling and also experimental work to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to in the aggregate produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies Again I dont want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork In fact if you watch ants at all you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it So its not really that out of these haphazard contacts perfection arises But it works pretty well Ants have been around for several hundred million years They cover the earth except for Antarctica Something that theyre doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts in the aggregate produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants And one of the things that were studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns  this network of interaction patterns  to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies So the one thing though that I want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that youd expect to be closely connected to colony size The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony  and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule like I expect to meet another forager every three seconds But in a small colony its likely to meet fewer foragers just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet So this is the kind of rule that as the colony develops and gets older and larger will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

146,"Ive always wanted to be a cyborg One of my favorite shows as a kid
was The Six Million Dollar Man and this is a little bit closer
to the dollar man or so but  At any rate I would normally
feel very selfconscious and geeky wearing this around but a few days ago
I saw one worldrenowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here so I figure its OK amongst this group But thats not what I want
to talk about today I want to talk about toys
and the power that I see inherent in them When I was a kid
I attended Montessori school up to sixth grade in Atlanta Georgia And at the time
I didnt think much about it but then later I realized that that was
the high point of my education From that point on everything else
was pretty much downhill And it wasnt until later
as I started making games that  I really actually
think of them more as toys People call me a game designer but I really think
of these things more as toys I started getting very interested
in Maria Montessori and her methods and the way she went about things and the way she thought it
very valuable for kids to discover things on their own rather than being taught
these things overtly And she would design these toys
where kids in playing with the toys would come to understand
these deep principles of life and nature through play And since they discovered this
it stuck with them so much more and also they would experience
their own failures There was a failurebased aspect
to learning there It was very important And so the games that I do I think of really more
as modern Montessori toys And I really kind of want them
to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore
and discover their own principles So a few years ago I started getting very interested
in the SETI program And thats the way I work I get interested in different subjects
I dive in research them and then try to figure out
how to craft a toy around that so that other people can experience
the same sense of discovery that I did as I was learning that subject And it led me to astrobiology the study of possible life
in the universe And then Drakes equation looking at the probability
of life arising on planets how long it might last
how many planets are out there And I started looking
at how interesting Drakes equation was because it spanned
all these different subjects  physics chemistry
sociology economics astronomy And another thing that really
impressed me a long time ago was Powers of Ten
Charles and Ray Eames film And I started putting those two together
and wondering could I build a toy where kids would trip across
all these interesting principles of life as it exists and as it might
go in the future Things where you might trip across things like the Copernican principle
the Fermi paradox the anthropic principle
the origin of life And so Im going to show you a toy today
that Ive been working on that I think of more
as kind of a philosophy toy Playing this toy will bring up
philosophical questions in you The game is Spore
Ive been working on it for several years Its getting pretty close to finished now It occurs at all these different scales
from very small to very large Im going to pop in
at the start of the game And you actually start this game
in a drop of water as a very very small
singlecell creature and right off the bat you basically
just have to live survive reproduce So here we are
at a very microscopic scale swimming around And I actually realize
that cells dont have eyes but it helps to make it cute The players are going to play
through every generation of this species and as you play the game the creature is actually
growing bit by bit And as we start growing the camera will
actually start zooming out and things that you see
in the background there will start slowly
pulling into the foreground showing you a little bit of what
youll be interacting with as you grow So as we eat the camera
starts pulling out and then we start interacting
with larger and larger organisms We actually play
through many generations here at the cellular scale Im going to skip ahead here At some point we get larger and we actually get
to a macroevolution scale Now at this point
were leaving the water and one thing thats kind of important
about this game is that at every level the player is designing their creature and thats a fundamental aspect of this Now in the evolution game here
the creature scale basically you have to eat
survive and then reproduce You know very Darwinian One thing we noticed with The Sims
a game I did earlier is that players love making stuff When they were able
to make stuff in the game they had a lot of empathy
in connection to it Even if it wasnt as pretty as a professional artist
would make for games it really stuck with them and they really cared
about what would happen to it At this point weve left the water
and now with this little creature  we could bring up
the volume a little bit  and now we might try to eat We might sneak up
on this little guy over here maybe and try and eat him OK well we fight Creatures grunting OK we got him Now we get a meal So really at this part of the game what were doing is were
running around and surviving and also getting to the next generation because were going to play
through every generation of this creature We can mate so Im going to see if one of these creatures
wants to mate with me Yeah Creatures grunting We didnt want to replay
actual evolution with humans and all that because its almost more interesting to look at alternate
possibilities in evolution Evolution is usually presented
as this one path that we took through but really it represents
this huge set of possibilities Now once we mate we click on the egg And this is where the game
starts getting interesting because one of the things
we really focused on here was giving the players
very highleverage tools so that for very little effort
the player can make something very cool And it involves a lot
of intelligence on the tool side But basically this is the editor where were going to design
the next generation So it has a little spine
I can move around I can extend I can also inflate or deflate it
with the mouse wheel so you sculpt it like clay We have parts here
that I can put on or pull off The idea is that the player
can basically design anything they can think of in this editor and well basically bring it to life So I might put some limbs
on the character here Ill inflate them kind of large And in this case
I might decide Im going to put  Ill put mouths on the limbs So pretty much players are encouraged
to be very creative in the game Here Ill give it one eye in the middle
maybe scale it up a bit Point it down And Ill also give it a few legs So in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier
for the players imagination so that with a very small number of clicks
a player can create something that they didnt really think
was possible before This is almost like designing
something like Maya  that an eightyearold can use But really the goal here was within about a minute
I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist
several weeks to create OK now Ill put some hands on it OK so here Ive basically
thrown together a little creature Let me give it a little weapon
on the tail here so it can fight OK so thats the complete model Now we can actually
go to the painting phase At this phase the program
has some understanding of the topology of this creature It knows where the backbone is
where the spine the limbs are how stripes should run
how it should be shaded And so were procedurally
generating the texture map something a texture artist
would take many days to work on And then we can test it out
and see how it would move around And so at this point the computer
is procedurally animating this creature Its looking at whatever Ive designed
It will actually bring it to life And I can see how it might dance How it might show emotions
how it might fight So its acting with its two mouths there I can even have it pose for a photo Snap a little photo of it So then I bring this back into the game Its born and I play the next generation
of my creature through evolution Now again the empathy
that the players have when they create
the content is tremendous When players create content in this game
its automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed
to all the other players transparently So in fact as Im interacting
in this world with other creatures these creatures are transparently
coming from other players as they play So the process of playing the game is a process of building up
this huge database of content And pretty much everything
youre going to see in this game theres an editor for
that the player can create up through civilization This is my baby When I eat
Ill actually start growing This is the next generation
But Im going to skip ahead here Normally what would happen is
these creatures would work their way up eventually become intelligent Id start dealing with tribes cities
and civilizations of them over time Im going to skip way ahead
to the space phase Eventually they would go out into space and start colonizing
and exploring the universe Now really in some sense I want the players to be building
this world in their imagination and then extracting it from them
with the least amount of pain So thats kind of
what these tools are about How do we make the gameplay you know basically
the players imagination amplifier And how do we make
these tools these editors something that are just as fun
as the game itself So this is the planet
that weve been playing on up to this point in the game So far the entire game has been played
on the surface of this little world here At this point were actually
dealing with a very little toy planet Almost again
like the Montessori toy idea What happens if you give
somebody a toy planet and let them play
with a lot of dynamics on it What could they discover
What might they learn on this This world was actually extracted
from the players imagination So this is the planet
that the player evolved on Things like the buildings the vehicles
the architecture civilizations were all designed by the player
up to this point So heres a little city with some
of our guys walking around in it And most games put the player
in the role of Luke Skywalker this protagonist
playing through this story This is more about putting the player
in the role of George Lucas I want them after theyve
played this game to have extracted an entire world
that theyre now interacting with As we pull down here we still have a whole set of creatures
living on the surface of the planet All these different
dynamics going on here I can look over here and this is
a little simplified food web thats going on with the creatures I can open this up and then scan
what exists on the surface You get some sense of the diversity
of creatures that were brought in Some of these were created by the player others by other players
automatically sent over here But theres a very simple
calculation of whats required how many plants are required
for the herbivores to live how many herbivores
for the carnivores to eat etc that you have to balance actively Also with this phase were getting more and more
Godlike powers for the player and you can experiment
with this planet as a toy So I can come in and I can do things and just treat this planet
as a lump of clay We have very simple
weather systems simple geology For instance I could open one of my tools
here and then carve out rivers So this whole thing is kind of
like a big lump of clay a sculpture I can also play with the dynamics
in this world over time So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO gases
into the atmosphere and so thats what Im doing here Theres actually
a little readout down there of our planetary atmosphere
pressure and temperature So as I start pumping in more atmosphere were going to start pushing up
the greenhouse gases here and if youll start noticing we start seeing
the ocean levels rise over time And our cities
are going to be at risk too because a lot of these are coastal cities You can see the ocean levels
are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities
Ill start losing cities here So basically I want the players
to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space So there goes one city Now over time this is
going to heat up the planet So at first what were going to see is a global ocean rise
here on this little toy planet but then over time 
I can speed it up  well see the heat impact of that as well Not only will it get hotter but at some point its going to get so hot
the oceans will evaporate Theyll go up and then theyll evaporate
and thatll be my planet So basically what were getting here is the sequel to An Inconvenient Truth
in about two minutes and that actually brings up
an interesting point about games Now here our entire oceans
are evaporating off the surface and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet
is going to melt down Here it goes So were not only
simulating biological dynamics  food webs and all that  but also geologic you know
on a very simple core scale And whats interesting to me about games is that I think we can take
a lot of longterm dynamics and compress them
into very shortterm experiences Because its so hard for people
to think  or  years out but when you can give them a toy and they can experience these
longterm dynamics in just a few minutes I think its an entirely
different point of view where were actually using the game
to remap our intuition Its almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope
recalibrates your eyesight I think computer simulations
can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time So heres our little solar system as we pull away
from our melted planet here We actually have a couple
of other planets in this solar system Lets fly to another one Were going to have this unlimited
number of worlds you can explore here As we move into the future and we start going out
into space and doing stuff were drawing a lot
from things like science fiction And all my favorite science fiction movies I want to play out here
as different dynamics This planet actually has some life on it Here it is some indigenous
life down here One of the tools
I can eventually earn for my UFO is a monolith that I can drop down Now as you can see these guys are actually
starting to go up and bow to it and over time once they touch it
they will become intelligent So I can actually
pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient Now theyve actually
gone to tribal dynamics And now because
Im actually the one here I can get out of the UFO and walk up and they should be worshipping me
at this point as a god At first theyre a little freaked out OK well maybe theyre not worshipping me I think Ill leave
before they get hostile But we basically want
a diversity of activities the players can play through this I want to be able to play The Day the Earth Stood Still
 A Space Odyssey Star Trek War Of the Worlds Now as we pull away from this world  were going to keep
pulling away from the star now One of the things that always
frustrated me about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented
so twodimensionally and so static As we pull away from the star here were actually going now
out into interstellar space and were getting a sense
of the space around our home star What I really wanted to do
is to present this basically as wonderfully D as it is actually is And also show the dynamics and a lot of the interesting objects
that you might find like in the Hubble at pretty much realistic
frequencies and scales So most people
have no idea of the difference between an emission nebula
and a planetary nebula But these are the things that we can put
in this little galaxy here So were flying over here
to what looks like a black hole I want to basically have
the entire zoo of Hubble objects that people can interact with
and play with again as toys So heres a little black hole that we probably
dont want to get too close to But we also have stars and things as well If we pull all the way back
we start seeing the entire galaxy here kind of slowly in motion Typically when people present galaxies its always beautiful photos
but theyre always static And when you bring it forward in time
and start animating it its amazing what a galaxy
would look like fast forwarded This would be about
a million years a second because you have about
one supernova every century And so youd have
this wonderful sparkling thing with the disk slowly rotating and this is roughly
what it would look like Part of this is about bringing
the beauty of the natural world to somebody in a very imaginative way so that they can start
calibrating their instinct across these vast scales
of space and time Chris was wondering what kind of gods
the players would become Because if you think about it youre going to have yearolds
yearolds flying around this universe They might be a nurturing god They might be bootstrapping
life on planets trying to terraform
and spread civilization You might be a vengeful god conquesting because you actually can do that
you can attack other intelligent races You might be a networking god
building alliances or just curious going around and wanting
to explore as much as you possibly can But basically the reason
why I make toys like this is because I think
if theres one difference I could possibly make in the world that I would choose to make its that I would like
to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration
on longterm thinking Because I think most of the problems
that our world is facing right now are the result of shortterm thinking and the fact that it is so hard for us
to think   or  years out And I think by giving kids toys like this
and letting them replay dynamics very longterm dynamics
over the short term and getting some sense
of what were doing now what its going to be like in  years I think probably is the most effective
thing I can be doing to help the world And so thats why I think
that toys can change the world Thank you ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

147,Im a medical illustrator and I come from a slightly different point of view Ive been watching since I grew up the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences And while these are both wonderful things in their own right  they both have very wonderful things going for them  truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date These are expressions of truth as awefull things by meaning they are things you can worship They are ideals that are powerful They are irreducible They are unique They are useful  sometimes often a long time after the fact And you can actually roll some of the pictures now because I dont want to look at me on the screen Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences They are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed If you look at the math Emc squared if you look at the cosmological constant where theres an anthropic ideal where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe  these are things that are really difficult to understand And what Ive tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator  since I was taught animation by my father who was a sculptor and my visual mentor  I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation by using pictures by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth and can be taught and can be understood Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them but the way theyre taught is compartmentalized and its drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident Its almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone We dont want to do that to our students So we have an opportunity to really open up education And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department a couple of years ago He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell  that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on They could have a mental image of the cell as a large bustling hugely complicated city thats occupied by micromachines And these micromachines really are at the heart of life These micromachines which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over are selfdirected powerful precise accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids And these micromachines power how a cell moves They power how a cell replicates They power our hearts They power our minds And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will  in addition to all the textual information in addition to all the didactic stuff  put everything together visually so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty and be able to study with this view in mind so that their imaginations would be sparked so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out really how life works So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together We worked with a theme which is youve got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary and theyre touching the surface of the capillary wall and theyre picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall and they are given this information that theres an inflammation somewhere outside where they cant see and sense But they get the information that causes them to stop causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape and try to get out of this capillary and find out whats going on So these molecular motors  we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved and figure out what they did And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening And so what Im going to show you is a threeminute Readers Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced Its an ongoing project thats going to go another four or five years And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures  these little walking machines theyre called kinesins  that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size Run the movie please But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other They pass information to each other They cause different things to happen inside the cell And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly from information thats brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes No life from the smallest life to everybody here would be possible without these little micromachines In fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here Chris really quite sparse Music This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell This little guy is called the kinesin and he pulls a sack thats full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever its needed in the cell  whether its to a membrane whether its to an organelle whether its to build something or repair something And each of us has about  of these things running around right now inside each one of your  trillion cells So no matter how lazy you feel youre not really intrinsically doing nothing So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this and think about how powerful our cells are And think about some of the things that were learning about cellular mechanics Once we figure out all thats going on  and believe me we know almost a percent of whats going on  once we figure out whats going on were really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health with what we do with future generations and how long were going to live And hopefully well be able to use this to discover more truth and more beauty Music But its really quite amazing that these cells these micromachines are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding They work together They make the cell do what it needs to do And their working together helps our bodies  huge entities that they will never see  function properly Enjoy the rest of the show Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

148,This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times The punch line On the other hand I dont have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Labrador This is a recent cover of New York Magazine Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment births strokes heart disease hip replacements  am emergencies And this is a song medley I put together  Music Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour A time for inconveniences mishaps yearnings A time for plotting to whack the chief of police like in this classic scene from The Godfather Coppolas script describes these guys as exhausted in shirt sleeves It is four in the morning A time for even grimmer stuff than that like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allendes The House of the Spirits After the breathtaking greenhaired Rosa is murdered the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians paste They worked until four oclock in the morning A time for even grimmer stuff than that like in last Aprils New Yorker magazine This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out On September   he opened his eyes at  am in Portland Maine and Mohamed Attas last day began For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press  across a lot of different media from a lot of big names And it made me suspicious I figured surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world really arent all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it right Could it be there is something more going on here Something deliberate something secret and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway I say this guy  Alberto Giacometti shown here with some of his sculptures on the Swiss  franc note He did it with this famous piece from the New York Museum of Modern Art Its title  The Palace at Four in the Morning   Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find I believe that this socalled first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it I call this The Giacometti Code a TED exclusive No feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if youve got them It works a little something like  this is a recent Google search for four in the morning Results vary of course This is pretty typical The top  results yield you four hits for Faron Youngs song Its Four in the Morning three hits for Judi Denchs film Four in the Morning one hit for Wislawa Szymborskas poem Four in the Morning But what you may ask do a Polish poet a British Dame a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking Well lets start with Faron Young  who was born incidentally in  In  he shot himself in the head on December ninth  which incidentally is Judi Denchs birthday But he didnt die on Denchs birthday He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly selfinflicted gunshot wound at the age of   which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this She has the worlds most absolutely watertight alibi On that very day December   while Mr Four in the Morning Faron Young was giving up the ghost in Nashville Tennessee Ms Four in the Morning  or one of them anyway  Wislawa Szymborska was in Stockholm Sweden accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature  years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself Coincidence No its creepy Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric Thats like me telling you Hey you know the Nobel Prize was established in  which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born No not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm but that does not mean theres not something going on at the highest possible levels In fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip were about to see Video Homer Simpson We have a tennis court a swimming pool a screening room  You mean if I want pork chops even in the middle of the night your guy will fry them up Herbert Powell Sure thats what hes paid for Now do you need towels laundry maids HS Wait wait wait wait wait wait  let me see if I got this straight It is Christmas Day  am Theres a rumble in my stomach Marge Simpson Homer please Rives Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait Let me see if I got this straight Matt When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock but the whole freaking calendar he comes up with  on the birthday of the Baby Jesus And no I dont know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things but obviously I know a coded message when I see one I said I know a coded message when I see one And folks you can buy a copy of Bill Clintons My Life from the bookstore here at TED Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt And how far down into it you figure well have to scroll to get to the golden ticket Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs This is page  on your paperbacks if youre following along Though it was getting better I still wasnt satisfied with the inaugural address My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day I was still changing it Sure you were because youve prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you And then  three paragraphs later we get this little beauty We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time It had gotten a lot better since  am Well how could it have By his own writing this man was either asleep at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase What happens to American presidents at  on inauguration day What happened to William Jefferson Clinton We might not ever know And I noticed hes not exactly around here today to face any tough questions It could get awkward right I mean after all this whole business happened on his watch But if he were here  he might remind us as he does in the wrapup to his fine autobiography that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey  a journey that saw him go on to become the first Democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades In generations The first since this man Franklin Delano Roosevelt who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election way back in a simpler time way back in   the year Alberto Giacometti made The

149,Allison Hunt My three minutes hasnt started yet has it Chris Anderson No you cant start the three minutes Reset the three minutes thats just not fair AH Oh my God its harsh up here I mean Im nervous enough as it is But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery Do you know that surgery Electric saw power drill totally disgusting unless youre David Bolinsky in which case its all truth and beauty Sure David if its not your hip its truth and beauty Anyway I did have a really big epiphany around the situation so Chris invited me to tell you about it But first you need to know two things about me Just two things Im Canadian and Im the youngest of seven kids Now in Canada we have that great healthcare system That means we get our new hips for free And being the youngest of seven I have never been at the front of the line for anything OK So my hip had been hurting me for years I finally went to the doctor which was free And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon also free Finally got to see him after  months of waiting  almost a year That is what free gets you I met the surgeon and he took some free Xrays and I got a good look at them And you know even I could tell my hip was bad and I actually work in marketing So he said Allison weve got to get you on the table Im going to replace your hip  its about an month wait  more months Id already waited  months and I had to wait  more months You know its such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs I wouldnt have my new hip for this TED I wouldnt have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa I would not have my new hip for TED I would still be on my bad hip That was so disappointing So I left his office and I was walking through the hospital and thats when I had my epiphany This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line Oh yeah Can I tell you how unCanadian that is We do not think that way We dont talk about it Its not even a consideration In fact when were traveling abroad its how we identify fellow Canadians After you Oh no no After you Hey are you from Canada Oh me too Hi Great Excellent So no suddenly I wasnt averse to butting any geezer off the list Some yearold who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing or gardening No no Front of the line So by now I was walking the lobby and of course that hurt because of my hip and I kind of needed a sign And I saw a sign In the window of the hospitals tiny gift shop there was a sign that said Volunteers Needed Hmm Well they signed me up immediately No reference checks None of the usual background stuff no They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was  Yeah They needed some young blood So next thing you know I had my bright blue volunteer vest I had my photo ID and I was fully trained by my yearold boss I worked alone Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop While ringing in hospital staffs Tic Tacs Id casually ask What do you do Then Id tell them Well Im getting my hip replaced  in  months Its gonna be so great when the pain stops Ow All the staff got to know the plucky young volunteer My next surgeons appointment was coincidentally right after a shift at the gift shop So naturally I had my vest and my identification I draped them casually over the chair in the doctors office And you know when he walked in I could just tell that he saw them Moments later I had a surgery date just weeks away and a big fat prescription for Percocet Now word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line And you know Im not even ashamed of that Two reasons First of all I am going to take such good care of this new hip But also I intend to stick with the volunteering which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all Even when a Canadian cheats the system they do it in a way that benefits society ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

151,Well first of all let me thank Emeka  as a matter of fact TED Global  for putting this conference together This conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the st century Think African governments will put together a conference like this You think the AU will put together a conference like this Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows June Arunga James Shikwati Andrew and the other TED Fellows I call them the Cheetah Generation The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption They understand what accountability and democracy is Theyre not going to wait for government to do things for them Thats the Cheetah Generation and Africas salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs In contrast of course we have the Hippo Generation The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites They are stuck in their intellectual patch Complaining about colonialism and imperialism they wouldnt move one foot If you ask them to reform the economies theyre not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo Now there are a lot of Africans who are very angry angry at the condition of Africa Now were talking about a continent that is not poor It is rich in mineral resources natural mineral resources But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty Thats what makes a lot of Africans very angry And in a way Africa is more than a tragedy in more ways than one Theres another enduring tragedy and that tragedy is that there are so many people so many governments so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa They dont understand Now were not saying dont help Africa Helping Africa is noble But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd Its like the blind leading the clueless There are certain things that we need to recognize Africas beggingbowl leaks Did you know that  percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa Its taken out of Africa Thats what the World Bank says Look at Africas beggingbowl It leaks horribly There are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks What are the leakages Corruption alone costs Africa  billion dollars a year Yes put that aside Capital flight out of Africa  billion a year Put that aside Lets take food imports Every year Africa spends  billion dollars to import food Just add that up all these leakages Thats far more than the  billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa Now back in the s Africa not only fed itself it also exported food Not anymore We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong You know it I know it but lets not waste our time talking about these mistakes because well spend all day here Lets move on and flip over to the next chapter and thats what this conference is all about  the next chapter The next chapter begins with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question Whom do we want to help in Africa There is the people and then there is the government or leaders Now the previous speaker before me Idris Mohammed indicated that weve had abysmal leadership in Africa That characterization in my view is even more charitable I belong to an Internet discussion forum an African Internet discussion forum and I asked them I said Since  weve had exactly  African heads of state since  And I asked them to name me just  good leaders just  good leaders  you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself I asked them to name me just  Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela of course Kwame Nkrumah Nyerere Kenyatta  somebody mentioned Idi Amin I let that pass My point is they couldnt go beyond  Even if they had been able to name me  what does that tell you  out of  means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people And if you look at them the slate of the postcolonial leaders  an assortment of military fufu heads Swissbank socialists crocodile liberators vampire elites quack revolutionaries Now this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries The second false premise that we make when were trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people serves the interests of the people and represents the people There is one particular quote  a Lesotho chief once said that Here in Lesotho weve got two problems rats and the government What you and I understand as a government doesnt exist in many African countries In fact what we call our governments are vampire states Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people Government is the problem in Africa A vampire state is the government   which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies and tribesmen and exclude everybody else The richest people in Africa are headsofstate and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the headofstate himself Where do they get their money By creating wealth No By raking it off the backs of their suffering people Thats not wealth creation Its wealth redistribution The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people we must know where the African people are Take any African economy An African economy can be broken up into three sectors There is the modern sector there is the informal sector and the traditional sector The modern sector is the abode of the elites Its the seat of government In many African countries the modern sector is lost Its dysfunctional It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves dont understand That is the source of many of Africas problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector claiming innocent lives Now the modern sector of course is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into More than  percent of Ivory Coasts development went into the modern sector The other sectors the informal and the traditional sectors are where you find the majority of the African people the real people in Africa Thats where you find them Now obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people you go where the people are But thats not what we did As a matter of fact we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors Now traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture which is one of the reasons why Africa cant feed itself and thats why it must import food All right you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors And you cant develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work These two sectors let me describe to you have their own indigenous institutions First one is the political system Traditionally Africans hate governments They hate tyranny If you look into their traditional systems Africans organize their states in two types The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous so they didnt want to have anything to do with any centralized authority These societies are the Ibo the Somali the Kikuyus for example They have no chiefs The other ethnic groups which did have chiefs made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power In Ashanti tradition for example the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders Without the council the chief cant pass any law and if the chief doesnt govern according to the will of the people he will be removed If not the people will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up a new settlement And even if you look in ancient African empires they were all organized around one particular principle  the confederacy principle which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority decentralization of power Now this is what I have described to you This is part of Africas indigenous political heritage Now compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on Africa It is a total far cry In the economic system in traditional Africa the means of production is privately owned Its owned by extended families You see in the West the basic economic and social unit is the individual The American will say I am because I am and I can damn well do anything I want anytime The accent is on the I In Africa the Africans say I am because we are The we connotes community  the extended family system The extended family system pools its resources together They own farms They decide what to do what to produce They dont take any orders from their chiefs They decide what to do And when they produce their crops they sell the surplus on marketplaces When they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from them So in a nutshell what we had in traditional Africa was a freemarket system There were markets in Africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent Timbuktu was one great big market town Kano Salaga  they were all there Even if you go to West Africa you notice that market activity in West Africa has always been dominated by women So its quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace The market is not alien to Africa What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism but then after independence all of a sudden markets capitalism became a western institution and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism Nonsense And even then what kind of socialism did they practice The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of Swissbank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder Africas treasuries for deposit in Switzerland That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries What do we do now Go back to Africas indigenous institutions and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors the traditional sectors Thats where you find the African people And Id like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector about the boatbuilding that I myself tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora to invest in Could you please show that The men are going fishing in these small boats Yes its an enterprise This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur using his own capital Hes getting no assistance from the government and hes building a second bigger boat A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians It also means that he will be able to generate wealth And then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy All that you need to do all that the elites need to do is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient Now it is not just this informal sector There is also traditional medicine  percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed Now this is an area  I mean there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area This is where we need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora especially to invest in this We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora not only to go into the traditional sectors but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana And I know that with the Cheetahs we can take Africa back one village at a time Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

152,Its very very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this because everyone has spoken Everything has been said So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away and take forward and work on Thats what Id like to try and do We came here saying we want to talk about Africa the Next Chapter But we are talking about Africa the Next Chapter because we are looking at the old and the present chapter  that were looking at and saying its not such a good thing The picture I showed you before and this picture of drought death and disease is what we usually see What we want to look at is Africa the Next Chapter and thats this a healthy smiling beautiful African And I think its worth remembering what weve heard through the conference right from the first day where I heard that all the important statistics have been given  about where we are now about how the continent is doing much better And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on So Im not going to spend too much time  just to show you refresh your memories that we are here for Africa the Next Chapter because for the first time there really is a platform to build on We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen After decades of  percent we are now at  percent and its going to  projected   and  percent even And inflation has come down External debt  something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent  has come down dramatically You know as you can see from almost  billion down to about  or  billion Now this is a huge achievement You know weve built up reserves Why is that important Its because it shows off our economies shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build including businesses Weve also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased I want to remind you again  I know you saw these statistics before  from almost  billion we are now at about  billion In  remittances  I just took one country Nigeria skyrocketing  skyrocketing is too dramatic but increasing dramatically And in many other countries this is happening Why is this important Because it shows confidence People are now confident to bring  if your people in the diaspora bring their money back it shows other people that look there is emerging confidence in your country And instead of an outflow you are now getting a net inflow Now why is all this important to have to go really fast Its important that we build this platform that we have the president Kikwete and others of our leaders who are saying Look we must do something different Because we are confronted with a challenge  percent of our population is below the age of  What does this mean This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives You have to focus on how to create jobs make sure they dont fall into disease and that they get an education But most of all that they are productively engaged in life and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen And to support this I just recently  one of the things Ive done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria Most of our countries dont even have any opinion research People dont have voice There is no way you can know what people want One of the things we asked them recently was whats their top issue Like in every other country where this has been done jobs is the top issue I want to leave this up here and come back to it But before I get to this slide I just wanted to run you through this And to say that for me the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward  and we mustnt make light of it It was only    years ago we couldnt even talk about the next chapter because we were in the old chapter We were going nowhere The economies were not growing We were having negative per capita growth The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there So lets not forget that its taken a lot to build this including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to Creating our own program to solve problems like fighting corruption building institutions stabilizing the micro economy So now we have this platform we can build on And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here aid versus private sector aid versus trade etc And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that its been a simplistic debate And thats not what the debate should be about Thats engaging in the wrong debate The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives How do we combine all this To move our continent forward to do the things that need doing that I talked about  getting young people employed Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent much of what you have seen here So Im afraid weve been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate We need to bring it back to say what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want Applause And I want to tell you something For me the issue about aid  I dont think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid Africa has been giving the other countries aid Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid And I said Mo youre right We have  no but weve already been doing it The UK and the US could not have been built today without Africas aid It is all the resources that were taken from Africa including human that built these countries today So when they try to give back we shouldnt be on the defensive The issue is not that The issue is how are we using what has been given back How are we using it Is it being directed effectively I want to tell you a little story Why I dont mind if we get aid but we use it well From  to  Nigeria fought a war  the NigeriaBiafra war And in the middle of that war I was  years old We spent much of our time with my mother cooking For the army  my father joined the army as a brigadier  the Biafran army We were on the Biafran side And we were down to eating one meal a day running from place to place but wherever we could help we did At a certain point in time in  things were really bad We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day People children were dying of kwashiorkor Im sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures Well I was in the middle of it In the midst of all this my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days We thought she was going to die My father was not there He was in the army So I was the oldest person in the house My sister fell very ill with malaria She was three years old and I was  And she had such a high fever We tried everything It didnt look like it was going to work Until we heard that  kilometers away there was a doctor who was looking at people and giving them meds Now I put my sister on my back  burning  and I walked  kilometers with her strapped on my back It was really hot I was very hungry I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people I walked  kilometers putting one foot in front of the other I got there and I saw huge crowds Almost a thousand people were there trying to break down the door She was doing this in a church How was I going to get in I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back find a way to a window And while they were trying to break down the door I climbed in through the window and jumped in This woman told me it was in the nick of time By the time we jumped into that hall she was barely moving She gave a shot of her chloroquine  what I learned was the chloroquine then  gave her some  it must have been a rehydration  and some other therapies and put us in a corner In about two to three hours she started to move And then they toweled her down because she started sweating which was a good sign And then my sister woke up And about five or six hours later she said we could go home I strapped her on my back I walked the  kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had I was so happy  Applause  that my sister was alive Today shes  years old a mother of three and shes a physician saving other lives Why am I telling that Im telling you that because  when it is you or your person involved  you dont care where  whether its aid You dont care what it is Applause You just want the person to be alive And now let me become less sentimental and say that saving lives  which some of the aid we get does on this continent  when you save the life of anyone a farmer a teacher a mother they are contributing productively into the economy And as an economist we can also look at that side of the story These are people who are productive agents in the economy So if we save people from HIVAIDS if we save them from malaria it means they can form the base of production for our economy And by the same token  as someone said yesterday  if we dont and they die their children will become a burden on the economy So even from an economic standpoint if we leave the social and the humanitarian we need to save lives now So thats one of the reasons from a personal experience that I say lets channel these resources we get into something productive However I will also tell you that Im one of those who doesnt believe that this is the sole answer Thats why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated You know we have to use it well What has happened in Europe Do you all know that Spain  part of the EU  got  billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU Resources that were transferred to them  and were the Spanish ashamed of this No The EU transferred  billion Where did they use it Have you been to southern Spain lately There are roads everywhere Infrastructure everywhere It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy Did you know that Ireland got  billion dollars in aid Ireland is one of the fastestgrowing economies in the European Union today For which many people even from other parts of the world are going there to find jobs What did they do with the  billion dollars in aid They used it to build an information superhighway gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution and to create jobs in their economy They didnt say No you know were not going to take this Today the European Union is busy transferring aid My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain  which is roads highways other things that they can build  I say then why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries Applause When we ask them and tell them what we need one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now Now we talk about the World Bank IMF and accountability all that and the EU We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money  some of them in this audience with private foundations And one day these foundations have so much money they will overtake the official aid that is being given But I fear  and Im very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent  but Im also worried I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent And theyre also going from country to country and many times trying to find what to do But Im not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way And many of them are not really familiar with the continent They are just discovering And many times I dont see Africans working with them They are just going alone Applause And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know They want to visit us see whats happening on the ground and make a decision And now Im maybe being harsh But I worry because this money is so important Now who are they accountable to Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money Are we there Will we make the same mistake that we made before Have our presidents and our leaders  everyone is talking about  have they ever called these people together and said Look your foundation and your foundation  you have so much money we are grateful Lets sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go Have we done that The answer is no And each one is making their own individual effort And then  years from now billions will again have gone into Africa and we would still have the same problems This is what gives us the hopeless image Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money Sit down And we dont do it because there are so many of us We dont coordinate Weve not called the Bill Gates and the Soros and everybody else who is helping and say Sit down Lets have a conference with you As a continent here are our priorities Here is where we want you to channel this money Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best Were not trying to stop them at all But to help them help us better And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this Ten years from now we will have the same story and we will be repeating the same things So our problem right now is how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations with the international organizations and with our private sector I firmly believe in that private sector thing too But it cannot do it alone So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas So why dont we think of using some of this aid Well why dont we first say to those helping us out Dont be shy about infrastructure That health that youre working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure That education will work better if weve got electricity and railroads and so on That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market Dont be shy of it Invest some of your resources in that too And then we can see that this is one combination of private international multilateral money private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership so that aid can be a facilitator That is all aid can be Aid cannot solve our problems Im firmly convinced about that But it can be catalytic And if we fail to use it as catalytic we would have failed One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now  one of the reasons is not only just that you know these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources Its because theres a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese If you tell them We need a road here they will help you build it They dont shy away from infrastructure In fact the Chinese minister of finance said to me when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria He said There are two things you need only Infrastructure infrastructure infrastructure and discipline You are undisciplined Applause And I repeat it for the continent Its the same We need infrastructure infrastructure and discipline So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that Now I realize  Im not saying  health and education  no you can also provide that as well But Im saying its not either or Lets see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership One idea Second thing for the private sector people are afraid to take risks on the continent Why cant some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms to enable people to take risk And finally because they are both standing at my  Im out of time Am I out of time OK so let me not forget my punchline One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women to create jobs Applause A lot has been said here about women I dont need to repeat it But there are people  women  creating jobs And we know studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman  in fact theres an econometric study the World Bank Review done in  showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children more for the household more for the economy and all that So Im saying that one of the takeaways from here  Im not saying the men are not important  obviously if you leave the husbands out what will they do Theyll come back home and get disgruntled and it will result in difficulties we dont want We dont want men beating their wives because they dont have a job and so on But at the margin we also  I want to push this because the reason is the men automatically  they get  not automatically but they tend to get more support But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool There are people creating jobs Beatrice Gakuba has created  jobs from her flower business in Rwanda We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria with the chair company She wants to expand She needs another  million She will create another   more jobs So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready  business people who want to expand and create more jobs And lastly what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid government private sector and the African as an individual Thank you Applause ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

154,Welcome to Africa Or rather I should say welcome home Because this is where it all really began isnt it Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years  it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here We are on an amazing journey the next four days Youre going to hear stories of Africa The Next Chapter Fantastic tales anecdotes from speakers But I want to turn that upside down for a moment and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say Whats the worst thing youve ever heard about Africa And this is not a rhetorical question I actually want answers from you Go for it The worst Famine Corruption More Genocide AIDS Slavery Thats enough Weve all heard these things But this is about Africa the story we have not heard The stories that we want to know and the stories that do exist about positive tales A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent to separate the rhetoric from the reality the fact from the fiction To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you So lets get going because Africa to some degree is on a turnaround A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image and how it takes control of its own destiny And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career And it all started almost a decade ago as a young consultant at McKinsey amp Company at their first African office in Johannesburg And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues and African companies on turnarounds making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States It all began with a fantastic phone call It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine And she said I want to write a case Euvin  a case on a publicsector leader that has lessons for the corporate world And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela Because Nelson Mandela as he took over power as the first democraticallyelected president of South Africa faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle Now the case Nelson Mandela Change Leader became part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeths new book called Confidence And Confidence became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Weeks hardcover bestseller list And why I tell you this story is because later when I was interviewed on SABC Africa on a panAfrican broadcast they asked What is your key lesson or the key thing you enjoy the most  because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project The lesson from that was that it was Africa  an African story  that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds Africa was being used as a success story So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation And that has to do with me because in  I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career You should have seen my parents reaction But very soon I found myself from the southern part of Africa in South Africa  at the very north in Egypt And I sought out the most remote places I went to the Siwa Oasis That was one of my stops And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle and it foretold his destiny of greatness This was  BC So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers Now the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night With no natural light source Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry Fast forward to  Im sitting in Cambridge Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference And I see the same picture but from the opposite side A satellite picture looking down at the earth And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because Ill never forget it I remember the very moment And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point The first thing that I saw was North America at night  glowing in all its glory A warm feeling Light And then I saw it  Africa Quite literally the Dark Continent And while Africa may be dark the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing but its also the opportunity Because whilst Africa may be dark  other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas  its aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there Entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope It was George Kimble the geographer who said that The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it So lets start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer Lets start unpacking it Africa is the secondlargest continent a landmass second from Asia It also is the second most populated continent with  million people In fact  coming back to the land mass  Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States China and the entire Europe into Africa and still have space Africa is home to over  languages   is another estimate thats out there  with over  languages and dialects But you could say Invest in Africa in over  languages and it wouldnt make a difference What does the data say As an investment banker Im in the crossflow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals or signs and winds of change that are sweeping this continent So lets start on that And lets start at the high level on the macrofactors Inflation in general is coming down across Africa  thats the first sign  in many countries reaching doubledigit figures So lets start looking at some of those I call it my ZEN cluster Zambia from  to  moves from the  percent in inflation to the nine percent Egypt from the  percent to about  percent Nigeria a similar situation from the  percent to the eight percent Single digits More fascinating you have other countries  South Africa Mauritius Namibia  all in single digits But thats just part of the story You have a similar trend with currencies  currencies going through an extreme time of stability But thats looking at the big picture And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country Its made up  Its made up of  different countries So the very definition  to say invest in Africa is a nogo Its meaningless Each country has a unique value proposition You can make money you can lose money in Africa But opportunities boy oh boy they exist And this is what today is about  its about discussing those very opportunities So lets start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data I was recently elected as Emeka mentioned as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America And Im very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in To hear this dialogue thats just increasing in tenor and velocity of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come So the first port of call lets talk a little bit about South Africa But not the South Africa we always talk about  the gold the minerals the First World infrastructure  a bit about the other side of it For example South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top  UK companies for offshore callcenters Same language timeline et cetera Makes sense Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR the big boys of private equity Headline in South Africa They have landed Quite ominous But what were they there for To acquire assets Bing Capitals acquisition of Edcon a large retailer is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy Because it is actually a longterm play Being a retailer it is a play on the belief that this middleclass thats growing will continue to grow that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue But the story of Africa and my focus is beyond South Africa because theres so much happening Undoubtedly Nigeria is clearly a hot spot Challenges  and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days But looking at Goldman Sachs work  we had the famous BRIC Report The new report The Next Eleven highlights that by  Nigeria is going to be amongst the top  economies in the world Its an investment opportunity Think about that Is anyone  our banks our investors  seriously thinking about going to Nigeria If you havent why not Whats going on in Nigeria A couple of things I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets Bellwether signs again Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa and this excludes South Africa But the first Eurobond the raising of international capital offshore off its own balance sheet without any sovereign backing  that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy Without any sovereign backing a Nigerian company raising capital offshore Its just a sign of things to come Looking at the oil industry Africa provides  percent of the USs oil supply with the Middle East just  percent Its an important strategic partner Lets put Nigeria in perspective  to  million barrels of oil a day  the same league as Kuwait the same league as Venezuela But with Africa lets start being careful about this And Emeka and I have had these discussions We have to move away from whats called the curse of the commodities Because its not about oil its not about commodities For Africa to truly be sustainable we have to move beyond to other industries So lets unpack those very quickly and Im going to move through these very very very fast because I can see that clock counting down What else is going on there Egypt Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone   billion investment The announcement just came out the last few weeks Close to the Mediterranean near Alexandria  textiles petrochemicals Its being managed by a Singaporeanbased management company So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries  away from oil Lets look at agriculture Lets look at forestry Whats going on there In Tanzania last week we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard Again gathering together farmers gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce Better prices It ties in with smallscale farmers in terms of no pesticides no fertilizers Again opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price Uganda the New Forest Company replanting and redeveloping their forests Why is that important As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed we will need poles for rolling out electricity But here is the sweetener in the deal Theyre going to be tapping into carbon credits Lets go back to Nigeria The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation from over  banks to  banks Strengthening of the system But whats going on there Only  percent of the country is banked The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria  millionplus people Think about that There are only  ATMs in the country Opportunity The same for telecoms across the country Now lets look at the continent as a whole People look at the roads for example and theyd say Angola  percent of roads are untarred Ah problem Its more expensive to transport goods Prices of goods go up inflation is affected Nigeria  percent of roads are untarred Zambia  percent In general more than  percent of roads are untarred This is an opportunity Energy needs  its an opportunity So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing Lets look at the stock markets in Africa If I had to ask you In  what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world Would Egypt come to mind In  the Egyptian stock exchange returned over  percent Whats going on in some of the other countries Lets look at some  numbers Kenya over  percent Nigeria over  percent South Africa in the  percents High ones These are the trends that are taking place But in any investment decision the key question is What is my alternative investment Because in Africa today we are competing globally for capital And global capital is agnostic  it has no loyalties Theres an overhang of capital in the US and the key is yield pickup What Africa is providing is a diversification play and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor thats aware of what he or she is doing Now when looking at Africa visavis other things and countries in Africa visavis other things comparisons become important  years ago there were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard amp Poors Moodys and Fitchs Today  African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings What does this mean Take Nigeria again double Bminus  in the league of Ukraine and Turkey Immediately we have a comparison The backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital Some other figures South Africa triple Bplus Botswana Aplus Bakino Faso Bminus And so on In fact one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa Why are they doing that Because they expect investment to follow So one of the big bellwethers and one of my final points I want to mention is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel Why is CNBC doing this Its the hour rolling African news channel Theyre doing it because they are expecting things to happen Me and you the investments we are going to be making the investments the world is going to be making  thats the hour news channel dedicated to Africa So thats the change thats coming down the pipeline So in conclusion I want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago This time Ill give you the entire picture that I saw in  and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent Because there are amazing opportunities available And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly In  Joseph Conrad released The Heart of Darkness a tale of grim horror along the Congo River If one looks carefully on the Congo River is one of those bright lights And thats the very Congo river generating light  the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydroelectric power That is a transformation in power of ideas So the next step over the next four days is us exploring more of these ideas And perchance if you can always keep this picture in your mind that when we convene maybe in the distant future in  that picture will look very different Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

155,I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago and a Nigerian journalist comes  and this will only make sense if youve ever watched a James Bond movie  and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes Aha we meet again Mr Bond It was great So Ive got a little sheet of paper here mostly because Im Nigerian and if you leave me alone Ill talk for like two hours I just want to say good afternoon good evening Its been an incredible few days Its downhill from now on I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris But also most importantly all the invisible people behind TED that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation Its really amazing Ive been in the audience Im a writer and Ive been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers and Ive been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah Like what have I got to say about all this And I was watching Jane Goodall yesterday and I thought it was really great and I was watching those incredible slides of the chimpanzees and I thought Wow What if a chimpanzee could talk you know What would it say My first thought was Well you know theres George Bush But then I thought Why be rude to chimpanzees I guess there goes my green card Theres been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa And whats become increasingly clear to me is that were talking about news stories about Africa were not really talking about African narratives And its important to make a distinction because if the news is anything to go by  percent of Americans cant  either cant afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance and have a president who despite the protest of millions of his citizens  even his own Congress  continues to prosecute a senseless war So if news is anything to go by the US is right there with Zimbabwe right Which it isnt really is it And talking about war my girlfriend has this great tshirt that says Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity Its amazing isnt it The truth is everything we know about America everything Americans come to know about being American isnt from the news I live there We dont go home at the end of the day and think Well I really know who I am now because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange closed at this many points What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories It comes from the novels the movies the fashion magazines It comes from popular culture In other words its the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are And this is important to remember because in Africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the San people through the Sundiata epics of Mali to modern contemporary literature If you want to know about Africa read our literature  and not just Things Fall Apart because that would be like saying Ive read Gone with the Wind and so I know everything about America Thats very important Theres a poem by Jack Gilbert called The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart He says When the Sumerian tablets were first translated they were thought to be business records But what if they were poems and psalms My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body Giraffes are this desire in the dark This is important Its important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity The first Igbo Bible was translated from English in about the s by Bishop Crowther who was a Yoruba And its important to know Igbo is a tonal language and so theyll say the word igwe and igwe same spelling one means sky or heaven and one means bicycle or iron So God is in heaven surrounded by His angels was translated as  Igbo And for some reason in Cameroon when they tried to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois they chose the Igbo version And Im not going to give you the patois translation Im going to make it standard English Basically it ends up as God is on a bicycle with his angels This is good because language complicates things You know we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live and I find thats not true The language actually makes the world in which we live Language is not  I mean things dont have any mutable value by themselves we ascribe them a value And language cant be understood in its abstraction It can only be understood in the context of story and everything all of this is story And its important to remember that because if we dont then we become ahistorical Weve had a lot of  a parade of amazing ideas here But these are not new to Africa Nigeria got its independence in  The first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in  following the Aba womens market riots In  in the middle of the BiafranNigerian Civil War Dr NjokuObi invented the Cholera vaccine So you know the thing is to remember that because otherwise  years from now well be back here trying to tell this story again So what it says to me then is that its not really  the problem isnt really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told the problem really is the terms of humanity that were willing to bring to complicate every story and thats really what its all about Let me tell you a Nigerian joke Well its just a joke anyway So theres Tom Dick and Harry and theyre working construction And Tom opens up his lunch box and theres rice in it and he goes on this rant about Twenty years my wife has been packing rice for lunch If she does it again tomorrow Im going to throw myself off this building and kill myself And Dick and Harry repeat this The next day Tom opens his lunchbox theres rice so he throws himself off and kills himself and Tom Dick and Harry follow And now the inquest  you know Toms wife and Dicks wife are distraught They wished theyd not packed rice But Harrys wife is confused because she said You know Harry had been packing his own lunch for  years This seemingly innocent joke when I heard it as a child in Nigeria was told about Igbo Yoruba and Hausa with the Hausa being Harry So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred My father was educated in Cork in the University of Cork in the s In fact every time I read in Ireland people get me all mistaken and they say Oh this is Chris OBarney from Cork But he was also in Oxford in the s and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria my father used to say to me You must never eat or drink in a Yoruba persons house because they will poison you It makes sense now when I think about it because if youd known my father you wouldve wanted to poison him too So I was born in  at the beginning of the BiafranNigerian Civil War and the war ended after three years And I was growing up in school and the federal government didnt want us taught about the history of the war because they thought it probably would make us generate a new generation of rebels So I had a very inventive teacher a Pakistani Muslim who wanted to teach us about this So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz I learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people I mean picture this  really picture this A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history to young Igbo children Story is powerful Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody And it should come as no surprise that my first novel at  was about NeoNazis taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich It makes perfect sense And they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country and they were foiled by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams and a Jewish Nazi hunter And it happened over four continents And when the book came out I was heralded as Africas answer to Frederick Forsyth which is a dubious honor at best But also the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt So at  I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria I grew up very privileged and its important to talk about privilege because we dont talk about it here A lot of us are very privileged I grew up  servants cars televisions all that stuff My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison and I had no language for it I was completely terrified completely broken and kept trying to find a new language a new way to make sense of all of this Six months after that with no explanation they let me go Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me But I mean I grew up with this incredible privilege and not just me  millions of Nigerians grew up with books and libraries In fact we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had All of those are gone We are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination In the film Sometimes in April by Raoul Peck Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised and hes being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend  fellow Rwandan Army officer albeit a Tutsi  played by Fraser James And Frasers on his knees arms tied behind his back and hes crying Hes sniveling Its a pitiful sight And as we watch it we are ashamed And we want to say to Idris Chop him up Shut him up And as Idris moves Fraser screams Stop Please stop Idris pauses then he moves again and Fraser says Please Please stop And its not the look of horror and terror on Frasers face that stops Idris or us its the look in Frasers eyes Its one that says Dont do this And Im not saying this to save myself although this would be nice Im doing it to save you because if you do this you will be lost To be so afraid that youre standing in the face of a death you cant escape and that youre soiling yourself and crying but to say in that moment as Fraser says to Idris Tell my girlfriend I love her In that moment Fraser says I am lost already but not you  not you This is a redemption we can all aspire to African narratives in the West they proliferate I really dont care anymore Im more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves  how as a writer I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent The question is how do I balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and selfloathing And this is the difficulty that I face I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning I am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible As a young middleclass Nigerian activist I launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government And I asked millions of people without questioning my right to do so to go up against the government And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed I justified it and I said This is the cost of revolution Have I not myself been imprisoned Have I not myself been beaten It wasnt until later when I was imprisoned again that I understood the real meaning of torture and how easy your humanity can be taken from you for the time I was engaged in war righteous righteous war Excuse me Sometimes I can stand before the world  and when I say this transformation is a difficult and slow process  sometimes I can stand before the world and say My name is Chris Abani I have been human six days but only sometimes But this is a good thing Its never going to be easy There are no answers As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth that I had challenged my students in America  I said You dont know anything about Africa youre all idiots And so they said Tell me about Africa Professor Abani So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa And the truth be told this is it isnt it There are no essential Africans and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from and yet we want to make profound statements about it And I think if we can just admit that were all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this that we can rise above all of this When I was  I read James Baldwins Another Country and that book broke me Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time but because the way James wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it Here Jimmy said Here is love all of it The fact that it happens in Another Country takes you quite by surprise My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world those who can count and those who cant He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential pure identity religious ethnic historical ideological I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation Its called Ode to the Drum and Ill try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read Gazelle I killed you for your skins exquisite touch for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet You know it wasnt anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell Weeks ago you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath her weight before you slouched into that grassy hush And now Im tightening lashes shaped in hide as if around a ribcage shaped like five bowstrings Ghosts cannot slip back inside the bodys drum Youve been seasoned by wind dusk and sunlight Pressure can make everything whole again Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood your face has been carved five times I have to drive trouble in the hills Trouble in the valley and trouble by the river too There is no palm wine fish salt or calabash Kadoom Kadoom Kadoom Kadoooom Now I have beaten a song back into you Rise and walk away like a panther Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

156,Like many of you here I am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in Africa The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent I want to tell you some stories that explain my view We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach Twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital The emergency generators did not start There was not a flashlight not a lantern not a candle  pitch black The patients cut open twice The first time it was a Csection Thankfully baby was out  mother and child survived The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia Anesthetic wears off The patient feels pain Hes crying Hes screaming Hes praying Pitch black Not a candle not a flashlight And that hospital could have afforded flashlights They could have afforded to purchase these things but they didnt And it happened twice Another time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had And so three months later just before she returned to the United States nurses in Accra go on strike And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone start all over again Start all over again Now what does this have to do with leadership You see the folks at the ministry of health the hospital administrators the doctors the nurses  they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school They are the elite They are our leaders Their decisions their actions matter And when they fail a nation literally suffers So when I speak of leadership Im not talking about just political leaders Weve heard a lot about that Im talking about the elite Those whove been trained whose job it is to be the guardians of their society The lawyers the judges the policemen the doctors the engineers the civil servants  those are the leaders And we need to train them right Now my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was  years old We had just had a military coup and soldiers were pervasive in our society They were a pervasive presence And one day I go to the airport to meet my father and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building Im stopped by two soldiers wielding AK assault weapons And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment Why Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds No sign to this effect Now I was  I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill I was especially concerned of what the girls might think And so I started to argue with these men It was a little reckless but you know I was  I got lucky A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament Because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him that theyre just following orders So he takes their radio talks to their boss and gets us all released What lessons would you take from an experience like this Several for me Leadership matters Those men are following the orders of a superior officer I learned something about courage It was important not to look at those guns And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls So a few years after this event I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education It was a breath of fresh air You know the faculty there didnt want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana They wanted us to think critically They wanted us to be analytical They wanted us to be concerned about social issues In my economics classes I got high marks for my understanding of basic economics But I learned something more profound than that which is that the leaders  the managers of Ghanas economy  were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse And so here was this lesson again  leadership matters It matters a great deal But I didnt really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore I had an inkling but I didnt fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation And I was part of this team  this thinking learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world And it was brilliant to be part of this team It was brilliant And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore this transformation  the ability to confront problems complex problems and to design solutions to those problems The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual And I was part of that Now while I was at Microsoft the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana And by the way its continued to The gap has widened since I left Now Ive already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred I mean its the people there who are so hardworking persistent creative empowered But there were also some external factors free markets the rule of law infrastructure These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously Somebody trained them to do the work that they do Now while I was at Microsoft this funny thing happened I became a parent And for the first time Africa mattered more to me than ever before Because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children That the state of the world  the state of the world depends on whats happening to Africa as far as my kids would be concerned And at this time when I was going through what I call my premidlife crisis Africa was a mess Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction and I needed to be back helping I couldnt just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in an uppermiddle class neighborhood and feel good about it This was not the world that Id want my children to grow up in So I decided to get engaged and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were And three things kept coming up for every problem corruption weak institutions and the people who run them  the leaders Now I was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with And they might say Look dont even try But for me I asked the question Well where are these leaders coming from What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system And it was the same  learning by rote  from primary school through graduate school Very little emphasis on ethics and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility This is wrong So I decided to engage this particular problem Because it seems to me that every society every society must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders And Ghana was not paying enough attention And this is true across subSaharan Africa actually So this is what Im doing now Im trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country I think it would make a huge difference And what Ashesi University is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical entrepreneurial leaders Were trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems ask the right questions and come up with workable solutions Ill admit that there are times when it seems like Mission Impossible but we must believe that these kids are smart That if we involve them in their education if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront  that our whole society confronts  and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will happen Now a month into this project wed just started classes And a month into it I come to the office and I have this email from one of our students And it said very simply I am thinking now And he signs off Thank you Its such a simple statement But I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young man And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way I am thinking now This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves Theres a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart Can we create a perfect society Her understanding that a studentcrafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible Now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it then we can achieve excellence I dont know ultimately what they will do I dont know whether they will decide to have this honor code But the conversation theyre having now  about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing Am I out of time OK Now I just wanted to leave that slide up because its important that we think about it Im very excited about the fact that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate That for many of them it has been a lifealtering experience These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership the real privilege of leadership which is after all to serve humanity I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government Its the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university It says a lot about her It says a lot about the culture thats forming on campus It says a lot about her peers who elected her She won with  percent of the vote And it gives me a lot of hope It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates whats happening with our students Weve graduated two classes of students to date And every single one of them has been placed And were getting great reports back from corporate Ghana corporate West Africa and the things that theyre most impressed about is work ethic You know that passion for what theyre doing The persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems that they havent seen before This is good because over the past five years there have been times when Ive felt this is Mission Impossible And its just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right I think that the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent Its an incredible opportunity There arent very many more opportunities like this in the world I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation It will depend on inspired leadership And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference Thank you and God bless ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

157,I really am honored to be here and as Chris said its been over  years since I started working in Africa My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty Ivory Coast morning I had just left Wall Street cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead given away most everything that I owned and arrived with all the essentials  some poetry a few clothes and of course a guitar  because I was going to save the world and I thought I would just start with the African continent But literally within days of arriving I was told in no uncertain terms by a number of West African women that Africans didnt want saving thank you very much least of all not by me I was too young unmarried I had no children didnt really know Africa and besides my French was pitiful And so it was an incredibly painful time in my life and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda and I met a group of Rwandan women who asked me in  to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there And I did and we ended up naming it Duterimbere meaning to go forward with enthusiasm And while we were doing it I realized that there werent a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women and so maybe I should try to run a business too And so I started looking around and I heard about a bakery that was run by  prostitutes And being a little intrigued I went to go meet this group and what I found was  unwed mothers who were trying to survive And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language and how what we call people so often distances us from them and makes them little I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business that in fact it was a classic charity run by a wellintentioned person who essentially spent  dollars a month to keep these  women busy making little crafts and baked goods and living on  cents a day still in poverty So I made a deal with the women I said Look we get rid of the charity side and we run this as a business and Ill help you They nervously agreed I nervously started and of course things are always harder than you think theyre going to be First of all I thought well we need a sales team and we clearly arent the ATeam here so lets  I did all this training And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo which is the popular quarter of Kigali with a bucket and I sold all these little doughnuts to people and I came back and I was like You see And the women said You know Jacqueline who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman And like  Laughter  its a good point So then I went the whole American way with competitions team and individual Completely failed but over time the women learnt to sell on their own way And they started listening to the marketplace and they came back with ideas for cassava chips and banana chips and sorghum bread and before you knew it we had cornered the Kigali market and the women were earning three to four times the national average And with that confidence surge I thought Well its time to create a real bakery so lets paint it And the women said Thats a really great idea And I said Well what color do you want to paint it And they said Well you choose And I said No no Im learning to listen You choose Its your bakery your street your country  not mine But they wouldnt give me an answer So one week two weeks three weeks went by and finally I said Well how about blue And they said Blue blue we love blue Lets do it blue So I went to the store I brought Gaudence the recalcitrant one of all and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains and on painting day we all gathered in Nyamirambo and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim like a little French bakery But that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky So blue blue everything became blue The walls were blue the windows were blue the sidewalk out front was painted blue And Aretha Franklin was shouting RESPECT the womens hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes but it was their day And at the end of it we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done and I said It is so beautiful And the women said It really is And I said And I think the color is perfect and they all nodded their head except for Gaudence and I said What And she said Nothing And I said What And she said Well it is pretty but you know our color really it is green And   I learned then that listening isnt just about patience but that when youve lived on charity and dependent your whole life long its really hard to say what you mean And mostly because people never really ask you and when they do you dont really think they want to know the truth And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting but its also learning how better to ask questions And so I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years doing these two things and it was an extraordinary time in my life And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today and certainly in the work that I do The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth As Eleni has said when people gain income they gain choice and that is fundamental to dignity But as human beings we also want to see each other and we want to be heard by each other and we should never forget that The second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty I think Andrew pretty well covered that so I will move to the third point which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty Yes we ran this as a business but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training and the management support the strategic advice and maybe most important of all the access to new contacts networks and new markets And so on a micro level theres a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy And on a macro level  some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized But having had a father with heart disease and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten and having a good friend step in to help I really believe that all people deserve access to health at prices they can afford I think the market can help us figure that out but theres got to be a charitable component or I dont think were going to create the kind of societies we want to live in And so it was really those lessons that made me decide to build Acumen Fund about six years ago Its a nonprofit venture capital fund for the poor a few oxymorons in one sentence It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals foundations and corporations and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both forprofit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health housing energy clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa so that they can make their own choices Weve invested about  million dollars in  different enterprises and have in so doing created nearly  jobs and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them I want to tell you two stories Both of them are in Africa Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service and who really know the markets Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise and both of them because theyre manufacturers create jobs directly and create incomes indirectly because theyre in the malaria sector and Africa loses about  billion dollars a year because of malaria And so as people get healthier they also get wealthier The first one is called Advanced BioExtracts Limited Its a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues These are oldhand farmers whove gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last  years Now this plant is an Artemisia plant its the basic component for artemisinin which is the bestknown treatment for malaria Its indigenous to China and the Far East but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa Patrick and his colleagues said Lets bring it here because its a high valueadd product The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize And so using patient capital  money that they could raise early on that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined with management assistance strategic assistance  theyve now created a company where they purchase from  farmers So thats about  people affected And I think some of you may have visited  these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe who help them become more selfsufficient They buy it they dry it and they bring it to this factory which was purchased in part by again patient capital from Novartis who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Coartem Acumens been working with ABE for the past year year and a half both on looking at a new business plan and what does expansion look like helping with management support and helping to do term sheets and raise capital And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so Because the company was literally  days away from proving that the product they produced was at the worldquality level needed to make Coartem when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history And we called all of the social investors we know Now some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture and they even helped the farmers And even when we explained that if ABE goes away all those  jobs go away too we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social And its really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused So Acumen made not one but two bridge loans and the good news is they did indeed meet worldquality classification and are now in the final stages of closing a milliondollar round to move it to the next level and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa This is Samuel Hes a farmer He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the valueadd potential So he moved back to the farm and long story short they now have seven acres under cultivation Samuels kids are in private school and hes starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production  dignity being more important than wealth The next one many of you know I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing which is one of the great real companies in East Africa Its another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise And this is really a story about a publicprivate solution that has really worked It started in Japan Sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylenebased fiber with organic insecticide so you could create a bed net a malaria bed net that would last five years and not need to be redipped It could alter the vector but like Artemisia it had been produced only in East Asia And as part of its social responsibility Sumitomo said Why dont we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa for Africans UNICEF came forward and said Well buy most of the nets and then well give them away as part of the global funds and the UNs commitment to pregnant women and children for free Acumen came in with the patient capital and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa and Exxon provided the initial resin Well in looking around for entrepreneurs there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah in A to Z manufacturing company Its a yearold company it understands manufacturing Its gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania and continued to flourish It had about  employees when we first found it And so Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria And long story short again theyve been so successful In our first year the first net went off the line in October of  We thought the hittingitoutofthebox number was  nets a year This year they are now producing eight million nets a year and they employ  people  percent of whom are women mostly unskilled Theyre in a joint venture with Sumitomo And so from an enterprise perspective for Africa and from a public health perspective these are real successes But its only half the story if were really looking at solving problems of poverty because its not longterm sustainable Its a company with one big customer And if avian flu hits or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority everybody loses And so Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that look in a country like Tanzania  percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day It costs at manufacturing point six dollars to produce these and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it so the market price in a free market would be about  dollars per net Most people cant afford that so lets give it away free And we said Well theres another option Lets use the market as the best listening device we have and understand at what price people would pay for this so they get the dignity of choice We can start building local distribution and actually it can cost the public sector much less And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z a loan as well as a grant so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace and found a number of things One that people will pay different prices but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it And when you listen to them theyll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they dont like And that some of the channels we thought would work didnt work But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital weve now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute and a dollar to buy the net So then from a policy perspective when you start with the market we have a choice We can continue going along at  dollars a net and the customer pays zero or we could at least experiment with some of it to charge one dollar a net costing the public sector another six dollars a net give the people the dignity of choice and have a distribution system that might over time start sustaining itself Weve got to start having conversations like this and I dont think theres any better way to start than using the market but also to bring other people to the table around it Whenever I go to visit A to Z I think of my grandmother Stella She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines She grew up on a farm in Austria very poor didnt have very much education She moved to the United States where she met my grandfather who was a cement hauler and they had nine children Three of them died as babies My grandmother had tuberculosis and she worked in a sewing machine shop making shirts for about  cents an hour She like so many of the women I see at A to Z worked hard every day understood what suffering was had a deep faith in God loved her children and would never have accepted a handout But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams I look around at my siblings and my cousins  and as I said there are a lot of us  and I see teachers and musicians hedge fund managers designers One sister who makes other peoples wishes come true And my wish when I see those women I meet those farmers and I think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility and that they also can believe and get access to services so that their children too can live those lives of great purpose It shouldnt be that difficult But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions get out of our ideological boxes It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success It takes opening your arms both wide and expecting very little love in return but demanding accountability and bringing the accountability to the table as well And most of all most of all it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience whether we are rich or poor African or nonAfrican local or diaspora left or right to really start listening to each other Thank you ,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

158,Id like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa  those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid And of course Im dedicating it also to my grandmother whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles especially for me when I was an activist and being harassed by the police You will recall that in  June  the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans  biology mathematics  and what about our languages And the students wanted to speak to the government and police answered with bullets So every year June  we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died And I was very young then I think I was  years and I started asking questions and thats when my political education started And I joined later on the youth organization under the African National Congress So as part of organizing this and whatever this commemoration the police will round us up as they call us leaders And I used to run away from home when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or th of June or so And my grandmother one time said No look youre not going to run away This is your place you stay here And indeed the police came  because theyll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like after the th or so So it was on the th of June and they came and they surrounded the house and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house and opened the kitchen door And she said to them Vusis here and youre not going to take him tonight Im tired of you having to come here harassing us while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes He is here and youre not going to take him Ive got a bowl full of boiling water  the first one who comes in here gets it And they left Applause Music  Thula Mama Thula Mama Thula Mama Thula Mama   Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory   I know the truth in your smile   I know the truth in your smile   piercing through the gloom of my ignorance   Oh there is a mama lying down sleeping   youre very ill and your heart crying   Wondering wondering wondering wondering where is this world coming to   Is it right the children have to fend for themselves No no no no no no   Is it right heaping trouble on an old ladys head   So unlucky faceless people   Thula Mama Mama Thula Mama Thula Mama Mama   Thula Mama Thula Mama Thula Mama Mama Thula Mama   Tomorrow its going to be better   Tomorrow its going to be better to climb Mama   Thula Mama Thula Mama   Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour   And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing   baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby   Should I now stop singing of love   now that my memorys surrounded by blood   Sister why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer   So who are they who says no more love poems now   I want to sing a song of love   for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant   and still gave birth to a healthy child   Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile   that will ignite my love song my song of life   my song of love my song of life my song of love   my song of life my song of love my song of life   Ooh Ive not tried to run away from song   I hear a persistent voice more powerful than the enemy bombs   The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood   My song of love and my song of life my song of love   my song of life my song of love   my song of life my song of love  I want everybody to sing with me    my song of life my song of love my song of life  everybody sing with me    my song of life my song of love  I cant hear you    my song of love my song of life  you can do better    my song of life my song of love  keep singing keep singing    my song of love my song of life yes my song of love    you can do better than that    my song of life yes my song of love my song of life my song of love    keep singing keep singing keep singing  my song of love   Oh yeah My song of  a love song my song of life Sing A love song my song of life Sing   Love song my song of life Sing Love song my song of life Sing   Love song my song of life Sing Love song my song of life   Love song my song of life  ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

159,I am very very happy to be amidst some of the most  the lights are really disturbing my eyes and theyre reflecting on my glasses I am very happy and honored to be amidst very very innovative and intelligent people I have listened to the three previous speakers and guess what happened Every single thing I planned to say they have said it here and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something that bud is a young one So I will  since I am not young and am very old I still will say something We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment because another conference is taking place in Berlin It is the G Summit The G Summit proposes that the solution to Africas problems should be a massive increase in aid something akin to the Marshall Plan Unfortunately I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan One because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated Its largest recipients were Germany and France and it was only  percent of their GDP An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of   percent of its GDP and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect How the media covers Africa in the West and the consequences of that By displaying despair helplessness and hopelessness the media is telling the truth about Africa and nothing but the truth However the media is not telling us the whole truth Because despair civil war hunger and famine although theyre part and parcel of our African reality they are not the only reality And secondly they are the smallest reality Africa has  nations We have civil wars only in six countries which means that the media are covering only six countries Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience But the effect of that presentation is it appeals to sympathy It appeals to pity It appeals to something called charity And as a consequence the Western view of Africas economic dilemma is framed wrongly The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair What should we do with it We should give food to the hungry We should deliver medicines to those who are ill We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war And in the process Africa has been stripped of selfinitiative I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses But equally it has opportunities and a lot of potential We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa from a challenge of despair which is called poverty reduction to a challenge of hope We frame it as a challenge of hope and that is worth creation The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty It should be a challenge of creating wealth Once we change those two things  if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent with what Medicines for the poor food relief for those who are hungry and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war And in the process none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms not the causes of Africas fundamental problems Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines ladies and gentlemen does not create wealth for them Wealth is a function of income and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a wellpaying job Now once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa our second challenge will be who are the wealthcreating agents in any society They are entrepreneurs Unclear told us they are always about four percent of the population but  percent are imitators But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship So where should we be putting the money We need to put money where it can productively grow Support private investment in Africa both domestic and foreign Support research institutions because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today They are throwing large sums of money for primary health for primary education for food relief The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair in need of charity Ladies and gentlemen can any one of you tell me a neighbor a friend a relative that you know who became rich by receiving charity By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms Does any one of you in the audience have that person Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another Well since Im not seeing the hand it appears that what Im stating is true Bono Yes Andrew Mwenda I can see Bono says he knows the country Which country is that Bono Its an Irish land Bono unclear AM Thank you very much But let me tell you this External actors can only present to you an opportunity The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity Africa has received many opportunities Many of them we havent benefited much Why Because we lack the internal institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations Ill give you an example Under the Cotonou Agreement formerly known as the Lome Convention African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods dutyfree to the European Union market My own country Uganda has a quota to export  metric tons of sugar to the European Union market We havent exported one kilogram yet We import  metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba Secondly under the beef protocol of that agreement African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef dutyfree to the European Union market None of those countries including Africas most successful nation Botswana has ever met its quota So I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africas inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework And all forms of intervention need support the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth the kinds of institutions that increase productivity How do we begin to do that and why is aid the bad instrument Aid is the bad instrument and do you know why Because all governments across the world need money to survive Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial they need really to have the army clobber the opposition The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangerson Why should people support their government Well because it gives them good paying jobs or in many African countries unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption The fact is no government in the world with the exception of a few like that of Idi Amin can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule Many countries in the unclear they need legitimacy To get legitimacy governments often need to deliver things like primary education primary health roads build hospitals and clinics If the governments fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people such a government is driven by selfinterest to govern in a more enlightened fashion It will sit with those who create wealth Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa The productive margin in our governments search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy it lies with international donors Rather than sit with Ugandan  Applause  rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs Ghanaian businessmen South African enterprising leaders our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank I can tell you even if you have ten PhDs you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry Why Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business  it requires that you listen to the people the private sector actors in that industry Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity by the international community to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank and then it is the IMF and the World Bank that tell them what its citizens need In the process we the African people have been sidelined from the policymaking policyorientation and policy implementation process in our countries We have limited input because he who pays the piper calls the tune The IMF the World Bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens and therefore what our governments are doing because they depend on aid is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens But I want to put a caveat on my argument and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive Some aid may have built a hospital fed a hungry village It may have built a road and that road may have served a very good role The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success generalize them pour billions and trillions of dollars into them and then spread them across the whole world ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village the skills the practices the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed  like in Sauri village in Kenya where Jeffrey Sachs is working  and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody Aid increases the resources available to governments and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in Africa seeking a career By increasing the political attractiveness of the state especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie Ladies and gentlemen the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business Governments are not changing it Why Because they dont need to talk to their own citizens They talk to international donors So the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid I also want to say that it is important for us to note that over the last  years Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community in the form of technical assistance and financial aid and all other forms of aid Between  and  our continent received  billion dollars of aid and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa Where has all the aid gone I want to use the example of my own country called Uganda and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there In the  budget expected revenue  trillion shillings The expected foreign aid  trillion Ugandas recurrent expenditure  by recurrent what do I mean Handtomouth is  trillion Why does the government of Uganda budget spend  percent of its own revenue Its because theres somebody there called foreign aid who contributes for it But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure Public administration which is largely patronage takes  billion The military  billion Agriculture which employs  percent of our povertystricken citizens takes only  billion Trade and industry takes  billion And let me show you what does public expenditure  rather public administration expenditure  in Uganda constitute There you go  cabinet ministers  presidential advisers by the way who never see the president except on television And when they see him physically it is at public functions like this and even there it is him who advises them We have  units of local government Each local government is organized like the central government  a bureaucracy a cabinet a parliament and so many jobs for the political hangerson There were  and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits he had to create  new districts and now there are  Three hundred thirtythree members of parliament You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament One hundred thirtyfour commissions and semiautonomous government bodies all of which have directors and the cars And the final thing this is addressed to Mr Bono In his work he may help us on this A recent government of Uganda study found that there are  fourwheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters Uganda has  subcounties each of them with a dispensary none of which has an ambulance So the fourwheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers the permanent secretaries the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects while the poor die without ambulances and medicine Finally I want to say that before I came to speak here I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt It should be short enough to arouse interest but long enough to cover the subject I hope I have achieved that Thank you very much

161,Now have any of yall ever looked up this word You know in a dictionary Laughter Yeah thats what I thought How about this word Here Ill show it to you Lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries Notice  were very specific  that word compile The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock Its made up of lots of little bits Its little discrete  thats spelled DISCRETE  bits And those bits are words Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer  besides getting to come to TED  is that you get to say really fun words like lexicographical Lexicographical has this great pattern its called a double dactyl And just by saying double dactyl Ive sent the geek needle all the way into the red Laughter Applause But lexicographical is the same pattern as higgledypiggledy Right Its a fun word to say and I get to say it a lot Now one of the nonperks of being a lexicographer is that people dont usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly image of the dictionary Right Nobody hugs their dictionaries But what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this Just to let you know I do not have a lexicographical whistle But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult lefthand turn into the dictionary and keep the bad words out But the thing is I dont want to be a traffic cop For one thing I just do not do uniforms And for another deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy And its not very fun And when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work I would much rather be a fisherman I want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom But why do people want me to direct traffic when I would much rather go fishing Well I blame the Queen Why do I blame the Queen Well first of all I blame the Queen because its funny But secondly I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the Fword which has happened in American dictionaries since  So theres this guy right Victorian era James Murray first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary I do not have that hat I wish I had that hat So hes really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today When a guy who looks like that in that hat is the face of modernity you have a problem And so James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today Thered be virtually no learning curve And of course a few of us are saying okay computers Computers What about computers The thing about computers is I love computers I mean Im a huge geek I love computers I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me But computers dont do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries They dont change the end result Because what a dictionary is is its Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion Its steampunk What we have is an electric velocipede You know we have Victorian design with an engine on it Thats all The design has not changed And OK what about online dictionaries right Online dictionaries must be different This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online one of the best online dictionaries This is my favorite word by the way Erinaceous pertaining to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog Very useful word So look at that Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen This is flat Look how many links there are in the actual entry two Right Those little buttons I had them all expanded except for the date chart So theres not very much going on here Theres not a lot of clickiness And in fact online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print except for searchability And when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which is serendipity Serendipity is when you find things you werent looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult So  Laughter Applause  now when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem Does everyone know the ham butt problem Womans making a ham for a big family dinner She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece of ham and shes like This is a perfectly good piece of ham Why am I throwing this away She thought Well my mom always did this So she calls up mom and she says Mom whyd you cut the butt off the ham when youre making a ham She says I dont know my mom always did it So they call grandma and grandma says My pan was too small Laughter So its not that we have good words and bad words We have a pan thats too small You know that ham butt is delicious Theres no reason to throw it away The bad words  see when people think about a place and they dont find a place on the map they think This map sucks When they find a nightspot or a bar and its not in the guidebook theyre like Ooh this place must be cool Its not in the guidebook When they find a word thats not in the dictionary they think This must be a bad word Why Its more likely to be a bad dictionary Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan So you cant get a smaller ham The English language is as big as it is So if you have a ham butt problem and youre thinking about the ham butt problem the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive paper is the enemy of words How can this be I mean I love books I really love books Some of my best friends are books But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary Now theyre going to think Oh boy People are going to take away my beautiful paper dictionaries No There will still be paper dictionaries When we had cars  when cars became the dominant mode of transportation we didnt round up all the horses and shoot them You know therere still going to be paper dictionaries but its not going to be the dominant dictionary The bookshaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in And its not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in So think about it this way if youve got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview What if biologists could only study animals that made people go Aww Right What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study Wed know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna and not very much about much else And I think this is a problem I think we should study all the words because when you think about words you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts Lexicography is really more about material science We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression your speeches and your writing And then often people say to me Well OK how do I know that this word is real They think OK if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ballpeen hammer Theyre just the right tools for the job And so people say to me How do I know if a word is real You know anybody whos read a childrens book knows that love makes things real If you love a word use it That makes it real Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction It doesnt make a word any more real than any other way If you love a word it becomes real So if were not worrying about directing traffic if weve transcended paper if we are worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes is touched any time you touch a word you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it you make the mobile move You didnt break it Its just in a new position and that new position can be just as beautiful Now if youre no longer a traffic cop  the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection or the cars get confused Right But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic but maybe to count the cars that go by then more eyeballs are better You can ask for help If you ask for help you get more done And we really need help Library of Congress  million books of which half are in English If only one out of every  of those books had a word thats not in the dictionary in it that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries And I find an undictionaried word  a word like undictionaried for example  in almost every book I read What about newspapers Newspaper archive goes back to   million newspaper pages If only one in  of those pages had an undictionaried word on it it would be an entire other OED Thats  more words So thats a lot And Im not even talking about magazines Im not talking about blogs  and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time Theres a lot going on there And Im not even talking about polysemy which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves So if you think of the word set a set can be a badgers burrow a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff and theres one numbered definition in the OED The OED has  different numbered definitions for set Tiny little word  numbered definitions One of them is just labeled miscellaneous technical senses Do you know what that says to me That says to me it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub Laughter Thats a lexicographical cop out to say miscellaneous technical senses So we have all these words and we really need help And the thing is we could ask for help  asking for helps not that hard I mean lexicography is not rocket science See I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers and this is more of a visual explanation If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark If that was the map of all the words in American English we dont know very much And we dont even know the shape of the language If this was the dictionary  if this was the map of American English  look we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida but theres no California Were missing California from American English We just dont know enough and we dont even know that were missing California We dont even see that theres a gap on the map So again lexicography is not rocket science But even if it were rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days You know It cant be that hard to find some words So enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help and theyre doing a good job of it For instance theres eBird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings And then ornithologists can go and help track populations migrations etc And theres this guy Mike Oates Mike Oates lives in the UK Hes a director of an electroplating company Hes found more than  comets Hes found so many comets they named a comet after him Its kind of out past Mars Its a hike I dont think hes getting his picture taken there anytime soon But he found  comets without a telescope He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite and thats how he found them If we can find comets without a telescope shouldnt we be able to find words Now yall know where Im going with this Because Im going to the Internet which is where everybody goes And the Internet is great for collecting words because the Internets full of collectors And this is a littleknown technological fact about the Internet but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography Isnt that great So there are a lot of really good wordcollecting sites out there right now but the problem with some of them is that theyre not scientific enough They show the word but they dont show any context Where did it come from Who said it What newspaper was it in What book Because a word is like an archaeological artifact If you dont know the provenance or the source of the artifact its not science its a pretty thing to look at So a word without its source is like a cut flower You know its pretty to look at for a while but then it dies It dies too fast So this whole time Ive been saying The dictionary the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary Not a dictionary or dictionaries And thats because well people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language They use it synecdochically And one of the problems of knowing a word like synecdochically is that you really want an excuse to say synecdochically This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say synecdochically to all of you So Im really sorry But when you use a part of something  like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the United States its a symbol of the country  then youre using it synecdochically But the thing is we could make the dictionary the whole language If we get a bigger pan then we can put all the words in We can put in all the meanings Doesnt everyone want more meaning in their lives And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language  we can make it be the whole language You see what Im really hoping for is that my son who turns seven this month  I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in This is what dictionaries used to look like I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eighttrack tape Its a format that died because it wasnt useful enough It wasnt really what people needed And the thing is if we can put in all the words no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad we can really describe the language like scientists We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers If we can do that then I can spend all my time fishing and I dont have to be a traffic cop anymore Thank you very much for your kind attention ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

162,"I would like to tell you about a project
which I started about  years ago Its about making new forms of life And these are made of this kind of tube  electricity tube we call it in Holland And we can start a film about that and we can see a little bit
backwards in time Video Narrator Eventually these beasts
are going to live in herds on the beaches Theo Jansen is working hard
on this evolution Theo Jansen I want to put
these forms of life on the beaches And they should survive over there on their own in the future Learning to live on their own  and itll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own Narrator The mechanical beasts
will not get their energy from food but from the wind The wind will move feathers on their back
which will drive their feet The beast walks sideways
on the wet sand of the beach with its nose pointed into the wind As soon as it walks into
either the rolling surf or the dry sand it stops and walks
in the opposite direction Evolution has generated many species Music This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa Music TJ This is a herd and it is built
according to genetic codes And it is a sort of race
and each and every animal is different and the winning codes will multiply This is the wave
going from left to right You can see this one Yes and now it goes from left to right This is a new generation a new family which is able to store the wind So the wings pump up air
in lemonade bottles which are on top of that And they can use that energy
in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy
to reach the dunes and save their lives because they are drowned very easily I could show you this animal Thank you So the proportion of the tubes in this
animal is very important for the walking There are  numbers
which I call The  Holy Numbers These are the distances of the tubes
which make it walk that way In fact its a new
invention of the wheel It works the same as a wheel The axis of a wheel
stays on the same level and this hip is staying
on the same level as well In fact this is better than a wheel because when you try to drive
your bicycle on the beach you will notice its very hard to do And the feet just step over the sand and the wheel has to touch every piece
of the ground inbetween So  years after
the invention of the wheel we have a new wheel I will show you in the next video  can you start it please  that very heavy loads can be moved Theres a guy pushing there behind but it can also walk
on the wind very well Its  tons This is working on the stored
wind in the bottles It has a feeler where it can
feel obstacles and turn around You see its going the other way Can I have the feeler here OK Good So they have to survive
all the dangers of the beach and one of the big dangers is the sea This is the sea And it must feel the water of the sea And this is the water feeler and whats very important is this tube It sucks in air normally but when it swallows water
it feels the resistance of it So imagine that the animal
is walking towards the sea As soon as it touches the water  you should hear a sound of running air Sound of running air Yes So if it doesnt feel
it will be drowned OK Here we have the brain of the animal In fact it is a step counter
and it counts the steps Its a binary step counter So as soon it has been to the sea it changes the pattern
of zeroes and ones here And it always knows
where it is on the beach So its very simple brain It says well theres the sea
there are dunes and Im here So its a sort of imagination
of the simple world of the beach animal Thank you One of the biggest enemies are the storms This is a part of the nose
of the Animaris Percipiere When the nose of the animal
is fixed the whole animal is fixed So when the storm is coming up it drives a pin into the ground Audience member Wow The nose is fixed
the whole animal is fixed The wind may turn but the animal
will always turn its nose into the wind Now another couple of years and these
animals will survive on their own I still have to help them a lot Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

163,Images like this from the Auschwitz concentration camp have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are where weve come from and the times we live in During the twentieth century we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin Hitler Mao Pol Pot Rwanda and other genocides and even though the twentyfirst century is only seven years old we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq This has led to a common understanding of our situation namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from to our peril Here is an example from an oped on Thanksgiving in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago where the writer wrote The Indian life was a difficult one but there were no employment problems community harmony was strong substance abuse unknown crime nearly nonexistent what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter Now youre all familiar with this treacle We teach it to our children We hear it on television and in storybooks Now the original title of this session was Everything You Know Is Wrong and Im going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong that in fact our ancestors were far more violent than we are that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species existence Now in the decade of Darfur and Iraq a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene But Im going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon You can see it over millennia over centuries over decades and over years although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century One sees it all over the world although not homogeneously Its especially evident in the West beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment Let me take you on a journey of several powers of   from the millennium scale to the year scale  to try to persuade you of this Until  years ago all humans lived as huntergatherers without permanent settlements or government And this is the state thats commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley looking at casualty rates among contemporary huntergatherers which is our best source of evidence about this way of life has shown a rather different conclusion Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging or hunting and gathering societies The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man as opposed to passing away of natural causes in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest And they range from a rate of almost a  percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to in the case of the Gebusi only a  percent chance The tiny little blue bar in the lower lefthand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century and includes all the deaths of both World Wars If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the th century there would have been two billion deaths rather than  million Also at the millennium scale we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible And in this supposed source of our moral values one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare such as the following from Numbers  And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses and they slew all the males And Moses said unto them Have you saved all the women alive Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves In other words kill the men kill the children if you see any virgins then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk Also in the Bible one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality adultery blasphemy idolatry talking back to your parents  Laughter  and picking up sticks on the Sabbath Well lets click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude and look at the century scale Although we dont have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times we know just from conventional history  the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence For example any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine in those days would result in your tongue being cut out your ears being cut off you being blinded a hand being chopped off and so on There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment burning at the stake disemboweling breaking on the wheel being pulled apart by horses and so on The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of nonviolent crimes criticizing the king stealing a loaf of bread Slavery of course was the preferred laborsaving device and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat howling in pain was burned to death What about oneonone murder Well there there are good statistics because many municipalities recorded the cause of death The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village hamlet town county that he could find and he supplemented them with national data when nations started keeping statistics He plotted on a logarithmic scale going from  deaths per  people per year which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per  people per year in seven or eight European countries Then there is a slight uptick in the s The people who said that rock n roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century Lets click down now to the decade scale According to nongovernmental organizations that keep such statistics since  in Europe and the Americas there has been a steep decline in interstate wars in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms and in military coups even in South America Worldwide theres been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars The yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from  to the present And as you can see the death rate goes down from  deaths per conflict per year in the s to less than  deaths per conflict per year in this decade as horrific as it is Even in the year scale one can see a decline of violence Since the end of the Cold War there have been fewer civil wars fewer genocides  indeed a  percent reduction since postWorld War II highs  and even a reversal of the s uptick in homicide and violent crime This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the s and the s then it soared upward for several decades and began a precipitous decline starting in the s so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in  President Clinton if youre here thank you So the question is why are so many people so wrong about something so important I think there are a number of reasons One of them is we have better reporting The Associated Press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenthcentury monks were Theres a cognitive illusion We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something the higher the probability that you assign to it Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets no one ever attracted observers advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better Theres guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture And of course our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior One of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time Thats a process that seems to be continuing but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards So today we get exercised  and rightly so  if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas after a year appeal process We dont consider that a couple of hundred years ago they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted  minutes and indeed that that would have been repeated over and over again Today we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink rather than how high our standards have risen Well why has violence declined No one really knows but I have read four explanations all of which I think have some grain of plausibility The first is maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary poor nasty brutish and short Not because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative but because of the logic of anarchy In a state of anarchy theres a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively before they invade you More recently Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement Being a good American he has a pistol in the nightstand pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand Now each one of them is thinking I dont really want to kill that guy but hes about to kill me Maybe I had better shoot him before he shoots me especially since even if he doesnt want to kill me hes probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me And so on Huntergatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first Now one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence You dont strike first but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded The only thing is that its liable to having its bluff called and therefore can only work if its credible To make it credible you must avenge all insults and settle all scores which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta Life becomes an episode of The Sopranos Hobbes solution the Leviathan was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency  a leviathan  then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack because any kind of aggression will be punished leaving its profitability as zero That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively out of fear of them attacking you first It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible And therefore it would lead to a state of peace Eisner  the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide  argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states So thats a bit of a support for the leviathan theory Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy in failed states collapsed empires frontier regions mafias street gangs and so on The second explanation is that in many times and places there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap In earlier times when suffering and early death were common in ones own life one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant one puts a higher value on life in general This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzerosum game and was worked out in the book Nonzero by the journalist Robert Wright Wright points out that in certain circumstances cooperation or nonviolence can benefit both parties in an interaction such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead or when two parties lay down their arms and split the socalled peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positivesum games that humans tend to be embroiled in by allowing the trade of goods services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead and violence declines for selfish reasons As Wright put it Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my minivan The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called The Expanding Circle by the philosopher Peter Singer who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy an ability to treat other peoples interests as comparable to ones own Unfortunately by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family People outside that circle are treated as subhuman and can be exploited with impunity But over history the circle has expanded One can see in historical record it expanding from the village to the clan to the tribe to the nation to other races to both sexes and in Singers own arguments something that we should extend to other sentient species The question is if this has happened what has powered that expansion And there are a number of possibilities such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for The logic of the golden rule  the more you think about and interact with other people the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs at least not if you want them to listen to you You cant say that my interests are special compared to yours anymore than you can say that the particular spot that Im standing on is a unique part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minute It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism by histories and journalism and memoirs and realistic fiction and travel and literacy which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as subhuman and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life the sense that there but for fortune go I Whatever its causes the decline of violence I think has profound implications It should force us to ask not just why is there war But also why is there peace Not just what are we doing wrong But also what have we been doing right Because we have been doing something right and it sure would be good to find out what it is Thank you very much Applause Chris Anderson I loved that talk I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of  that you were talking about that Peter Singer talks about is also driven by just by technology by greater visibility of the other and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller I mean is that also a grain of truth Steven Pinker Very much It would fit both in Wrights theory that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles But also I think it helps us imagine what its like to be someone else I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages you think how could they possibly have done it how could they have not have empathized with the person that theyre disemboweling But clearly as far as theyre concerned this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own Anything I think that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person CA Well Steve I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year I think its really important Thank you so much SP My pleasure ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

164,This is a picture of Maurice Druon the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of LAcademie francaise the French Academy He is splendidly attired in his dollar uniform befitting the role of the French Academy as legislating the correct usage in French and perpetuating the language The French Academy has two main tasks it compiles a dictionary of official French Theyre now working on their ninth edition which they began in  and theyve reached the letter P They also legislate on correct usage such as the proper term for what the French call email which ought to be courriel The World Wide Web the French are told ought to be referred to as la toile daraignee mondiale  the Global Spider Web  recommendations that the French gaily ignore Now this is one model of how language comes to be namely its legislated by an academy But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit that language rather emerges from human minds interacting from one another And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language  the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary it will already be well out of date We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon of the historical change in languages in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature so much as a window onto human nature In a book that Im currently working on I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction And Im going to say a few words about each one this morning Let me start off with a technical problem in language that Ive worried about for quite some time  and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how theyre used The problem is which verbs go in which constructions The verb is the chassis of the sentence Its the framework onto which the other parts are bolted Let me give you a quick reminder of something that youve long forgotten An intransitive verb such as dine for example cant take a direct object You have to say Sam dined not Sam dined the pizza A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there Sam devoured the pizza You cant just say Sam devoured There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type each of which shapes its sentence So a problem in explaining how children learn language a problem in teaching language to adults so that they dont make grammatical errors and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions For example the dative construction in English You can say Give a muffin to a mouse the prepositional dative Or Give a mouse a muffin the doubleobject dative Promise anything to her Promise her anything and so on Hundreds of verbs can go both ways So a tempting generalization for a child for an adult for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction subjectverbthingtoarecipient can also be expressed as subjectverbrecipientthing A handy thing to have because language is infinite and you cant just parrot back the sentences that youve heard Youve got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences This would be an example of how to do that Unfortunately there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions You can say Biff drove the car to Chicago but not Biff drove Chicago the car You can say Sal gave Jason a headache but its a bit odd to say Sal gave a headache to Jason The solution is that these constructions despite initial appearance are not synonymous that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition you see that theres a subtle difference in meaning between them So give the X to the Y that construction corresponds to the thought cause X to go to Y Whereas give the Y the X corresponds to the thought cause Y to have X Now many events can be subject to either construal kind of like the classic figureground reversal illusions in which you can either pay attention to the particular object in which case the space around it recedes from attention or you can see the faces in the empty space in which case the object recedes out of consciousness How are these construals reflected in language Well in both cases the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object the noun after the verb So when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere  where youre doing something to the muffin  you say Give the muffin to the mouse When you construe it as cause the mouse to have something youre doing something to the mouse and therefore you express it as Give the mouse the muffin So which verbs go in which construction  the problem with which I began  depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change To give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have To drive the car only causes something to go because Chicagos not the kind of thing that can possess something Only humans can possess things And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache but its not as if youre taking the headache out of your head and causing it to go to the other person and implanting it in them You may just be loud or obnoxious or some other way causing them to have the headache So thats an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job So why should anyone care Well there are a number of interesting conclusions I think from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs First theres a level of finegrained conceptual structure which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence that governs our use of language You can think of this as the language of thought or mentalese It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs  not only in English but in all other languages  fundamental concepts such as space time causation and human intention such as what is the means and what is the ends These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that Immanuel Kant argued are the basic framework for human thought and its interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these Kantian categories Doesnt care about perceptual qualities such as color texture weight and speed which virtually never differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally but in a quasimetaphorical way For example this construction the dative is used not only to transfer things but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas as when we say She told a story to me or told me a story Max taught Spanish to the students or taught the students Spanish Its exactly the same construction but no muffins no mice nothing moving at all It evokes the container metaphor of communication in which we conceive of ideas as objects sentences as containers and communication as a kind of sending As when we say we gather our ideas to put them into words and if our words arent empty or hollow we might get these ideas across to a listener who can unpack our words to extract their content And indeed this kind of verbiage is not the exception but the rule Its very hard to find any example of abstract language that is not based on some concrete metaphor For example you can use the verb go and the prepositions to and from in a literal spatial sense The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul You can also say Biff went from sick to well He neednt go anywhere He could have been in bed the whole time but its as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving Or The meeting went from three to four in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line Likewise we use force to indicate not only physical force as in Rose forced the door to open but also interpersonal force as in Rose forced Sadie to go not necessarily by manhandling her but by issuing a threat Or Rose forced herself to go as if there were two entities inside Roses head engaged in a tug of a war Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways such as cause something to go to someone and causing someone to have something I think is a fundamental feature of human thought and its the basis for much human argumentation in which people dont differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed Just to give you a few examples ending a pregnancy versus killing a fetus a ball of cells versus an unborn child invading Iraq versus liberating Iraq redistributing wealth versus confiscating earnings And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts  such as objects space time causation and intention  which are useful in a social knowledgeintensive species whose evolution you can well imagine and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content  space time and force  and apply them to new abstract domains therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals to conceptualize mathematics physics law and other abstract domains Well I said Id talk about two windows on human nature  the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world and now Im going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction again as reflected in language And Ill start out with a puzzle the puzzle of indirect speech acts Now Im sure most of you have seen the movie Fargo And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer is asked to show his drivers license and holds his wallet out with a dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet And he says I was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo which everyone including the audience interprets as a veiled bribe This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language For example in polite requests if someone says If you could pass the guacamole that would be awesome we know exactly what he means even though thats a rather bizarre concept being expressed Would you like to come up and see my etchings I think most people understand the intent behind that And likewise if someone says Nice store youve got there It would be a real shame if something happened to it  Laughter  we understand that as a veiled threat rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities So the puzzle is why are bribes polite requests solicitations and threats so often veiled No ones fooled Both parties know exactly what the speaker means and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows etc etc So whats going on I think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships and human relationships fall into a number of types Theres an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske in which relationships can be categorized more or less into communality which works on the principle whats mine is thine whats thine is mine the kind of mindset that operates within a family for example dominance whose principle is dont mess with me reciprocity you scratch my back Ill scratch yours and sexuality in the immortal words of Cole Porter Lets do it Now relationship types can be negotiated Even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied they can be stretched and extended For example communality applies most naturally within family or friends but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it For example in brotherhoods fraternal organizations sororities locutions like the family of man you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin Now mismatches  when one person assumes one relationship type and another assumes a different one  can be awkward If you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss plate for example that would be an awkward situation Or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal that would be rather awkward as well In less blatant cases theres still a kind of negotiation that often goes on In the workplace for example theres often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss or refer to him or her on a firstname basis If two friends have a reciprocal transaction like selling a car its well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness In dating the transition from friendship to sex can lead to notoriously various forms of awkwardness and as can sex in the workplace in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship sexual harassment Well what does this have to do with language Well language as a social interaction has to satisfy two conditions You have to convey the actual content  here we get back to the container metaphor You want to express the bribe the command the promise the solicitation and so on but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person The solution I think is that we use language at two levels the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener whereas the implicated content  the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform  allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context which possibly initiates a changed relationship The simplest example of this is in the polite request If you express your request as a conditional  if you could open the window that would be great  even though the content is an imperative the fact that youre not using the imperative voice means that youre not acting as if youre in a relationship of dominance where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person On the other hand you want the damn guacamole By expressing it as an ifthen statement you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around And in a more subtle way I think this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability the bribes threats propositions solicitations and so on One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language  where it could only be used literally And you can think of it in terms of a gametheoretic payoff matrix Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer Theres a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer If you dont bribe the officer then you will get a traffic ticket  or as is the case of Fargo worse  whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest Nothing ventured nothing gained In that case the consequences are rather severe On the other hand if you extend the bribe if the officer is dishonest you get a huge payoff of going free If the officer is honest you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery So this is a rather fraught situation On the other hand with indirect language if you issue a veiled bribe then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe in which case you get the payoff of going free The honest officer cant hold you to it as being a bribe and therefore you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket So you get the best of both worlds And a similar analysis I think can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset I think this affirms something thats long been known by diplomats  namely that the vagueness of language far from being a bug or an imperfection actually might be a feature of language one that we use to our advantage in social interactions So to sum up language is a collective human creation reflecting human nature how we conceptualize reality how we relate to one another And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

165,So where are the robots Weve been told for  years already that theyre coming soon Very soon theyll be doing everything for us Theyll be cooking cleaning buying things shopping building But they arent here Meanwhile we have illegal immigrants doing all the work but we dont have any robots So what can we do about that What can we say So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way And this is an xray picture of a real beetle and a Swiss watch back from  You look at that  what was true then is certainly true today We can still make the pieces We can make the right pieces We can make the circuitry of the right computational power but we cant actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems So lets try to look at it from a different perspective Lets summon the best designer the mother of all designers Lets see what evolution can do for us So we threw in  we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots  with bars with motors with neurons Put them all together and put all this under kind of natural selection under mutation and rewarded things for how well they can move forward A very simple task and its interesting to see what kind of things came out of that So if you look you can see a lot of different machines come out of this They all move around They all crawl in different ways and you can see on the right that we actually made a couple of these things and they work in reality These are not very fantastic robots but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for for moving forward So that was all done in simulation but we can also do that on a real machine Heres a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains competing or evolving on the machine Its like a rodeo show They all get a ride on the machine and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet but they gradually learn how to move forward and they do this autonomously So in these two examples we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation and also machines that learned how to walk in reality But I want to show you a different approach and this is this robot over here which has four legs It has eight motors four on the knees and four on the hip It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way its tilting But this machine doesnt know what it looks like You look at it and you see it has four legs the machine doesnt know if its a snake if its a tree it doesnt have any idea what it looks like but its going to try to find that out Initially it does some random motion and then it tries to figure out what it might look like And youre seeing a lot of things passing through its minds a lot of selfmodels that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models like a scientist in a lab Then it does that and tries to explain that and prune out its selfmodels This is the last cycle and you can see its pretty much figured out what its self looks like And once it has a selfmodel it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion So what youre seeing here are a couple of machines  a pattern of locomotion We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil spidery walk but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward But when you look at that you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward nor did it have a model of itself It kind of figured out what it looks like and how to move forward and then actually tried that out So well move forward to a different idea So that was what happened when we had a couple of  thats what happened when you had a couple of  OK OK OK   they dont like each other So theres a different robot Thats what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something What happens if you dont reward them for anything you just throw them in So we have these cubes like the diagram showed here The cube can swivel or flip on its side and we just throw  of these cubes into a soup  this is in simulation and dont reward them for anything we just let them flip We pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations So initially nothing happens theyre just flipping around there But after a very short while you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over They begin to selfreplicate So in absence of any reward the intrinsic reward is selfreplication And weve actually built a couple of these and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes Its an accelerated view where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process So youre feeding it with more material  cubes in this case  and more energy and it can make another robot So of course this is a very crude machine but were working on a microscale version of these and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in OK so what can we learn These robots are of course not very useful in themselves but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots and perhaps how humans animals create selfmodels and learn And one of the things that I think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually but actually let them evolve and learn like children and perhaps thats the way well get there Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

167,The advances that have taken place in astronomy cosmology and biology in the last  years are really extraordinary  to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works than many of you might imagine But there was something else that Ive noticed as those changes were taking place as people were starting to find out that hmm  yeah there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy The science writers and editors  I shouldnt say science writers I should say people who write about science  and editors would sit down over a couple of beers after a hard day of work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly And thats what I want to talk about today Laughter Ah you laugh you fools Laughter Voice Can we finish up a little early Laughter Yeah we need the time Stephen Petranek At first it all seemed a little fantastical to me but after challenging a lot of these ideas I began to take a lot of them seriously And then September  happened and I thought ah God I cant go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end Nobody wants to hear that Not after this And that got me into a discussion with some other people other scientists about maybe some other subjects and one of the guys I talked to who was a neuroscientist said You know I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up and reminds me of Michaels talk yesterday and his mother saying you cant have a solution if you dont have a problem So we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow and lo and behold we found them Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago Can we run that Andrew President George W Bush Whatever it costs to defend our security and whatever it costs to defend our freedom we must pay it SP I agree with the president He wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year a twotrilliondollar federal budget which will land us back into deficit spending real fast But terrorists arent the only threat we face There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that were in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism and what couldve happened on September  I would propose therefore that if we took  billion dollars from that  trillion dollar budget  which is two one hundredths of that budget  and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems Im going to talk to you about the vast majority could be solved and the rest we could deal with So I hope you find this both fascinating  Im fascinated by this kind of stuff I gotta admit  to me these are Richards cockroaches But I also hope because I think the people in this room can literally change the world I hope you take some of this stuff away with you and when you have an opportunity to be influential that you try to get some heavyduty money spent on some of these ideas So lets start Number  we lose the will to survive We live in an incredible age of modern medicine We are all much healthier than we were  years ago People around the world are getting better medicine  but mentally were falling apart The World Health Organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed And the World Health Organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced Soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of  as a normal lifespan A female child born tomorrow on average  median  will live to age  Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes Now the problem with all of this getting older is that people over  are the most likely people to commit suicide So what are the solutions We dont really have mental health insurance in this country and its  Applause  its really a crime Something like  percent of all people with depression and I mean really severe depression  I have a friend with stunningly severe depression  this is a curable disease with present medicine and present technology But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills Pills alone dont do it especially in clinically depressed people You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist and put down your dollar copay and get treated just like you do when you got a cut on your arm Its ridiculous Secondly drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs We know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did  years ago We need a pumppush from the federal government through NIH and National Science  NSF  and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs Moving on Number nine  dont laugh  aliens invade Earth Ten years ago you couldnt have found an astronomer  well very few astronomers  in the world who wouldve told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system  we found three The count now is up to   were finding about two or three a month All of the ones weve found by the way are in this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the Milky Way There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years and was laughed at for it there must be billions and billions in the universe In a few years NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter where theres less dust and start looking for Earthlike planets which we cannot see with present technology nor detect Its becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe and probably fairly close to us is a fairly remote idea And the chance that some of it isnt more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea Remember weve only been an advanced civilization  an industrial civilization if you would  for  years Although every time I go to Pompeii Im amazed that they had the equivalent of a McDonalds on every street corner too So I dont know how much civilization really has progressed since AD  but theres a great likelihood I really believe this and I dont believe in aliens and I dont believe there are any aliens on the Earth or anything like that But theres a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own Now what will happen What if they come to you know suck up our oceans for the hydrogen And swat us away like flies the way we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it We can look at our own history The late physicist Gerard ONeill said Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the primitive civilization If the aliens come visiting were the primitive civilization So what are the solutions to this Laughter Thank God you can all read It may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species Secondly  and youre going to hear more from me about this  we have to become an outwardlooking spacefaring nation We have got to develop the idea that the Earth doesnt last forever our sun doesnt last forever If we want humanity to last forever we have to colonize the Milky Way And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point Itll also help us a lot if we meet an advanced civilization along the way if were trying to be an advanced civilization Number eight  Voice Steve thats what Im doing after TED Laughter Applause SP Youve got it Youve got the job Number eight the ecosystem collapses Last July in Science the journal Science  oceanographers published a very very unusual article It wasnt really a research report it was a screed They said weve been looking at the oceans for a long time now and we want to tell you theyre not in trouble theyre near collapse Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real real danger Were living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of  We have lost  percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last  years California is expected to lose  percent of its species in the next  years Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree You cut down that tree the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem Theres really a tree like that out there Thats really what it comes to And when that ecosystem collapses it could take a major ecosystem with it like our atmosphere So what do we do about this What are the solutions There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly that we dont know theyre really in trouble until its almost too late We need to know earlier that theyre getting in trouble and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models And with the kind of computing power we have now there is as I say some of this going on but it needs money National Science Foundation needs to say  you know almost all the money thats spent on science in this country comes from the federal government one way or another And they get to prioritize you know There are people at the National Science Foundation who get to say this is the most important thing This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about Secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around Theres been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland Its a notake fishing zone They cant fish there for a radius of  miles And an amazing thing has happened almost all the fish have come back and theyre reproducing like crazy Were going to have to start doing this around the globe Were going to have to have notake zones Were going to have to say no more logging in the Amazon for  years Let it recover before we start logging again Number seven particle accelerator mishap You all remember Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world A lot of very soberminded physicists believe it or not have had exactly the same thought This spring  theres a collider at Brookhaven on Long Island  this spring its going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes They are expecting to create little tiny black holes They expect them to evaporate Laughter I hope theyre right Laughter Other collider experiments  theres one thats going to take place next summer at CERN  have the possibility of creating something called strangelets which are kind of like antimatter Whenever they hit other matter they destroy it and obliterate it Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets that we need to worry about and theyre probably right But all around the world in Japan in Canada theres talk about this of reviving this in the United States We shut one down that was going to be big But theres talk of building very big accelerators What can we do about this What are the solutions Weve got the fox watching the henhouse here We need to  we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging of whats going on with these experiments Secondly we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth and its constantly bombarded by highenergy particles like protons And in my opinion we dont spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first whats safe to do on Earth Number six biotech disaster Its one of my favorite ones because weve done several stories on Bt corn Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer You may of heard of it  heard it called StarLink especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States and it got into the human food supply and somebody shouldve figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily But the thing thats alarming is a couple of months ago in Mexico where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants Now corn originated we think in Mexico This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world from biotechnology that literally could destroy the worlds food supply in very short order So what do we do about that We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants Its that simple This is an amazingly unregulated field When the StarLink disaster happened there was a battle between the EPA and the FDA over who really had authority and over what parts of this and they didnt get it straightened out for months Thats kind of crazy Number five one of my favorites reversal of the Earths magnetic field Believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years and has happened many times in our history North Pole goes to the South South Pole goes to the North and vice versa But what happens as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about  years and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this field protects us from are  well basically were gonna fry Laughter Voice Steve I have some additional hats downstairs SP So what can we do about this Oh by the way were overdue Its been  years since this happened So it should have happened about  years ago Oh and heres one other thing Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent So maybe were in the throes of it One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is is that we have  you know we dont have good weather data from  years ago much less data on things like the ozone layer So theres a fairly simple solution to this Theres going to be a lot of cheap rocketry thats going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply You know we can make ozone from car tailpipes Its not hard its just three oxygen atoms If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth it would be the thickness of two pennies at  pounds per square inch You dont need that much up there We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earths ozone layer Number four giant solar flares Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun that bombard the Earth with highspeed subatomic particles So far our atmosphere has done and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this Occasionally we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc with communications and so forth and electricity But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our Sun and theyve found that a number of them when theyre about the age of our Sun brighten by a factor of as much as  Doesnt last for very long And they think these are superflares millions of times more powerful than any flares weve had from our Sun so far Obviously we dont want one of those Laughter Theres a flip side to it In studying stars like our Sun weve found that they go through periods of diminishment when their total amount of energy thats expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent One percent doesnt sound like a lot but it would cause one hell of an ice age here So what can we do about this Laughter Start terraforming Mars This is one of my favorite subjects I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in  This is rocket science but its not hard rocket science Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars and to make a livable planet on Mars is probably there And you just literally have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen The problem is it takes  years to terraform Mars minimum Really more like  years to do it right Theres no reason why we shouldnt start now Laughter Number three  isnt this stuff cool Laughter A new global epidemic People have been at war with germs ever since there have been people and from time to time the germs sure get the upper hand In  we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed  million people That was back when the population was around  million people The bubonic plague in Europe in the Middle Ages killed one out of four Europeans AIDS is coming back Ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics Weve all learned what  the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head like anthrax The worst possibility is that a very simple germ like staph for which we have one antibiotic that still works mutates And we know staph can do amazing things A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come and change and mutate The danger is that some germ like staph will be  will mutate into something thats really virulent very contagious and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it Thats happened before About  years ago there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas and that is thought to have been a virulent disease So what can we do about it It is nuts We give antibiotics  Applause  every cow every lamb every chicken they get antibiotics every day all You know you go to a restaurant you eat fish I got news for you its all farmed You know you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if its a wild fish cause theyre not going to tell you Were giving away the code This is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code Were telling the germs out there how to fight us We gotta fix that We gotta outlaw that right away Secondly our public health system as we saw with anthrax is a real disaster We have a real major outbreak of disease in the United States we are not prepared to cope with it Now there is money in the federal budget next year to build up the public health service But I dont think to any extent that it really needs to be done Number two  my favorite  we meet a rogue black hole You know  years ago or  years ago really you walk into an astronomy convention and you say You know theres probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy and theyre going to hoot you off the stage And now if you went into one of those conventions and you said Well I dont think black holes are out there theyd hoot you off the stage Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really  has just gained unbelievably in recent years We think that there are about  million dead stars in the Milky Way alone our galaxy And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like   miles wide and they are black holes And they are gobbling up everything around them including light which is why we cant see them Most of them should be in orbit around something But galaxies are very violent places and things can be spun out of orbit And also space is incredibly vast So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote But it only has to get close about a billion miles away one of these things About a billion miles away heres what happens to Earths orbit it becomes elliptical instead of circular And for three months out of the year the surface temperatures go up to  to  For three months out of the year they go to  below zero That wont work too well What can we do about this And this is my scariest Laughter I dont have a good answer for this one Again we gotta think about being a colonizing race And finally number one biggest danger to life as we know it I think a really big asteroid heads for Earth The important thing to remember here  this is not a question of if this is a question of when and how big In  just a foot piece of a comet exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe  miles It had the effect of about  Hiroshima bombs Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years In  a large asteroid passed  miles away from Earth Nothing to worry about right It passed directly through Earths orbit We were in that that spot six hours earlier A small asteroid say a half mile wide would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up  Carl Sagans nuclear winter thing An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide Where are they Theres something called the Kuiper belt which  some people think Plutos not a planet thats where Pluto is its in the Kuiper belt Theres also something a little farther out called the Oort cloud There are about  balls of ice and rock  comets really  out there that are  miles in diameter or more and they regularly take a little spin in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us Of more concern I think is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall  theyre making the first map of the universe threedimensional map of the universe  that there are probably  asteroids between Mars and Jupiter that are a half a mile big or bigger So you say yeah well what are really the chances of this happening Andrew can you put that chart up This is a chart that Dr Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute presented to Congress a few years ago Youll notice that the chance of an asteroidslashcomet impact killing you is about one in  according to the work theyve done Now look at the one right below that Passenger aircraft crash one in  We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we dont die in airplane accidents and were not spending hardly anything on this And yet this is completely preventable We finally have just in the last year the technology to stop this cold Could we have the solutions NASAs spending three million dollars a year three million bucks  that is like pocket change  to search for asteroids Because we can actually figure out every asteroid thats out there and if it might hit Earth and when it might hit Earth And theyre trying to do that But its going to take them  years at spending three million dollars a year and even then they claim theyll only have about  percent of them catalogued Comets are a tougher act We dont really have the technology to predict comet trajectories or when one with our name on it might arrive But we would have lots of time if we see it coming We really need a dedicated observatory Youll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of amateur astronomers Thats because nobodys looking for them except amateurs We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets Part two of the solutions we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid or alter its trajectory Now a year ago we did an amazing thing We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt called NEAR Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous And these guys orbited a   or no about a mile long asteroid called Eros And then of course you know they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything and then at the last minute they landed When the mission was over they actually landed on the thing We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid Its not a big deal Now the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you dont have anything to push against in space because theres no air A nuclear explosion is just as hot but we dont really have anything big enough to melt a mile long asteroid or vaporize it would be more like it But we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it which would gently slowly after a period of time push it into a different trajectory which if weve done our math right would keep it from hitting Earth This is just a matter of finding em going there and doing something about it I know your head is spinning from all this stuff Yikes So many big threats The thing I think to remember is September  We dont want to get caught flatfooted again We know about this stuff Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now Knowledge is power The worst thing we can do is say jeez I got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid Laughter Thats a mistake that could literally cost us our future Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

168,I have  minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years All right We all have come from a long way here in Africa and converged in this region of Africa which is a place where  percent of our evolutionary process took place And I say that not because I am African but its in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors upright walking traces even the first technologies in the form of stone tools So we all are Africans and welcome home All right Im a paleoanthropologist and my job is to define mans place in nature and explore what makes us human And today I will use Selam the earliest child ever discovered to tell you a story of all of us Selam is our most complete skeleton of a threeyearold girl who lived and died  million years ago She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis You dont need to remember that Thats the Lucy species and was found by my research team in December of  in an area called Dikika Its in the northeastern part of Ethiopia And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance I think After I was invited by TED I did some digging because thats what we do to know about my host You dont just jump into an invitation And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools  million years ago First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are  years old And evidence for first design comes  years old  beads And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over  percent of the same genetic material I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry However DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end telling us nothing about what happened in the middle So for us paleoanthropologists our job is to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development Because its only when you do that that you can talk about  Laughter  its only when you do that that you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time That then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor Its a systematic and scientific approach which takes you to places that are remote hot hostile and often with no access Just to give you an example when I went to Dikika where Selam was found in   and its about  kilometers from Addis Ababa the capital of Ethiopia It took us only seven hours to do the first  kilometers of the  but took four solid hours to do the last only  kilometers With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks I made my way I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot When you get there this is what you see and its the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable And once you make it there the big question is where to start And you find nothing for years and years When I go to places like this which are paleontological sites its like going to a game park an extinct game park But what you find are not the human remains such as Selam and Lucy on a daytoday basis You find elephants rhinos monkeys pigs etc But you could ask how could these large mammals live in this desert environment Of course they cannot but Im telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this Anyway once we made it there then its a game park as I said an extinct game park And our ancestors lived in that game park but were just the minorities They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are To tell you just an example an anecdote about their rarity I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here and the assistants of course helped me do the surveys They would find a bone and tell me Here is what youre looking for I would say No thats an elephant Again another one Thats a monkey Thats a pig etc So one of my assistants who never went to school said to me Listen Zeray You either dont know what youre looking for or youre looking in the wrong place he said And I said Why Because there were elephants and lions and the people were scared and went somewhere else Lets go somewhere else Well he was very tired and its really tiring It was then after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam and you see the face here covered by sandstone And here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block because she was buried by a river What you have here seems to be nothing but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology an amazing piece of our long long history There were these three people and me and I am taking the pictures thats why I am not in How would you feel if you were me You have something extraordinary in your hand but you are in the middle of nowhere The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility of making sure everything is safe Here is a closeup of the fossil after five years of cleaning preparation and description which was very long as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide It took five years In a way this was like the second birth for the child after  million years but the labor was very long And here is full scale  its a tiny bone And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there And you see me worried and trying to protect my child because you dont leave anyone with this kind of child even a minister So then once youve done that the next stage is to know what it is Once that was done then it was possible to compare We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs the foot and some features clearly showed that she walked upright and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity But in addition if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here you see that you have vertical forehead And you see that in humans because of the development of the prefrontal cortex its called You dont see that in chimpanzees and you dont see this very projecting canine So she belongs to our family tree but within that of course you do detailed analysis and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species known as Australopithecus afarensis The next exciting question is girl or boy And how old was she when she died You can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth How You know in primates there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females But to do that you need the permanent dentition which you dont see here because what you have here are the baby teeth But using the CT scanning technology which is normally used for medical purposes you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the stillgrowing adult teeth here So when you measure those teeth it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth And to know how old she was when she died what you do is you do an informed estimate and you say how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth and the answer was three So this girl died when she was about three  million years ago So with all that information the big question is  what do we actually  what does she tell us To answer this question we can phrase another question What do we actually know about our ancestors We want to know how they looked like how they behaved how they walked around and how they lived and grew up And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included first this skeleton documents for the first time how infants looked over three million years ago And second she tells us that she walked upright but had some adaptation for tree climbing And more interesting however is the brain in this child was still growing At age three if you have a stillgrowing brain its a human behavior In chimps by age three the brain is formed over  percent Thats why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth  faster than us anyway But in humans we continue to grow our brains Thats why we need care from our parents But that care means also you learn You spend more time with your parents And thats very characteristic of humans and its called childhood which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents So the stillgrowing brain in this individual tells us that childhood which requires an incredible social organization a very complex social organization emerged over three million years ago So by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human But not everything was human and I will give you a very exciting example This is called the hyoid bone Its a bone which is right here It supports your tongue from behind Its in a way your voice box It determines the type of voice you produce It was not known in the fossil record and we have it in this skeleton When we did the analysis of this bone it was clear that it looked very chimplike chimpanzeelike So if you were there  million years ago to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human Maybe youre wondering So you see this ape feature human feature ape feature What does that tell us You know that is very exciting for us because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively and that evolution is in the making To summarize the significance of this fossil we can say the following Up to now the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils the baby fossils were missing They dont preserve well as you know So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors on how they looked like how they behaved was kind of biased toward adults Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth and you hide all the babies the children and he goes back and reports Can you imagine how much biased his report would be Thats what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children so I think the new fossil fixes this problem So I think the most important question at the end is what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general Of course in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human you know the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years  and there are more than   they did not have the knowledge the technology and sophistications that we Homo sapiens have today But if this species ancient species would travel in time and see us today they would very much be very proud of their legacy because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe And they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great Now the question is we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet possibly more So the question is are we up to the challenge And can we really do better than these primitive smallbrained ancestors Among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa Needless to list them here and there are more competent people to talk about this Still in my opinion we have two choices One is to continue to see a poor ill crying Africa carrying guns that depends on other people forever or to promote an Africa which is confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time I am for the second option and Im sure many of you are And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa Thats because we Africans concentrate  I am from Ethiopia by the way  we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere or from outside I think its important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves Thats what I call positive African attitude So finally I would like to say so lets help Africa walk upright and forward then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

170,Ive actually been waiting by the phone for a call from TED for years And in fact in  I was ready to talk about eBay but no call In  I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship No call In  I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year and no call And finally I get a call last year and then I have to go up after JJ Abrams Youve got a cruel sense of humor TED When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley I had some misgivings But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood And in fact some advantages to owning your own media company And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed Hollywood has its sex symbols and the Valley has its sex symbols Hollywood has its rivalries and the Valley has its rivalries Hollywood gathers around power tables and the Valley gathers around power tables So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed But Im actually here today to tell a story And part of it is a personal story When Chris invited me to speak he said people think of you as a bit of an enigma and they want to know what drives you a bit And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share Its a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call Humanity  And its also something that resides in each of us to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today One is the gap in opportunity  this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven unfair and unsustainable  and out of that comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us But perhaps the other bigger gap is what we call the hope gap And someone at some point came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldnt make a difference in the world And I think thats just a horrible thing And so chapter one really begins today with all of us because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps And if the men and women of TED cant make a difference in the world I dont know who can And for me a lot of this started when I was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate New York And there really wasnt much to do there for the summer except get beaten up by my sister or read books And so I used to read authors like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place And it struck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected that maybe I could get people interested in the issues that affected us all and maybe engage them to make a difference I didnt think that was necessarily the best way to make a living so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent so I could write these stories as quickly as I could I then had a bit of a wakeup call when I was  And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer and it looked pretty bad And what he said was he wasnt so much afraid that he might die but that he hadnt done the things that he wanted to with his life And knock on wood hes still alive today many years later But for a young man that made a real impression on me that one never knows how much time one really has So I set out in a hurry I studied engineering I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move which is very well named because people kept stealing the computers So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there And while I was there I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar who is here today And Pierre I apologize for this This is a photo from the old days And just after Id graduated Pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree I said Pierre what a stupid idea And needless to say I was right But right after that Pierre  in  Pierre and I left our fulltime jobs to build eBay as a company And the rest of that story you know The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries and so on But for me personally it was a real change I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources And I wanted to figure out how I could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world And around that time I met John Gardner who is a remarkable man He was the architect of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson in the s And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do or anyone could do to make a difference in the longterm issues facing humanity And John said Bet on good people doing good things Bet on good people doing good things And that really resonated with me I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things These leading innovative nonprofit folks who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems People today we call social entrepreneurs And to put a face on it people like Muhammad Yunus who started the Grameen Bank has lifted  million people plus out of poverty around the world won the Nobel Peace Prize But theres also a lot of people that you dont know Folks like Ann Cotton who started a group called CAMFED in Africa because she felt girls education was lagging And she started it about  years ago and today she educates over a quarter million African girls And somebody like Dr Victoria Hale who started the worlds first nonprofit pharmaceutical company and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis also known as black fever And by  she hopes to eliminate this disease which is really a scourge in the developing world And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful Its what we call Invest connect and celebrate And invest if you see good people doing good things invest in them Invest in their organizations or in business Invest in these folks Connecting them together through conferences  like a TED  brings so many powerful connections or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year And celebrate them tell their stories because not only are there good people doing good work but their stories can help close these gaps of hope And it was this last part of the mission the celebrate part that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all And a light bulb went off which was first that I didnt actually have to do the writing myself I could find writers And then the next light bulb was better than just writing what about film and TV to get out to people in a big way And I thought about the films that inspired me films like Gandhi and Schindlers List And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today And there really wasnt a specific company that was focused on the public interest So in  I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a prosocial media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you who think youre going to come to this town and make movies And then of course there was the other adage The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business Undeterred in January of  I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change And we dont just want people to see our movies and say that was fun and forget about it We want them to actually get involved in the issues In  we launched our first slate of films Murder Ball North Country Syriana and Good Night and Good Luck And much to my surprise they were noticed We ended up with  Oscar nominations for these films And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy Perhaps more importantly tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies And we had an online component of that our community sect called Participatenet But with our social sector partners like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC once people saw the film there was actually something they could do to make a difference One of these films in particular called North Country was actually kind of a box office disaster But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about womens rights womens empowerment domestic violence and so on And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act And with screenings on the Hill and discussions and with our social sector partners like the National Organization of Women the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act And that to me spoke volumes because its  the film started about a truelife story about a woman who was harassed sued her employer led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act and the Violence Against Women Act and others And then the movie about this person doing these things then led to this greater renewal And so again it goes back to betting on good people doing good things Speaking of which our fellow TEDster Al  I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of  At that point I thought I knew something about global warming I thought it was a  to  year problem And after we saw his slide show it became clear that it was much more urgent And so right afterwards I met backstage with Al and with Lawrence Bender who was there and Laurie David and Davis Guggenheim who was running documentaries for Participant at the time And with Als blessing we decided on the spot to turn it into a film because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world speaking to audiences of  or  at a time And you know theres another adage in Hollywood that nobody knows nothing about anything And I really thought this was going to be a straighttoPBS charitable initiative And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland and most of Scandinavia Weve sent  DVDs to high school teachers in the US and its really changed the debate on global warming It was also a pretty good year for this guy We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming And for Participant this is just the start Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world And we have  films in production right now and dozens others in development Ill quickly talk about a few coming up One is Charlie Wilsons War with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts And its the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan And were also doing a movie called The Kite Runner based on the book The Kite Runner also about Afghanistan And we think once people see these films theyll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general We premiered a film called The Chicago  at Sundance this year Its based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in  Abby Hoffman and crew and again a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world And a documentary that were doing on Jimmy Carter and his MidEast peace efforts over the years And in particular weve been following him on his recent book tour which as many of you know has been very noncontroversial   which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie In closing Id like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives or their philanthropic work or their other interests And one thing that Ive learned is that theres never one right way to make change One can do it as a tech person or as a finance person or a nonprofit person or as an entertainment person but every one of us is all of those things and more And I believe if we do these things we can close the opportunity gaps we can close the hope gaps And I can imagine if we do this the headlines in  years might read something like these New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero US Imports its Last Barrel of Oil   Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate  Years of Peaceful Coexistence And I like this one Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro And finally an eBay listing for one welltraveled slide show now obsolete museum piece Please contact Al Gore And I believe that working together we can make all of these things happen And I want to thank you all for having me here today Its been a real honor Thank you Oh thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

171,Three years ago I got a phone call based on an earlier film I had made with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard My idea  and literally I woke up in the middle of the night and weve all have those moments You know you go to sleep  I was excited with this phone call I was thinking I just finished making another film about World War II vets and I realized Id gotten to know their stories and I realized this was a onceinalifetime opportunity to tell a warriors story as it unfolded So I went to bed that night pretty excited Not sure of all the details but excited It wasnt at four in the morning but it was closer to midnight Woke straight up Wideawake as could be And I had this idea what if I could in effect virtually embed and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers To tell the story from the inside out versus the outside in So I called back Major Heilshorn whos the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard And he knew me so I was like Greg Hes like Yes Deborah Told him my idea and you know he is one of the bravest men in the world as is General Blair who in the end gave me permission to try this experiment Within  days I was down at Fort Dix He gave me my pick of units I picked one unit  Charlie Company Third of the nd theyre mountain infantry  for two reasons One theyre infantry Number two they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda so I knew they would have Internet access The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer This was a big thing that I think when Major H told me I wasnt really totally gathering what that would mean So what that meant was when I went down to Fort Dix I had to hop out in front of  guys and tell them of my vision You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got The opening one was What the fuck do you know about the National Guard I started with the  Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars Gave them about a nine minute response and there we went So Id like to show the clip of the film Its our trailer because I know obviously you guys are busy many of you may not have had a chance to see it So I want to show the trailer and then Im going to take apart one scene in detail If we could roll Video Stephen Pink This is Sergeant Stephen Pink Michael Moriarty Specialist Michael Moriarty Zack Bazzi Do I really want to go Probably not Soldier Were not supposed to talk to the media SP Im not the media dammit MM The day is here Life will change Voice The real deal man Narrator You ready Soldier Bring it on Narrator You ready Voice  Iraq here we come ZB Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat Its natural instinct SP If you let fear get to you then youre not going to be doing your job MM Every single time you go out there theres attacks Its unbelievable ZB Hey Nestor your ass crack is right in my face Soldiers IV Are we on fire IV Man down Man down MM Keep going brother You wanna play Michael Moriartys Wife Its really hard for him to not have his dad MM This little kid is in the middle of a war zone Stephen Pinks Girlfriend In the beginning hes like Write something dirty George W Bush The worlds newest democracy MM Theyre shooting at me SP You dont put  troops in there and say were there to create democracy Soldier Weve got a drive through window at Burger King now SP Were here to create money MM I support George Bush Were not there for the oil Jon Baril The worst thing in my life SP Baril dont look at it bud Michael Moriartys Wife Hes not the same person anymore MM I will not go back Kevin Shangraw The Iraqi people are who we are there to help  and we just killed one Soldiers Sergeant Smith is down Sergeant Smith is down There they are Right there Fire fire JB Itll be a better country in  years cause we were there I hope Applause Deborah Scranton Thank you One of the things Id like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about And Id like to relate an experience I had here at TED I dont know how many of you might imagine it but theres actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq Paul Come on stand up This is Paul Anthony He served  Applause  with the Marines and I want to tell you a little brief story We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software Right And we started talking People will see my tag and theyll see The War Tapes and then well start talking about war We got in a conversation with some other people in the class and it went on and on I mean we were there for an hour talking And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with which is I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war and about politics And really  because maybe were going to disagree Maybe its going to get uncomfortable How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation And you know Paul was talking and he then turned to Constance and said You know I wouldnt have this conversation if she werent here because I know she has my back And I want to say I was nervous Because Im used to doing QampAs I really related to what James was saying yesterday because Im behind the camera You know I can answer questions about my movie but for me to come up and talk for  minutes is a really long time So I wanted to say Paul Im happy youre here because I know you have my back This film was not about the Internet but it could not have been made without it The guys tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me In the meantime the soldiers  we would email and IM I didnt save all of them because I didnt realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of But there were  emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it So I wanted to show you a clip and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together If we could roll the clip Video SP Today is sport Unclear Radio Unclear Christian soldiers SP We like to give these insurgents a fair chance So what we do we ride with the windows down Because you know we obviously have the advantage Im just kidding We dont fucking ride with the goddam windows down Its not true Very unsafe Whoa Soldier Right there SP All right lets get over to that site Be advised were leaving Taji right now We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji were heading to that location now Soldier Thats a fucking car bomb Soldier Motherfuckers Soldiers Get your vest on Hey get over the fucking  yeah yeah Any onefour elements get to the gate SP Sheriff onesix or any onefour elements we need you at the gate of Taji right now over Soldier Ill walk you through it Voices SP Stay low Head over to the right Get your bag get your bag Screams SP It was mass casualties Probably  dead at least  or  wounded Iraqis SP It just looked like you know someone had thrown a quarter through a guy and it was just like  there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds Everything was cauterized and it was just like there was a void going through the body This is the scene north They just removed a burnt body or half a body from here I dont think there was anything left from his abdominal down This is blood And you know you walk and you hear the pieces of skin And thats it thats all thats left I remember giving three IVs bandaging several wounded Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall shaking and screaming Medics who were terrified and couldnt perform I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji They can work on the post for pennies but cant die there Theyve got to die outside If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment I wouldve slit his throat right there  hours and its just our squad going through todays events in our heads whether we want to or not News Anchor More violence in Iraq Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad SP We made the news I feel exploited and proud at the same time Ive lost all faith in the media  a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass Ill do that then Im gonna jerk off Because these pages smell like Linds and there wont be any time for jerking off tomorrow Another mission at  DS Now  Applause  thanks When I said earlier to try and tell a story from the inside out versus the outside in  part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction  is this melding Its a new way of trying to make a documentary When I met the guys and  of them agreed to take cameras  in total  ended up filming Five soldiers filmed the entire time There are three featured in the film The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email and in it attached a photo of that burned body out at the car And the tone from the email was you know it had been a very bad day obviously And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base So I pinged Mike and I said Mike can you please go get that interview with Pink Because the thing that very often is missing is in the military what they call hot wash Its that immediate interview after something immediately happens you know And if you let time go by it kind of softens and smooths the edges And for me I really wanted that So in order to get the intimacy to share that experience with you the guys  the two most popular mounts  there was a camera on the turret the gun turret and then on the dashboard of the Humvee Most of the Humvees we ended up mounting two cameras in them So you get to experience that in real time right The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within  hours of that episode happening Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home I knew about that journal but it was very very private And you know you earn someones trust especially in doc filmmaking through your relationship So it wasnt until five months after he was home that he would read that journal Now the news footage I put in there to try to show  you know I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times American soldiers saying Why dont they talk about the good stuff that we do OK this is a perfect example Pinks squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire They didnt have to go outside the wire There were not Americans hurt out there They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives  the Iraqis who work on the post So when you may hear soldiers complaining thats what theyre talking about you know And I think its such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different QampAs and people are really opinionated But it seems like people dont want to hear so much or listen or try to have an exchange And Im as fiery as the next person but I really think  you know different speakers have talked about their concern for the world and my concern is that we have to have these conversations And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may you know we think we know But we just have to leave that little bit of openness to know Theres such a disconnect And for me its trying to bridge that disconnect Ill share one story I get  Im often asked you know for me what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film And at screenings inevitably  you know as Im sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff  usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions And usually the first questions are Oh what kind of cameras did you use Or you know these things But theres always a few guys almost always who are the last ones And Ive learned over time that those are always the soldiers And they wait until pretty much everybodys gone And for me one of the most profound stories someone shared with me that then became my story was  for those of you who havent seen the film and its not a spoiler  its very common there are a lot of civilian accidents where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed In this film there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed A soldier came up to me and stood you know really pretty close a foot away from me Hes a big guy And he looked at me and I smiled and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes And he wasnt going to blink And he said My gunner was throwing candy And I knew what he was going to say The gunner was throwing candy They used to throw candy to the kids Kids got too close very often And he said I killed a child And Im a father I have children I havent been able to tell my wife Im afraid shes going to think Im a monster I hugged him of course and I said you know Its going to be OK And he said Im going to bring her to see your film And then Im going to tell her So when I talk about a disconnect its not only for maybe those people who dont know a soldier which there obviously are You know these days its not like World War II where there was a war front and a home front and everybody seemed involved You can go for days here and not feel like theres a war going on And often Ill hear people say who maybe know that I did this film and they say Oh you know Im against the war but I support the soldiers And Ive started to ask them Well thats nice What are you doing Are you volunteering at a VA You go and see anybody Do you if you find out your neighbors been do you spend some time Not necessarily ask questions but see if they want to talk Do you give money to any of the charities You know obviously like Dean Kamens working on that amazing thing but theres charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers I think I challenge us to say  to operationalize those terms when we say we support someone you know Are you a friend to them Do you really care And I would just say its my hope and I would ask you guys to please you know reach out a hand And really do give them a hug Thank you ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

172,On simplicity What a great way to start First of all Ive been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such For Dummies Do you know these books these such and such For Dummies My daughters pointed out that Im very similar looking so this is a bit of a problem But I was looking online at Amazoncom for other books like this You know theres also something called the Complete Idiots Guide Theres a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense We like to have technology make us feel bad for some strange reason But I really like that so I wrote a book called The Laws of Simplicity I was in Milan last week for the Italian launch Its kind of a book about questions questions about simplicity Very few answers Im also wondering myself what is simplicity Is it good Is it bad Is complexity better Im not sure After I wrote The Laws of Simplicity I was very tired of simplicity as you can imagine And so in my life Ive discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of overachiever Because your companies will always take away your life but they can never take away your vacation  in theory So I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity and I went to the Gap because I only have black pants So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever and unfortunately their branding was all about Keep It Simple I opened up a magazine and Visas branding was Business Takes Simplicity I develop photographs and Kodak said Keep It Simple So I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around So I turned on the TV and I dont watch TV very much but you know this person This is Paris Hilton apparently And she has this show The Simple Life So I watched this Its not very simple a little bit confusing So I looked for a different show to watch So I opened up this TV Guide thing and on the E channel this Simple Life show is very popular Theyll play it over and over and over So it was traumatizing actually So I wanted to escape again so I went out to my car And Cape Cod there are idyllic roads and all of us can drive in this room And when you drive these signs are very important Its a very simple sign it says road and road approaching So Im mostly driving along okay and then I saw this sign So I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly so I thought Ah simplicity Very important But then I thought Oh simplicity What would that be like on a beach What if the sky was  percent gray Wouldnt that be the perfect sky I mean that simplicity sky But in reality the sky looked like this It was a beautiful complex sky You know with the pinks and blues We cant help but love complexity Were human beings we love complex things We love relationships  very complex So we love this kind of stuff Im at this place called the Media Lab Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place Its designed by I M Pei one of the premier modernist architects Modernism means white box and its a perfect white box And some of you guys are entrepreneurs etc whatever Last month I was at Google and boy that cafeteria man You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options See in academia we get titles lots of titles Last year at TED these were all my titles I had a lot of titles I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters This year at TED Im happy to report that I have new titles in addition to my previous titles Another Associate Director of Research And this also happened so I have five daughters now Thats my baby Reina Applause Thank you And so my life is much more complex because of the baby actually but thats okay We will still stay married I think But looking way back when I was a child  you see I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle Many of you may not like tofu because you havent had good tofu but tofus a good food Its a very simple kind of food Its very hard work to make tofu As a child we used to wake up at  am and work till  pm six days a week My father was kind of like Andy Grove paranoid of the competition So often seven days a week Family business equals child labor We were a great model So I loved going to school School was great and maybe going to school helped me get to this Media Lab place Im not sure Thank you But the Media Lab is an interesting place and its important to me because as a student I was a computer science undergrad and I discovered design later on in my life And there was this person Muriel Cooper Who knows Muriel Cooper Muriel Cooper Wasnt she amazing Muriel Cooper She was wacky And she was a TEDster exactly and she showed us she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again And shes very important in my life because shes the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school It was the best advice I ever got So I went to art school because of her She passed away in  and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes but its so hard This amazing person Muriel Cooper When I was in Japan  I went to an art school in Japan  I had a nice sort of situation because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand Some of you guys know Paul Rand the greatest graphic designer  Im sorry  out there The great graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo the Westinghouse logo He basically said Ive designed everything And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life  the Paul Rand of Japan He designed most of the major icons of Japan like Issey Miyakes brand and also Muji When you have mentors  and yesterday Kareem AbdulJabbar talked about mentors these people in your life  the problem with mentors is that they all die This is a sad thing but its actually a happy thing in a way because you can remember them in their pure form I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us When you get older and youre all freaked out whatever the mentors calm us down And Im grateful for my mentors and Im sure all of you are too Because the human thing is very hard when youre at MIT The T doesnt stand for human it stands for technology And because of that I always wondered about this human thing So Ive always been Googling this word human to find out how many hits I get And in  I had  million hits and for computer because computers are against humans a bit I have  million hits Let me do an Al Gore here So if you sort of compare that like this youll see that computer versus human  Ive been tracking this for the last year  computer versus human over the last year has changed It used to be kind of two to one Now humans are catching up Very good us humans Were catching up with the computers In the simplicity realm its also interesting So if you compare complexities to simplicity its also catching up in a way too So somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined I think I have a confession Im not a man of simplicity I spent my entire early career making complex stuff Lots of complex stuff I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this And Ive always felt bad about it in a sense So I hid in a time dimension I built things in a timegraphics dimension I did this series of calendars for Shiseido This is a floral theme calendar in  and this is a firework calendar So you launch the number into space because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks youre cooler for some reason This is why they have fireworks in the summer A very extreme culture Lastly this is a fallbased calendar because I have so many leaves in my yard So this is the leaves in my yard essentially And so I made a lot of these types of things Ive been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes I feel kind of bad about that Tomorrow Paola Antonelli is speaking I love Paola She has this show right now at MoMA where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA on the walls If youre in New York please go and see that But Ive had a problem because I make all this flying stuff and people say Oh I know your work Youre the guy that makes eye candy And when youre told this you feel kind of weird Eye candy  sort of pejorative dont you think So I say No I make eye meat instead And eye meat is something different something more fibrous something more powerful perhaps But what could that be eye meat Ive been interested in computer programs all my life actually Computer programs are essentially trees and when you make art with a computer program theres kind of a problem Whenever you make art with a computer program youre always on the tree and the paradox is that for excellent art you want to be off the tree So this is sort of a complication Ive found So to get off the tree I began to use my old computers I took these to Tokyo in  to make computer objects This is a new way to type on my old color Classic You cant type very much on this I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions and starts to move by itself so this is a selfdrawing machine And also one year the G Bondi Blue thing  that caddy would come out like dangerous like whack like that But I thought This is very interesting What if I make like a car crash test So I have a crash test And sort of measure the impact Stuff like this are things I made just to sort of understand what these things are Shortly after this  happened and I was very depressed I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss and sort of really sad things and so I wanted to think about something happy So I focused on food as my area  these sort of clementine peel things In Japan its a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece Whos done that before Onepiece clementine Oh you guys are missing out if you havent done it yet It was very good and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this actually in different forms If you dry them quick you can make like elephants and steers and stuff and my wife didnt like these because they mold so I had to stop that So I went back to the computer and I bought five large fries and scanned them all And I was looking for some kind of food theme and I wrote some software to automatically lay out frenchfry images And as a child Id hear that song you know Oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain so I made this amber waves image Its sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries And also as a child I was the fattest kid in class so I used to love Cheetos Oh I love Cheetos yummy So I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way I wasnt sure where to go with this I invented Cheeto paint Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos I discovered that Cheetos are good expressive material And with these Cheetos I began to think What can I make with these Cheetos And so I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks and also pretzels I was looking for some kind of form and in the end I made  butterfries Do you get it And each butterfry is composed of different pieces People ask me how they make the antenna Sometimes they find a hair in the food Thats my hair My hairs clean  its okay Im a tenured professor which means basically I dont have to work anymore Its a strange business model I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte End of story But I realized that life could be very boring so Ive been thinking about life and I notice that my camera  my digital camera versus my car a very strange thing The car is so big the camera is so small yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual It doesnt make any sense So I was in the Cape one time and I typed the word simplicity and I discovered in this weird M Night Shyamalan way that I discovered the letters M I T You know the word In the words simplicity and complexity M I T occur in perfect sequence Its a bit eerie isnt it So I thought maybe Ill do this for the next twenty years or something And I wrote this book The Laws of Simplicity Its a very short simple book There are ten laws and three keys The ten laws and three keys  I wont go over them because thats why I have a book and also thats why its on the Web for free But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way there are all kinds In Japan they say that sushi is challenging You know the uni is the most challenging so number ten is challenging People hate number ten like they hate uni actually The three keys are easy to eat so this is anago cooked already so easy to eat So enjoy your sushi meal later with the laws of simplicity Because I want to simplify them for you Because thats what this is about I have to simplify this thing So if I simplify the laws of simplicity I have whats called the cookie versus laundry thing Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie which cookie are they going to take The big cookie You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it but it doesnt work They want the big cookie But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold the small pile or the big pile which will they choose Strangely not the big pile So I think its as simple as this You know when you want more its because you want to enjoy it When you want less its because its about work And so to boil it all down simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain I think this is sort of simple more versus less Basically it always depends This book I wrote because I want to figure out life I love life I love being alive I like to see things And so life is a big question I think in simplicity because youre trying to simplify your life And I just love to see the world The world is an amazing place By being at TED we see so many things at one time And I cant help but enjoy looking at everything in the world Like everything you see every time you wake up Its such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world From everything from a weird hotel lobby to Saran wrap placed over your window to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun And so this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here because life is finite This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido Hes an expert in aging This horizontal axis is how old you are  twelve years old twentyfour years old seventyfour ninetysix years old  and this is some medical data So brain strength increases up to  and then after  it sort of goes down Kind of depressing in a way Also if you look at your physical strength You know I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT so I tell them Oh your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger but in your late twenties and midthirties cells they die OK It gets them to work harder sometimes And if you have your vision vision is interesting As you age from infant age your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties youre looking for a mate and your vision goes after that Your social responsibility is very interesting So as you get older you may like have kids whatever And then the kids graduate and you have no responsibility any more  thats very good too But if any of you people ask What actually goes up Does anything go up Whats the positive part of this you know I think wisdom always goes up I love these eightyyearold ninetyyearold guys and women They have so many thoughts and they have so much wisdom and I think  you know this TED thing Ive come here And this is the fourth time and I come here for this wisdom I think This whole TED effect it sort of ups your wisdom somehow And Im so glad to be here and Im very grateful to be here Chris And this is an amazing experience for me as well ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

174,As an architect you design for the present with an awareness of the past for a future which is essentially unknown The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day And Id like to share some experience over the last  years  we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year  and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability How far you can anticipate what follows from it what are the threats what are the possibilities the challenges the opportunities I think that  Ive said in the past many many years ago before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda that it wasnt about fashion  it was about survival But what I never said and what Im really going to make the point is that really green is cool I mean all the projects which have in some way been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life I rarely actually quote anything so Im going to try and find a piece of paper if I can in which somebody at the end of last year ventured the thought about what for that individual as a kind of important observer analyst writer  a guy called Thomas Friedman who wrote in the Herald Tribune about  He said I think the most important thing to happen in  was that living and thinking green hit Main Street We reached a tipping point this year where living acting designing investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic capitalistic geopolitical and competitive thing they could do Hence my motto green is the new red white and blue And I asked myself in a way looking back When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear And I think it was July   when for the first time man could look back at planet Earth And in a way it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase And before the kind of collapse of the communist system I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia And interestingly as I think back they were the first true environmentalists They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion fired about the problems of the Aral Sea And at that period it was  in a way a number of things were happening Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru  again a word that had not been coined He was a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresaw all the things that are happening now Its another subject Its another conversation You can go back to his writings its quite extraordinary It was at that time with an awareness fired by Buckys prophecies his concerns as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time And its a number of projects I select this one because it was  and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earths sourcebook and you had the hippie movement And there are some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up the recommendations And all the components are there which are now in common parlance in our vocabulary you know odd years later wind energy recycling biomass solar cells And in parallel at that time there was a very kind of exclusive design club People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun This is going back the mids s And despite Buckys prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style  access to comfort to amenities  it was very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image would be very very stylishly packaged And that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where as the virtual world which brings so many people together here finally connects with the physical world there is the reality that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation of the analog world Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here as we generously had gifted at lunchtime the unclear which is a further kind of development  and again inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel A very very beautiful object So something which in the s s was very exclusive has now become interestingly quite inclusive And the reference to the iPod as iconic and in a way evocative of performance delivery  quite interesting that in the beginning of the year  the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid energyconscious vehicle which rivals the iPod as an iconic product And I think its very tempting to in a way seduce ourselves  as architects or anybody involved with the design process  that the answer to our problems lies with buildings Buildings are important but theyre only a component of a much bigger picture In other words as I might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a carbonfree house for example That would be the answer Unfortunately its not the answer Its only the beginning of the problem You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit For example if in that Buckyinspired phrase we draw back and we look at planet Earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings  percent transport  percent and industry But again that only shows part of the picture If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport in other words the transport of people which is  percent then  percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities of which the buildings are a part For example if you take and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city what Ill call simplistically a North American city  and Detroit is not a bad example it is very car dependent The city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more and more roads and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center  which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example  and Munich is not a bad example of that with the greater dependence on walking and cycling  then a city which is really only twice as dense is only using onetenth of the energy In other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous So basically if you wanted to generalize you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there that the energy consumed reduces dramatically Of course you cant separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance the quality of civic spaces But again you can see Detroit in yellow at the top extraordinary consumption down below Copenhagen And Copenhagen although its a dense city is not dense compared with the really dense cities In the year  a rather interesting thing happened You had for the first time megacities of  million or more which were occurring in the developing world And now out of typically  cities  of those megacities are in the developing world So you have to ask yourself  the environmental impact of for example China or India If you take China and you just take Beijing you can see on that traffic system and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles In other words if you put onto the roads as is currently happening  new cars every day  statistically its the biggest booming auto market in the world  and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing And that urbanization is extraordinary accelerated pace So if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities which took  years then that same process is happening in  years In other words it is accelerating by a factor of  And quite interestingly over something like a year period were seeing the doubling in life expectancy over that period where the urbanization has trebled If I pull back from that global picture and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology  which as a tool is a tool for designers and I cite our own experience as a company and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects  then how do you measure that change of technology How does it affect the design of buildings And particularly how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy create less pollution and are more socially responsible That story in terms of buildings started in the late s early s The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber in a small market town in the northeast of England commuting distance with London And here the first thing you can see is that this building the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also about the celebration of public space In other words for this community they have this garden in the sky So the humanistic ideal is very very strong in all this work encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight you have a connection with nature And nature is part of the generator the driver for this building And symbolically the colors of the interior are green and yellow It has facilities like swimming pools it has flextime it has a social heart a space you have contact with nature Now this was  In  this building received an award And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time And the people whod created it came back the project managers the company chairmen then And they were saying you know The architects Norman was always going on about designing for the future and you know it didnt seem to cost us any more So we humored him we kept him happy The image at the top what it doesnt  if you look at it in detail really what it is saying is you can wire this building This building was wired for change So in  the image there is of typewriters And when the photograph was taken its word processors And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology We were fortunate because in a way our building was futureproofed It anticipated change even though those changes were not known Round about that design period leading up to this building I did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive recently And I was saying and I wrote But we dont have the time and we really dont have the immediate expertise at a technical level In other words we didnt have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building And that would be to create a kind of threedimensional bubble  a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads Notwithstanding the fact that the building as a green building is very much a pioneering building And if I fastforward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory The library of the Free University which opened last year is an example of that And again the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality And a combination of devices here the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin which enables the building to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy and where its really working with the forces of nature And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it Again coming back to that thing about the lifestyle and in a way the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit So its not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse I think its a great  its a celebration And you can measure the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical library If I show another aspect of that technology then in a completely different context  this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials but that material  because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make highperformance components out of timber  very much at the cutting edge And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit to transfer that information now directly into the factory So if you cross the border  just across the border  a small factory in Germany and here you can see the guy with his computer screen and those points in space are communicated And on the left are the cutting machines which then in the factory enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site And then interestingly that building to then be clad in the oldest technology which is the kind of handcut shingles One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish And again the way in which that works as a building for those of us who can enjoy the spaces to live and visit there If I made the leap into these new technologies then how did we  what happened before that I mean you know what was life like before the mobile phone the things that you take for granted Well obviously the building still happened I mean this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of  which opened in  with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here And in the absence of computers you have to physically model So for example we would put models under an artificial sky For wind tunnels we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air and the many kilometers of cable and so on And the turning point was probably in our terms when we had the first computer And that was at the time that we sought to redesign reinvent the airport This is Terminal Four at Heathrow typical of any terminal  big heavy roof blocking out the sunlight lots of machinery big pipes whirring machinery And Stansted the green alternative which uses natural light is a friendly place you know where you are you can relate to the outside And for a large part of its cycle not needing electric light  electric light which in turn creates more heat which creates more cooling loads and so on And at that particular point in time this was one of the few solitary computers And thats a little image of the tree of Stansted Not going back very far in time  thats our office And if you looked very closely youd see that people were drawing with pencils and they were pushing you know big rulers and triangles Its not that long ago  years and here we are now I mean major transformation Going back in time there was a lady called Valerie Larkin and in  she had all our information on one disk Now every week we have the equivalent of  million disks which record our archival information on past current and future projects That reaches  kilometers into the sky This is the view you would get if you looked down on that But meanwhile as you know wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature set in the context of that interestingly those buildings which are celebratory and very very relevant to this place Our Reichstag project which has a very familiar agenda Im sure as a public place where we sought to in a way through a process of advocacy reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians public space And maybe its hidden agenda an energy manifesto  something that would be free completely free of fuel as we know it So it would be totally renewable And again the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a part of the ecology But here not having to model it for real Obviously the wind tunnel had a place but the ability now with the computer to explore to plan to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at biomass A combination of biomass aquifers burning vegetable oil  a process that quite interestingly was developed in Eastern Germany at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc So really retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean it was virtually pollutionfree You can measure it again You can compare how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year  at the time that we took that project over  tons  what it would have been with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil  tons I mean a  percent reduction  virtually clean We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank  its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model those gardens the way they spiral around But again very much about the lifestyle the quality  something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work And again we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption There is an evolution here between the projects and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further  the project in the city in London And this sequence shows the buildup of that model But what it shows first which I think is quite interesting is that here you see the circle you see the public space around it What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site If for example you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement its the same amount of space And finally you profile this you cut grooves into it The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views which give light ventilation make the building fresher And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance which is a mesh of triangulated structures  again in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity And here if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria the way in which now with a computer we can model the forces we can see the high pressure the low pressure the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing So it also has the ability all the time regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to make the building fresh and efficient And unlike conventional buildings the top of the building is celebratory Its a viewing place for people not machinery And the base of the building is again about public space Comparing it with a typical building what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really largescale thinking And Im just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project Its been well known that the Dead Sea is dying The level is dropping rather like the Aral Sea And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline a pipe sometimes above the surface sometimes buried that will redress that and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea And our translation of that using a lot of the thinking built up over the  years is to say what if that instead of being just a pipe what if it is a lifeline What if it is the equivalent depending on where you are of the Grand Canal in terms of tourists habitation desalination agriculture In other words water is the lifeblood And if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility and hostility that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world then its absolutely central to society And how do we make more legible in this growing world especially in some of the places that Im talking about  China for example which in the next ten years will create  new airports Now what form do they take How do you make them more friendly at that scale Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate megabuilding It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment   excuse me  people working  hours seven days Larger by  percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow  built  plus the new unbuilt Terminal Five And the challenge here is a building that will be green that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel is about friendly is coming back to that starting point is very very much about the lifestyle And perhaps these in the end as celebratory spaces As Hubert was talking over lunch as we sort of engaged in conversation talked about this talked about cities Hubert was saying absolutely correctly These are the new cathedrals And in a way one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Years Eve when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations And I was voicing the thought that  it just crossed my mind that New Years Eve a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from  to   that maybe you know the future was the most powerful innovative sort of nation The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say We put a man on the moon You know who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes and so on And thats a concerted platform Its more than one device you know its renewable And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there  the Chinas the Indias the AsianPacific tigers Thank you very much

175,I have a tough job to do You know when I looked at the profile of the audience here with their connotations and design in all its forms and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks and so on that I wanted to tell you I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context In order to do that in  minutes I have to bring out four ideas  its like four pieces of a puzzle And if I succeed in doing that maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on and perhaps help me do my work The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education Now by remoteness I mean two or three different kinds of things Of course remoteness in its normal sense which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center you get to remoter areas What happens to education The second or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world you have pockets like slums or shantytowns or poorer areas which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city so its us and them What happens to education in that context So keep both of those ideas of remoteness We made a guess The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers If they do have they cannot retain those teachers They do not have good enough infrastructure And if they had some infrastructure they have difficulty maintaining it But I wanted to check if this is true So what I did last year was we hired a car looked up on Google found a route into northern India from New Delhi which you know which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers Drove out about  kilometers and wherever we found a school administered a set of standard tests and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph The graph was interesting although you need to consider it carefully I mean this is a very small sample you should not generalize from it But it was quite obvious quite clear that for this particular route that I had taken the remoter the school was the worse its results seemed to be That seemed a little damning and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure or with the availability of electricity and things like that To my surprise it did not correlate It did not correlate with the size of classrooms It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure It did not correlate with the poverty levels It did not correlate But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools with one single question for the teachers  which was Would you like to move to an urban metropolitan area   percent of them said yes And as you can see from that they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi  because you know those are relatively better off areas  and then from  kilometers out of Delhi the answer is consistently yes I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that I wish I was in some other school probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing It appears that way When you take education and technology then I find in the literature that you know things like websites collaborative environments  youve been listening to all that in the morning  its always piloted first in the best schools the best urban schools and according to me biases the result The literature  one part of it the scientific literature  consistently blames ET as being overhyped and underperforming The teachers always say well its fine but its too expensive for what it does Because its being piloted in a school where the students are already getting lets say  percent of whatever they could do You put in this new superduper technology and now they get  percent So the principal looks at it and says  percent for  dollars Forget it If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools where the score was  percent and lets say took that up to  percent  that will be a completely different thing So the relative change that ET Educational Technology would make would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top but we seem to be doing it the other way about So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first not the other way about And finally came the question of how do you tackle teacher perception Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology the teachers first reaction is you cannot replace a teacher with a machine  its impossible I dont know why its impossible but even for a moment if you did assume that its impossible  I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C Clarke the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo and he said something which completely solves this problem He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine should be So you know it puts the teacher into a tough bind you have to think Anyway so Im proposing that an alternative primary education whatever alternative you want is required where schools dont exist where schools are not good enough where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough for whatever reason If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies then you dont need an alternative education So far I havent come across such an area except for one case I wont name the area but somewhere in the world people said we dont have this problem because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools There are such areas but  anyway Id never heard that anywhere else Im going to talk about children and selforganization and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like Theyre called the holeinthewall experiments Ill have to really rush through this Theyre a set of experiments The first one was done in New Delhi in  And what we did over there was pretty much simple I had an office in those days which bordered a slum an urban slum so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum They cut a hole inside that wall  which is how it has got the name holeinthewall  and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall put it on highspeed Internet put the Internet Explorer there put it on Altavistacom  in those days  and just left it there And this is what we saw So that was my office in IIT Heres the holeinthewall About eight hours later we found this kid To the right is this eightyearold child who  and to his left is a sixyearold girl who is not very tall And what he was doing was he was teaching her to browse So it sort of raised more questions than it answered Is this real Does the language matter because hes not supposed to know English Will the computer last or will they break it and steal it  and did anyone teach them The last question is what everybody said but you know I mean they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office can you show me how to do it and then somebody taught him So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything So it was a warm day and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building This is the first kid who came there he later on turned out to be a yearold school dropout He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad Very quickly he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen  and later on he told me I have never seen a television where you can do something So he figured that out It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television And then as he was doing that he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad  youll see him do that He did that and the Internet Explorer changed page Eight minutes later he looked from his hand to the screen and he was browsing he was going back and forth When that happened he started calling all the neighborhood children like children would come and see whats happening over here And by the evening of that day  children were all browsing So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there So we thought that this is what was happening that children in groups can selfinstruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet But under what circumstances At this time there was a  the main question was about English People said you know you really ought to have this in Indian languages So I said have what shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language Thats not possible So it has to be the other way about But lets see how do the children tackle the English language I took the experiment out to northeastern India to a village called Madantusi where for some reason there was no English teacher so the children had not learned English at all And I built a similar holeinthewall One big difference in the villages as opposed to the urban slums there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk In the urban slums the girls tend to stay away I left the computer there with lots of CDs  I didnt have any Internet  and came back three months later So when I came back there I found these two kids eight and yearolds who were playing a game on the computer And as soon as they saw me they said We need a faster processor and a better mouse I was real surprised You know how on earth did they know all this And they said Well weve picked it up from the CDs So I said But how did you understand whats going on over there So they said Well youve left this machine which talks only in English so we had to learn English So then I measured and they were using  English words with each other  mispronounced but correct usage  words like exit stop find save that kind of thing not only to do with the computer but in their daytoday conversations So Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to Finally I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable if they happen everywhere else India is a good place to do such an experiment in because we have all the ethnic diversities all the  you know the genetic diversity all the racial diversities and also all the socioeconomic diversities So I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world So I did this for almost five years and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India This is the Himalayas Up in the north very cold I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors and I was using regular normal PCs so I needed different climates for which India is also great because we have very cold very hot and so on This is the desert to the west Near the Pakistan border And you see here a little clip of  one of these villages  the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet Then to central India  very warm moist fishing villages where humidity is a very big killer of electronics So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running I want to just cut this short We did this over and over again This sequence is also nice This is a small child a sixyearold telling his eldest sister what to do And this happens very often with these computers that the younger children are found teaching the older ones What did we find We found that six to yearolds can selfinstruct in a connected environment irrespective of anything that we could measure So if they have access to the computer they will teach themselves including intelligence I couldnt find a single correlation with anything but it had to be in groups And that may be of great you know interest to this group because all of you are talking about groups So here was the power of what a group of children can do if you lift the adult intervention Just a quick idea of the measurements We took standard statistical techniques so Im going to not talk about that But we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school Ill leave it at that because I mean it sort of says it all doesnt it What could they learn to do Basic Windows functions browsing painting chatting and email games and educational material music downloads playing video In short what all of us do And over  children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer So how do they do that If you calculated the actual time of access it would work out to minutes per day so thats not how its happening What you have actually is there is one child operating the computer And surrounding him are usually three other children who are advising him on what they should do If you test them all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them Around these four are usually a group of about  children who are also advising usually wrongly about everything thats going on on the computer And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing It seems counterintuitive to adult learning but remember eightyearolds live in a society where most of the time they are told dont do this you know dont touch the whiskey bottle So what does the eightyearold do He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched And if you tested him he would answer every question correctly on that topic So they seem to be able to acquire very quickly So what was the conclusion over the six years of work It was that primary education can happen on its own or parts of it can happen on its own It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards It could perhaps be a selforganizing system so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you that children can selforganize and attain an educational objective The third piece was on values and again to put it very briefly I conducted a test over  children spread across all over India and asked them  I gave them about  different valuesoriented questions and simply asked them their opinions We got all sorts of opinions Yes no or I dont know I simply took those questions where I got  percent yeses and  percent noes  so I was able to get a collection of  such statements These were areas where the children were clearly confused because half said yes and half said no A typical example being Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies They dont have a way to determine which way to answer this question perhaps none of us do So I leave you with this third question Can technology alter the acquisition of values Finally selforganizing systems about which again I wont say too much because youve been hearing all about it Natural systems are all selforganizing galaxies molecules cells organisms societies  except for the debate about an intelligent designer But at this point in time as far as science goes its selforganization But other examples are traffic jams stock market society and disaster recovery terrorism and insurgency And you know about the Internetbased selforganizing systems So here are my four sentences then Remoteness affects the quality of education Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first and other areas later Values are acquired doctrine and dogma are imposed  the two opposing mechanisms And learning is most likely a selforganizing system If you put all the four together then it gives  according to me  it gives us a goal a vision for educational technology An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital automatic faulttolerant minimally invasive connected and selforganized As educationists we have never asked for technology we keep borrowing it PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology but it was not meant for education it was meant for making boardroom presentations We borrowed it Video conferencing The personal computer itself I think its time that the educationists made their own specs and I have such a set of specs This is a brief look at that And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness values and violence So I thought Id give it a name  why dont we call it outdoctrination And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future So I want to leave that as a thought with you Thank you

176,I am known best for humanpowered flight but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that Im working in now As a youngster I was very interested in model airplanes ornithopters autogyros helicopters gliders power planes indoor models outdoor models everything which I just thought was a lot of fun and wondered why most other people didnt share my same enthusiasm with them And then navy pilot training and after college I got into sailplane flying power plane flying and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun but got tangled up with some great professor types who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science While this was all going on I was in the field of weather modification although getting a PhD in aeronautics The weather modification subject was getting started and as a graduate student I could go around to the various talks that were being given on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast and so on And everybody would talk to me but all the professionals in the field hated each other and they wouldnt communicate And as a result I got the absolutely unique background in that field and started a company which did more research in weather modification than anybody and there are a lot of things that I just cant go into But then  started AeroVironment with no employees  then one or two three and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects We had AirDynamisis who like I did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big many year project and so we did our small projects and the company slowly grew The thing that is exciting was in  I suddenly got interested in the humanpowered airplane because Id made a made a loan to a friend of  dollars or I guaranteed the money at the bank He needed them  he needed the money for starting a company The company did not succeed and he couldnt pay the money back and I was the guarantor of the note So I had a  debt and I noticed that the Kramer prize for humanpowered flight which had then been around for  Laughter   years at the time was  pounds which at the exchange rate was just about  dollars So suddenly I was interested in humanpowered flight  Laughter  and did not  the way I approached it first thinking about ways to make the planes was just like theyd been doing in England and not succeeding and I gave it up I figured nah there isnt any simple easy way But then got off on a vacation trip and was studying bird flight just for the fun of it and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles and measure the time and estimate the bank angle and immediately figure out its speed and the turning radius and so on which I could do in the car as were driving along on a vacation trip  Laughter  with my three sons young sons helping me but ridiculing the whole thing very much But that began thinking about how birds went around and then how airplanes would how hang gliders would fly and then other planes and the idea of the GossamerCondortype airplane quickly emerged was so logical one should have thought of it in the first place but one didnt And it was just keep the weight down   pounds was all it weighed  but let the size swell up like a hang glider but three times the span three times the cord Youre down to a third of the speed a third of the power and a good bicyclist can put out that power and that worked and we won the prize a year later We didnt  a lot of flying a lot of experiments a lot of things that didnt work and ones that did work and the plane kept getting a little better a little better Got a good pilot Brian Allen to operate it and finally succeeded But unfortunately about  dollars was spent on the project And there was only about  to help retire the debt But fortunately Henry Kramer who put up the prize for  that was a onemile flight  put up a new prize for flying the English Channel  miles And he thought it would take another  years for somebody to win that We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit the power to fly would be decreased a little bit and if you decrease the power required a little the pilot can fly a much longer period of time And Brian Allen was able in a miraculous flight to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel and we won the pound dollar prize for that And when all expenses were paid the debt was handled and everything was fine It turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt so for five years six years I only had to pay one third income tax So there were good economic reasons for the project but  Laughter  thats not well the project was done entirely for economic reasons and we have not been involved in any humanpowered flight since then  Laughter  because the prizes are all over But that sure started me thinking about various things and immediately we began making a solarpowered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world we didnt want the small funding in the government to be decreased which is what the government was trying to do with it And we thought a solarpowered plane wouldnt really make sense but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field And that project continued did succeed and we then got into other projects in aviation and mechanical things and ground devices But while this was going on in  I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation  their annual prize  and I had to prepare a paper on it which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I really was after and what was important And to my surprise I realized the importance of environmental issues which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to and preparing that paper did me a lot of good I thought back about if I was a space traveler and came and visited Earth every  years And for a few thousand visits I would see the same thing every time the little differences in the Earth But this last time just coming round right now suddenly thered be huge changes in the environment in the concentration of people and it was just unbelievable the amount of  all the change in it I wanted to  well one of the biggest changes is  years ago we began using coal from underground which has a lot of pollution and  years ago began getting gasoline from underground with a lot of pollution And gasoline consumption or production will reach its limit in about ten years and then go down and we wonder whats going to happen with transportation I wanted to show the slide  this slide I think is the most important one any of you will see ever because  Applause  it shows nature versus humans and goes from  to  And so the year  you see there And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on are  the red line goes up Thats the humans and livestock and pets portion The green line goes down Thats the wild nature portion Humans livestock and pets are now  percent of the total worlds mass of vertebrates on land and air And you dont know what the future will hold but its not going to get a lower percentage Ten thousand years ago the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldnt even have been visible on such a curve Now they are  percent and it I think shows human domination of the Earth I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer and ask them after theyve asked me questions and I give them a talk and so on Then I ask them questions Whats the population of the Earth Whats the population of the Earth going to be when youre the age of your parents Which Id never really  they had never really thought about but now they think about it And then what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium that could continue on and be for    And they form little groups all fighting with each other and when I leave two hours later most of them are saying about  billion people and they dont have any clue about how to get down to  billion nor do I but I think theyre right and this is a serious problem Rachel Carson was thinking of these and came out with Silent Spring way back Solar Manifesto by Hermann Scheer in Germany claims all energy on Earth can be derived for every country from solar energy and water and so on You dont need to dig down for these chemicals and we can do things much more efficiently Lets have the next slide So this just summarizes it Over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin covering of life  complex and probable wonderful and fragile Suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power We now wield the paintbrush Were in charge Its frightening And I do a painting every  or  years This is the last one And it shows the Earth in a time flag on the right in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on and over the triangle we now get to civilization and TV and traffic jams and so on I have no idea of what comes next so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future as a little warning And two weeks after this drawing was done we actually had our first project contract at AeroVironment on robotic cockroaches which was very frightening to me Paper rustling Well thatll be all the slides As time went on we stopped our environmental programs We focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future and we produced products for the company And we developed the impact car that General Motors made the EV out of  and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars but theyve since come apart And weve done a lot of things small drone airplanes and so on I have a Helios We have the first video Video Narrator With a wingspan of  feet this makes her larger than a Boeing  Music Her designers attention to detail and her construction gives Helios structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere This enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if shes sliding along on the ocean waves Paul MacCready The wings could touch together on top and not break We think Narrator And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun to maximize the power from her solar array Music As the sky gets darker and the outside air temperatures drop below minus  degrees Fahrenheit the most environmentally hostile segment of Helioss journey has gone by without notice except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors Approaching a peak radar altitude of  feet at  pm Helios is standing on top of  percent of the Earths atmosphere This is more than  feet higher than the previous worlds altitude record held by the SR Blackbird PM That plane has many purposes but its aimed for communications and it can fly so slowly that itll just stay up at  feet Eventually it will be able to have to stay up day night day night for six months at a time acting like the synchronous satellite but only ten miles above the Earth Lets have the next video This shows the other end of the spectrum Video Narrator A tiny airplane the AV Pointer serves for surveillance In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses a cuttingedge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle It is convenient to carry assemble and launch by hand Batterypowered it is silent and rarely noticed It sends highresolution video pictures back to the operator With onboard GPS it can navigate autonomously and it is rugged enough to selfland without damage PM Okay and lets have the next That plane is widely used by the military now in all their operations Lets have the next video Video Music Alan Alda Hes got it hes got it hes got it on his head Music Were going to end our visit with Paul MacCreadys flying circus by meeting his son Tyler who with his two brothers helped build the Gossamer Condor  years ago Tyler MacCready You can chase it like this for hours AA When they got bored with their fathers project they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own TM And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing or on the other AA They called it their Walkalong Glider Music Ive never seen anything like that How old were you when you invented that TM Oh   AA Oh my God TM  something like that AA Thats amazing PM And Tylers here to show you the Walkalong TM All right You all got a couple of these in your gift bags and one of the first things the production version seemed to dive a little bit and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it Ill give you a demonstration of how it works The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body like a seagull soaring on a cliff As the wind comes up it has to go over the cliff so as you walk through the air it goes around your body some has to go over you And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current The launch is the difficult part youve got to hold it high up over your head and you start walking forward and just let go of it and you can control it like that And then also like it said in the video you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another So I can do it  oops that was going to be a right turn Okay this one will be a left turn Here but  Applause  anyway And thats it so you can just control it wherever you want and its just hours of fun And these are no longer in production so you have real collectors items And this we just wanted to show you  if we can get the video running on this yeah  just an example of a little video surveillance This was flying around in the party last night and  Laughter  you can see how it just can fly around and you can spy on anybody you want And thats it I was going to bring an airplane but I was worried about hitting people in here so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle And thats it yeah just a few inventions All right ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

177,Im going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it the problems and the opportunities that we face and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic And then Ill let you in on a secret which is why I am an incurable optimist Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before Now youve all seen Inconvenient Truth This is a little more inconvenient Video Man  extremely dangerous questions Because with our present knowledge we have no idea what would happen Even now man may be unwittingly changing the worlds climate through the waste products of his civilization Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide  which helps air absorb heat from the sun  our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer This is bad Well its been calculated a few degrees rise in the earths temperature would melt the polar ice caps And if this happens an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley Tourists in glassbottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through  feet of tropical water For in weather were not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters but with life itself Larry Brilliant Should we feel good or should we feel bad that  years of foreknowledge accomplished so little Well it depends really on what your goals are And I think as my goals I always go back to Gandhis talisman When Mahatma Gandhi was asked How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one he said Consider the face of the poorest most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person And if it will be its the right thing to do and if not rethink it For those of us in this room its not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual its the community its the culture its the world itself And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society who are the poorest and the most vulnerable the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism But theres also a wonderful case for optimism Lets review them both First of all the megatrends Theres two degrees or three degrees of climate change baked into the system It will cause rising seas It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable as will the increasing rise of population Even though weve dodged Paul Ehrlichs population bomb and we will not see  billion people in this decade as he had forecast we eat as if we were  billion And we consume so much that again a rise of  billion to  billion in our grandchildrens lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable Thats why they migrate to cities Thats why in June of this year we passed as a species  percent of us living in cities and bustees and slums and shantytowns The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did The green revolution never reached Africa And with desertification sandstorms the Gobi Desert the Ogaden we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare to produce as many calories as it did even  years ago So humans are turning more towards animal consumption In Africa last year Africans ate  million wild animals and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted the genomic sequences of which we dont know Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of but we are ripe for zoonoticborne emerging communicable diseases Increasingly I would say explosive growth of technology Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth But it has a dark side  in bioweapons and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger hatred or feeling of marginalization And in fact with increasing globalization  for which there are big winners and even bigger losers  today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history One percent of us own  percent of all the goods and services What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next  years The one percent will own even more than  percent of all the worlds goods and services Not because theyve grown richer but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer Last week Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said This situation is unprecedented unequal unfair and unstable So theres lots of reason for pessimism Darfur is at its origin a resource war Last year there were  riots in China  a day that required police or military intervention Most of them were about resources We are facing an unprecedented number scale of disasters Some are weatherrelated humanrights related epidemics And the newly emerging diseases may make HN and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come Its a destabilized world And unlike destabilized world in the past it will be broadcast to you on YouTube you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones What will that lead to For some it will lead to anger religious and sectarian violence and terrorism For others withdrawal nihilism materialism For us where does it take us as social activists and entrepreneurs As we look at these trends do we become despondent or will we become energized Lets look at one case the case of Bangladesh First even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today global warming would continue And even with global warming  if you can see these blue lines the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today the next decades will see rising sea levels A minimum of  to  inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for and it could be  times that What will that do to Bangladesh Lets take a look So heres Bangladesh  percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level Lets go up and take a look at the Himalayas And well watch as global warming makes them melt More water comes down the deforested areas here in the Tarai will be unable to absorb the effluent because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water Now were looking down south through the Kali Gandaki Many of you I think have probably trekked here And were going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north and in the seas rising from the south Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh And now lets look from the south looking up and lets see this in relief A minimum of  to  inches of increase in seas coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas And take a look at this As many as  million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate into India and into China This is the difficulty that one country faces But if you look at the globe all around the earth wherever there is lowlying area populated areas near the water you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life SubSaharan Africa and even our own San Francisco Bay Area Were all in this together This is not something that happens far away to people that we dont know Global warming is something that happens to all of us all at once As are these newly emerging communicable diseases names that you hadnt heard  years ago ebola lhasa fever monkey pox With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans we live in each others viral environment Do you remember  years ago no one had ever heard of West Nile fever And then we watched as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year westwardly Do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it Its just the beginning unfortunately There have been  novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last  years Its more than enough reason for pessimism But now lets look at the case for optimism Laughter Enough of the bad news Human beings have always risen to the challenge You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves Weve been here before paralyzed by fear paralyzed into inaction when some  probably one of you in this room  jumped into the breach and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility which fought against the nuclear threat Medicins Sans Frontieres that renewed our commitment to disaster relief Mohamed ElBaradei and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us and our own Muhammad Yunus Weve seen the eradication of smallpox We may see the eradication of polio this year Last year there were only  cases in the world We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year  there are only  cases left in the world  years ago there were three and a half million And weve seen a new disease not like the  novel emerging communicable diseases This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome Laughter Its an amazing phenomenon All throughout the technology world were seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome But theyre using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did Theyre not waiting until they die to create foundations Theyre actively guiding their money their resources their hearts their commitments to make the world a better place Certainly nothing can give you more optimism than that More reasons to be optimistic in the s and I am a creature of the s there was a movement We all felt that we were part of it that a better world was right around the corner that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice Today theres another kind of movement Its a movement to save the earth Its just beginning Five weeks ago a group of activists from the business community gathered together to stop a Texas utility from building nine coalfired electrical plants that would have contributed to destroying the environment Six months ago a group of business activists gathered together to join with the Republican governor in California to pass AB  the most farreaching legislation in environmental history Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness Can you imagine Laughter Were seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago I would not have believed as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming And now  churches have joined the environmental movement It is something to be greatly optimistic about The European  plan is an amazing breakthrough something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon And on April th there will be Step Up Day where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest against legislation  pushing for legislation to stop global warming And on July th around the world I learned only yesterday there will be global Live Earth concerts And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air Now that doesnt mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most That means that people are beginning the first step which is acting out of their own selfinterest But I am seeing in the major funders in CARE Rockefeller Rockefeller Brothers Fund Hewlett Mercy Corps you guys Google so many other organizations a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable But for me I have another reason to be an incurable optimist And youve heard so many inspiring stories here and I heard so many last night that I thought I would share a little bit of mine My background is not exactly conventional medical training And I lived in a Himalayan monastery and I studied with a very wise teacher who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny  it felt like Yoda  it is your destiny to go to work for WHO and to help eradicate smallpox at a time when there was no smallpox program It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history In the last century  thats the one that was seven years ago  half a billion people died from smallpox more than all the wars in history more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world In the Summer of Love in  two million people children died of smallpox Its not ancient history When you read the biblical plague of boils that was smallpox Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth whose picture is here died of smallpox To eradicate smallpox we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history We visited every house in India searching for smallpox   million houses once every month for nearly two years In a cruel reversal after we had almost conquered smallpox  and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur the realm of the final inch When we had almost eradicated smallpox it came back again because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers who could come there and get employment And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox and they went home to die And when they did they took smallpox to  other countries and reignited the epidemic And we had to start all over again But in the end we succeeded and the last case of smallpox this little girl Rahima Banu  Barisal in Bangladesh  when she coughed or breathed and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus thus ended a chain of transmission of historys greatest horror How can that not make you optimistic A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in India ended And most importantly for us here in this room a bond was created Doctors health workers from  different countries of every race every religion every color worked together fought alongside each other fought against a common enemy didnt fight against each other How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

178,"In the next  minutes Im going to take you on a journey And its a journey that you and I have been on for many years now and it began some  years ago when humans first stepped off our planet And in those  years not only did we literally physically set foot on the moon but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets  all eight of them  and we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto the body formerly known as a planet And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey a voyage to understand something to get a sense of our cosmic place to understand something of our origins and how Earth our planet and we living on it came to be And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this theres Saturn And we have been to Saturn before  we visited Saturn in the early s  but our investigations of Saturn have become far more indepth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of  and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun Now the Saturn system is a rich planetary system It offers mystery scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach In fact just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies And heres a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula which is our closest largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way And then heres a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy taken by the Hubble Space Telescope So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us and also how humans fit into that picture And it pains me that I cant tell you all that we have learned with Cassini I cant show you all the beautiful pictures that weve taken in the last two and a half years because I simply dont have the time So Im going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn and have been for the past two and a half years Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the US Most of the beautiful pictures weve taken of Saturn in fact show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons Heres Saturn with Dione and then heres Saturn showing the rings edgeon showing you just how vertically thin they are with the moon Enceladus Now two of the  moons that Saturn has are standouts And those are Titan and Enceladus Titan is Saturns largest moon and until Cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system And it is a body that has long intrigued people whove watched the planets It has a very large thick atmosphere and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles This haze is ubiquitous Its completely global and enveloping Titan And thats why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum But these haze particles it was surmised before we got there with Cassini over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge So like the equivalent the Titan equivalent of tar or oil or what  we didnt know what But this is what we suspected And these molecules especially methane and ethane can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth Its a condensable in the atmosphere and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities You can have methane clouds OK and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface The temperature at the surface is some  degrees below zero Fahrenheit But despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth it carves gullies it forms rivers and cataracts it can create canyons it can pool in large basins and craters It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands So stop and think for a minute Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like Its dark High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth Its cold its eerie its misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner Laughter That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini 
 and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is And for us it has been like  the Cassini people  it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true As I said it has a thick extensive atmosphere This is a picture of Titan backlit by the Sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop And yet another moon there  I dont even know which one it is Its a very extensive atmosphere We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere and my camera system is one of them And we have taken pictures like this And what you see is bright and dark regions and thats about as far as it got for us It was so mystifying we couldnt make out what we were seeing on Titan When you look closer at this region you start to see things like sinuous channels  we didnt know You see a few round things This we later found out is in fact a crater but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan meaning its a very young surface And there are features that look tectonic They look like theyve been pulled apart Whenever you see anything linear on a planet it means theres been a fracture like a fault And so its been tectonically altered But we couldnt make sense of our images until six months after we got into orbit an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassinis investigation of Titan And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe the Europeanbuilt Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan it took two and a half hours to descend and it landed on the surface And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is This is a device of human making and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history It is so significant that in my mind this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the US and Europe and sadly that wasnt the case Laughter It was significant for another reason This is an international mission and this event was celebrated in Europe in Germany and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents and American accents and German accents and French and Italian and Dutch accents It was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations are supposed to mean a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good And in this case it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it So it was  I mean Im getting goose bumps just talking about it It was a tremendously emotional event and its something that I will personally never forget and you shouldnt either Applause But anyway the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures And I cant tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titans surface from the probe And this is what we saw And it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be It was an unambiguous pattern a geological pattern Its a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge And they converge into this channel here which drains into this region You are looking at a shoreline Was this a shoreline of fluids We didnt know But this is somewhat of a shoreline This picture is taken at  kilometers This is the picture taken at eight kilometers OK Again the shoreline Okay now  kilometers eight kilometers  this is roughly an airline altitude If you were going to take an airplane trip across the US you would be flying at these altitudes So this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan Laughter And then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and Im going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system And here is the horizon OK These are probably water ice pebbles yes Applause And obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didnt sink out of sight So it wasnt fluid that we landed in What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane And its probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in lowlying basins And that is what the Huygens probe landed in But still there was no sign in our images or even in the Huygens images of any large open bodies of fluids Where were they It got even more puzzling when we found dunes OK so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan showing these dunes These are dunes that are  meters tall separated by a few kilometers and they go on for miles and miles and miles Theres hundreds up to a  or  miles of dunes This is the Saharan desert of Titan Its obviously a place which is very dry or you wouldnt get dunes So again it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid until finally we saw lakes in the polar regions And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan Its about the size of Lake Ontario And then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of Titan and found again we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea So it seems that the liquids for some reason we dont understand or during at least this season are apparently at the poles of Titan And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable mystical place Its exotic its alien but yet strangely Earthlike and having Earthlike geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself And so now we go onto Enceladus Enceladus is a small moon its about a tenth the size of Titan And you can see it here next to England just to show you the size This is not meant to be a threat Laughter And Enceladus is very white its very bright and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures It is a very geologically active body But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole  and were looking at the south pole here  where we found this system of fractures And theyre a different color because theyre a different composition They are coated These fractures are coated with organic materials Moreover this whole entire region the south polar region has elevated temperatures Its the hottest place on the planet on the body Thats as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics And then when we took additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space And when we colorcode this image to bring out the faint light levels we see that these jets feed a plume that in fact we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus My team and I have examined images like this and like this one and have thought about the other results from Cassini And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus So we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat In other words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms And I dont think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific implications Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once but twice independently in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its  billion year history Right now Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life It is precious it is unique it is still so far the only home weve ever known And if any of you were alert and coherent during the s  and wed forgive you if you werent OK  you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo  astronauts in  It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet Well we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first a picture that no human eye has ever seen before It is a total eclipse of the Sun seen from the other side of Saturn And in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main rings backlit by the Sun you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created in fact by the exhalations of Enceladus But as if that werent brilliant enough we can spot in this beautiful image sight of our own planet cradled in the arms of Saturns rings Now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blueocean planet in the skies of other worlds And that and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that may be in the end the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago And thank you very much

181,Chris Anderson Welcome to TED Richard Branson Thank you very much The first TED has been great CA Have you met anyone interesting RB Well the nice thing about TED is everybodys interesting I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn because I had an apology to make to her Id had dinner with her about two years ago and Id  she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldnt get it off And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another womans big massive big wedding ring on my finger And anyway the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off So  Laughter  so apologies to Goldie CA Thats pretty good So were going to put up some slides of some of your companies here Youve started one or two in your time So you know Virgin Atlantic Virgin Records  I guess it all started with a magazine called Student And then yes all these other ones as well I mean how do you do this RB I read all these sort of TED instructions you must not talk about your own business and this and now you ask me So I suppose youre not going to be able to kick me off the stage since you asked the question CA It depends what the answer is though RB No I mean I think I learned early on that if you can run one company you can really run any companies I mean companies are all about finding the right people inspiring those people you know drawing out the best in people And I just love learning and Im incredibly inquisitive and I love taking on you know the status quo and trying to turn it upside down So Ive seen life as one long learning process And if I see  you know if I fly on somebody elses airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one which it wasnt  years ago then Id think well you know maybe I can create the kind of airline that Id like to fly on And so you know so got one secondhand  from Boeing and gave it a go CA Well that was a bizarre thing because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy And in fact in a way it almost took down your empire at one point I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic and his view was that you were trading you know the worlds fourth biggest record company for the twentyfifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind Why did you do that RB Well I think that theres a very thin dividing line between success and failure And I think if you start a business without financial backing youre likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line We had  we were being attacked by British Airways They were trying to put our airline out of business and they launched whats become known as the dirty tricks campaign And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless I chipped in a chip And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline CA PostNapster youre looking like a bit of a genius actually for that as well RB Yeah as it turned out it proved to be the right move But yeah it was sad at the time but we moved on CA Now you use the Virgin brand a lot and it seems like youre getting synergy from one thing to the other What does the brand stand for in your head RB Well I like to think it stands for quality that you know if somebody comes across a Virgin company they  CA They are quality Richard Come on now everyone says quality Spirit RB No but I was going to move on this We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it As I say we go in and shake up other industries and I think you know we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market CA I mean there are a few launches youve done where the brand maybe hasnt worked quite as well I mean Virgin Brides  what happened there RB We couldnt find any customers CA I was actually also curious why  I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch You called it Mates I mean couldnt you have used the Virgin brand for that as well Aint virgin no longer or something RB Again we may have had problems finding customers I mean we had  often when you launch a company and you get customer complaints you know you can deal with them But about three months after the launch of the condom company I had a letter a complaint and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely But obviously there wasnt a lot I could do about it And then six months later or nine months after the problem had taken I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if Id be godfather which I became So it all worked out well CA Really You should have brought a picture Thats wonderful RB I should have CA So just help us with some of the numbers I mean what are the numbers on this I mean how big is the group overall How much  whats the total revenue RB Its about  billion dollars now in total CA And how many employees RB About  CA So youve been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that What was that Was that real RB Yeah We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles I think No I mean I think  CA But is that your hair RB No CA What was that one RB Dropping in for tea CA OK RB Ah that was quite fun That was a wonderful carboat in which  CA Oh that car that we  actually we  it was a TEDster event there I think Is that  could you still pause on that one actually for a minute RB Its a tough job isnt it CA I mean it is a tough job When I first came to America I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of  they have these different rules over here its very strange RB I know I have  the lawyers say you mustnt do things like that but  CA I mean speaking of which tell us about  RB Pammy we launched you know  mistakenly thought we could take on CocaCola and we launched a cola bottle called The Pammy and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson But the trouble is it kept on tipping over but  CA Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps RB Of course CA So well just run a couple more pictures here Virgin Brides Very nice And OK so stop there This was  you had some award I think RB Yeah well  years earlier wed launched the Sex Pistols God Save The Queen and Id certainly never expected that  years later  that shed actually knight us But somehow she must have had a forgetful memory I think CA Well God saved her and you got your just reward Do you like to be called Sir Richard or how RB Nobodys ever called me Sir Richard Occasionally in America I hear people saying Sir Richard and think theres some Shakespearean play taking place But nowhere else anyway CA OK So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just  RB No I suppose if youre having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something that might be worth using it CA You know its not Richard Branson Its Sir Richard Branson RB Ill go get the secretary to use it CA OK So lets look at the space thing I think with us weve got a video that shows what youre up to and Virgin Galactic up in the air Video So thats the Bert Rutan designed spaceship RB Yeah itll be ready in  well ready in  months and then we do  months extensive testing And then  months from now people will be able to take a ride into space CA So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed RB Philippe has done the  yeah quite a bit of it the logos and hes building the space station in New Mexico And basically hes just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye so when youre in space you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you And when you land youll be able to go back into this giant eye But hes an absolute genius when it comes to design CA But you didnt have him design the engine RB Philippe is quite erratic so I think that he wouldnt be the best person to design the engine no CA He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago RB Yeah No he is a  CA Well some people found it wonderful some people found it completely bizarre But I personally found it wonderful RB Hes a wonderful enthusiast which is why I love him But  CA So now youve always had this exploration bug in you Have you ever regretted that RB Many times I mean I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions weve done in the past Well I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters so  and each time I didnt expect to come home to tell the tale So in those moments you certainly wonder what youre doing up there or  CA What was the closest you got to  when did you think this is it I might be on my way out RB Well I think the balloon adventures were  each one was each one actually I think we came close And I mean first of all we  nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream and we werent quite sure when a balloon actually got into the jet stream whether it would actually survive the   miles an hour winds that you can find up there And so just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic as we were pushing into the jet stream this enormous balloon  the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour and it just took off And it was like holding onto a thousand horses And we were just crossing every finger praying that the balloon would hold together which fortunately it did But the ends of all those balloon trips were you know  something seemed to go wrong every time and on that particular occasion the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped and left me holding on for dear life CA Did he tell you to jump or he just said Im out of here and  RB No he told me jump but once his weight had gone the balloon just shot up to  feet and I  CA And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that RB Yeah No I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute looking at the swirling clouds below trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea which  and it was a very very very lonely few moments But anyway we managed to survive it CA Did you jump Or it came down in the end RB Well I knew I had about half an hours fuel left and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped I would only have a couple of minutes of life left So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that I was making the right decision And wrote some notes to my family And then climbed back up again looked down at those clouds again climbed back into the capsule again And then finally just thought theres a better way Ive got you know this enormous balloon above me its the biggest parachute ever why not use it And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds and about  feet before I hit the sea threw myself over And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to  feet without me But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and  CA What did you write to your family RB Just what you would do in a situation like that just I love you very much And Id already written them a letter before going on this trip which  just in case anything had happened But fortunately they never had to use it CA Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics The years  and until I stopped looking at the polls you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the UK and elsewhere And cynics might say you know this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing How much was the PR value part of this RB Well of course the PR experts said that as an airline owner the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats and crashing into the seas CA They have a point Richard RB In fact I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying you know come on Richard there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic CA To do all this you must have been a genius from the getgo right RB Well I wont contradict that CA OK this isnt exactly hardball OK Didnt  werent you just terrible at school RB I was dyslexic I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever I certainly would have failed IQ tests And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was  years old And if I  if Im not interested in something I dont grasp it As somebody whos dyslexic you also have some quite bizarre situations I mean for instance Ive had to  you know Ive been running the largest group of private companies in Europe but havent been able to know the difference between net and gross And so the board meetings have been fascinating And so its like good news or bad news And generally the people would say oh well thats bad news CA But just to clarify the  billion dollars is gross right Thats gross RB Well I hope its net actually having  Laughter  Ive got it right CA No trust me its gross RB So when I turned  somebody took me outside the boardroom and said Look Richard heres a  let me draw on a diagram Heres a net in the sea and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net And thats the profits youve got left over in this little net everything else is eaten And I finally worked it all out CA But I mean at school  so as well as being you know doing pretty miserably academically but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams So you were kind of a  you were a natural leader but just a bit of a  Were you a rebel then or how would you  RB Yeah I think I was a bit of a maverick and  but I  And I was yeah I was fortunately good at sport and so at least I had something to excel at at school CA And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life I mean theres the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field aged four and saying OK walk home Did this really happen RB She was you know she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age So she did things to us which now shed be arrested for such as pushing us out of the car and telling us to find our own way to Grannys about five miles before we actually got there And making us go on wonderful long bike rides And we were never allowed to watch television and the like CA But is there a risk here I mean theres a lot of people in the room who are wealthy and theyve got kids and weve got this dilemma about how you bring them up Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think theyre too coddled they dont know what theyve got were going to raise a generation of privileged  RB No I think if youre bringing up kids you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm So I dont think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really CA You didnt turn out too bad I have to say Im  Your headmaster said to you  I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school  he said youre either going to be a millionaire or go to prison and Im not sure which Which of those happened first RB Well Ive done both I think I went to prison first I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the UK I was prosecuted under the  Venereal Diseases Act and the  Indecent Advertisements Act On the first occasion for mentioning the word venereal disease in public which  we had a center where we would help young people who had problems And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease And theres an ancient law that says you cant actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public So the police knocked on the door and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots but nobody came with VD any more So we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested And then subsequently Never Mind the Bollocks Heres the Sex Pistols the word bollocks the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols album And John Mortimer the playwright defended us And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks And so I rang up Nottingham University and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics And he said Look bollocks is not a  has nothing to do with balls whatsoever Its actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century And he went Furthermore Im a priest myself And so I said Would you mind coming to the court And he said hed be delighted And I said  and he said Would you like me to wear my dog collar And I said Yes definitely Please CA Thats great RB So our key witness argued that it was actually Never Mind the Priest Heres the Sex Pistols And the judge found us  reluctantly found us not guilty so  CA That is outrageous So seriously is there a dark side A lot of people would say theres no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back you know doing some ugly things Youve been accused of being ruthless There was a nasty biography written about you by someone Is any of it true Is there an element of truth in it RB I dont actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top generally speaking works I think if you treat people well people will come back and come back for more And I think all you have in life is your reputation and its a very small world And I actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well and I like to think thats how we run Virgin CA And what about the people who love you and who see you spending  you keep getting caught up in these new projects but it almost feels like youre addicted to launching new stuff You get excited by an idea and kapow I mean do you think about life balance How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new RB I also believe that being a fathers incredibly important so from the time the kids were very young you know when they go on holiday I go on holiday with them And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together Yes Ill you know be in touch Were very lucky we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can  so I can take them there and we can bring friends and we can play together but I can also keep in touch with whats going on CA You started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy What is that RB Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works You know the alternative communism has not worked But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people and therefore extreme responsibility I think goes with that wealth And I think its important that the individuals who are in that fortunate position do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats and bigger and bigger cars but you know use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world CA And what are the issues that you worry about most care most about want to turn your resources toward RB Well theres  I mean theres a lot of issues I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into A trying to come up with alternative fuels and B you know we just launched this prize which is really a prize in case we dont get an answer on alternative fuels in case we dont actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly and in case we go through the tipping point We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the Earths atmosphere And we just  you know there werent really people working on that before so we wanted people to try to  all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earths atmosphere as well And actually weve had about  people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go And so we only need one so were hopeful CA And youre also working in Africa on a couple of projects RB Yes I mean weve got  were setting up something called the war room which is maybe the wrong word Were trying to  maybe well change it  but anyway its a war room to try to coordinate all the attack thats going on in Africa all the different social problems in Africa and try to look at best practices So for instance theres a doctor in Africa thats found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at  weeks when shes pregnant that the baby will not have HIV when its born And so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important CA The war room sounds it sounds powerful and dramatic And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about  I mean theyre used to having an idea getting stuff done and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say weve got to fix this problem and we can do it Ive got all these billions of dollars you know da da da  heres the big idea And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it Do you worry about that RB Well first of all on this particular situation were actually  were working with the government on it I mean Thabo Mbekis had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related but this is a way I think of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him its a way of working with him with his government Its important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help they dont just go in there and then leave after a few years Its got to be consistent But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial knowhow and help governments approach things slightly differently For instance were setting up clinics in Africa where were going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs free TB treatment and free malaria treatment But were also trying to make them selfsustaining clinics so that people pay for some other aspects CA I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself or Bill Gates or whatever that this is really being  its almost driven by some sort of desire again you know for the right image for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct What would you say to them RB Well I think that everybody  people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and I think that you know when Im on me deathbed I will want to feel that Ive made a difference to other peoples lives And that may be a selfish thing to think but its the way Ive been brought up I think if Im in a position to radically change other peoples lives for the better I should do so CA How old are you RB Im  CA I mean the psychologist Erik Erikson says that  as I understand him and Im a total amateur  but that during s s people are driven by this desire to grow and thats where they get their fulfillment s s the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy I mean it seems like youre still a little bit in the growth phases youre still doing these incredible new plans How much do you think about legacy and what would you like your legacy to be RB I dont think I think too much about legacy I mean I like to  you know my grandmother lived to  so hopefully Ive got another  or  years to go No I just want to live life to its full You know if I can make a difference I hope to be able to make a difference And I think one of the positive things at the moment is youve got Sergey and Larry from Google for instance who are good friends And thank God youve got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth If they had that kind of wealth and they didnt care about the world it would be very worrying And you know theyre going to make a hell of a difference to the world And I think its important that people in that kind of position do make a difference CA Well Richard when I was starting off in business I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of  I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding And you actually did inspire me I looked at you I thought well hes made it Maybe there is a different way So I would like to thank you for that inspiration and for coming to TED today Thank you Thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

182,What I am always thinking about is what this session is about which is called simplicity And almost I would almost call it being simpleminded but in the best sense of the word Im trying to figure out two very simple things how to live and how to die period Thats all Im trying to do all day long And Im also trying to have some meals and have some snacks and you know and yell at my children and do all the normal things that keep you grounded So I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child My older sister was busy torturing my parents and they were busy torturing her I was lucky enough to be completely ignored which is a fabulous thing actually I want to tell you So I was able to completely daydream my way through my life And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU at a very good time in  where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him And feminists hated us and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end But I kept writing bad poetry and he didnt blow up the math building but he went to Cuba But I gave him the money because I was from Riverdale so I had more money than he did And that was a good thing to help you know the cause But then he came back and things happened and I decided I really hated my writing that it was awful awful purple prose And I decided that I wanted to tell  but I still wanted to tell a narrative story and I still wanted to tell my stories So I decided that I would start to draw How hard could that be And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through you know sheer whatever sheer ignorance And we started a studio Well Tibor really started the studio called MampCo And the premise of MampCo was we dont know anything but thats all right were going to do it anyway And as a matter of fact its better not to know anything because if you know too much youre stymied So the premise in the studio was there are no boundaries there is no fear And I  and my fulltime job I landed the best job on Earth was to daydream and to actually come up with absurd ideas that  fortunately there were enough people there and it was a team it was a collective it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas But the point was that I was there as myself as a dreamer And so some of the things  I mean it was a long history of MampCo and clearly we also needed to make some money so we decided we would create a series of products And some of the watches there attempting to be beautiful and humorous  maybe not attempting hopefully succeeding That to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us It was a very high it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say the content is whats important not the package not the wrapping You really have to be journalists you have to be inventors you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything So the good news is that I have a dog and though I dont know if I believe in luck  I dont know what I believe in its a very complicated question but I do know that before I go away I crank his tail seven times So whenever he sees a suitcase in the house because everybodys always you know leaving theyre always cranking this wonderful dogs tail and he runs to the other room But I am able to make the transition from working for children and  from working for adults to children and back and forth because you know I can say that Im immature and in a way thats true I dont really  I mean I could tell you that I didnt understand Im not proud of it but I didnt understand lets say  percent of the talks at this conference But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray GellManns talk And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodhams talk So good things come out of you know incomprehension   which I will do a painting of and then it will end up in my work So Im open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new So in writing for children it seems simple and it is You have to condense a story into  pages usually And what you have to do is you really have to edit down to what you want to say And hopefully youre not talking down to kids and youre not talking in such a way that you you know couldnt stand reading it after one time So I hopefully am writing you know books that are good for children and for adults But the painting reflects  I dont think differently for children than I do for adults I try to use the same kind of imagination the same kind of whimsy the same kind of love of language So you know and I have lots of wonderfullooking friends This is Andrew Gatz and he walked in through the door and I said You Sit down there You know I take lots of photos And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair So I get to put in all of the things that I love Hopefully a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve And the books are really journals of my life I never  I dont like plots I dont know what a plot means I cant stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning you know beginning middle and end It really scares me because my life is too random and too confused and I enjoy it that way But anyway so we were in Venice and this is our room And I had this dream that I was wearing this fantastic green gown and I was looking out the window and it was really a beautiful thing And so I was able to put that into this story which is an alphabet and hopefully go on to something else The letter C had other things in it I was fortunate also to meet the man whos sitting on the bed though I gave him hair over here and he doesnt have hair Well he has some hair but  well he used to have hair And with him I was able to do a project that was really fantastic I work for the New Yorker and I do covers and  happened and it was you know a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx and somebody said Bronxistan and somebody said Ferreristan and we came up with this New Yorker cover which we were able to  we didnt know what we were doing We werent trying to be funny we werent trying to be  well we were trying to be funny actually thats not true We hoped wed be funny but we didnt know it would be a cover and we didnt know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people And it really became the  I dont know you know it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on And from you know Fattushis to Taxistan to you know for the Fashtoonks Botoxia Pashmina Khlintunisia you know we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign who are  whats going on over here Who are these people What are these tribes And David Remnick who was really wonderful about it had one problem He didnt like Al Zheimers because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimers But you know we said David whos going to know Theyre not So it stayed in and it was and you know it was a good thing You know in the course of my life I never know whats going to happen and thats kind of the beauty part And we were on Cape Cod a place obviously of great inspiration and I picked up this book The Elements of Style at a yard sale And I didnt  and Id never used it in school because I was too busy writing poems and flunking out and I dont know what sitting in cafes But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought this book is amazing I said people should know about this book So I decided it needed a few  it needed a lift it needed a few illustrations And basically I called the you know I convinced the White Estate and what an intersection of like you know Polish Jew you know main WASP family Here I am saying Id like to do something to this book And they said yes and they left me completely alone which was a gorgeous wonderful thing And I took the examples that they gave and just did  paintings basically So this is I dont know if you can read this Well Susan this is a fine mess you are in And when youre dealing with grammar which is you know incredibly dry EB White wrote such wonderful whimsical  and actually Strunk  and then you come to the rules and you know there are lots of grammar things Do you mind me asking a question Do you mind my asking a question Would could should or would should could And would is Coco Chanels lover should is Edith Sitwell and could is an August Sander subject And He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug So theres a kind of British understatement murdermystery theme that I really love very much And then Be obscure clearly Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand EB White wrote us a number of rules which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time or you can ignore them which I do or you can I dont know what you know eat a sandwich So what I did when I was painting was I started singing because I really adore singing and I think that music is the highest form of all art So I commissioned a wonderful composer Nico Muhly who wrote nine songs using the text and we performed this fantastic evening of  he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals I played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the New York Public Library where youre supposed to be very very quiet and it was a phenomenally wonderful event which we hopefully will do some more Who knows The New York TimesSelect the oped page asked me to do a column and they said you can do whatever you want So once a month for the last year Ive been doing a column called The Principles of Uncertainty which you know I dont know who Heisenberg is but I know I can throw that around now You know its the principles of uncertainty so you know Im going to read quickly  and probably Im going to edit some because I dont have that much time left  a few of the columns And basically I was so you know it was so amusing because I said Well how much space do I have And they said Well you know its the Internet And I said Yes but how much space do I have And they said Its unlimited its unlimited OK So the first one I was very timid and Ill begin How can I tell you everything that is in my heart Impossible to begin Enough No Begin with the hapless dodo And I talk about the dodo and how the dodo became extinct and then I talk about Spinoza As the last dodo was dying Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything called eudaemonia And then he breathed his last with loved ones around him and I know that he had chicken soup also as his last meal I happen to know it for a fact And then he died and there was no more Spinoza Extinct And then we dont have a stuffed Spinoza but we do have a stuffed Pavlovs dog and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St Petersburg in Russia And there he is with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic decrepit palace And I think it must have been a very very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrived Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs but Stalin was a paranoid man even more than my father You dont even know And decided his top people had to be extinctified Which I think I made up which is a good thing And so this is a chart of you know just a small chart because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed So shot dead smacked over the head you know thrown away Nabokovs family fled Russia How could the young Nabokov sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair leafing through a book and butterflies imagine such displacement such loss And then I want to tell you that this is a map So My beautiful mothers family fled Russia as well Too many pogroms Leaving the shack the wild blueberry woods the geese the River Sluch they went to Palestine and then America And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America and that is my DNA over here because that person who I grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever Facts were actually banished from our home And so if you see that Texas  you know Texas and California are under Canada and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina this is the home that I grew up in OK So its a miracle that Im here today But actually its not Its actually a wonderful thing But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin which is the town they came from and Sorry the rest unknown thank you But in her lexicon sorry the rest unknown thank you is sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she couldnt care less The Impossibility of February is that Februarys a really wretched month in New York and the images for me conjure up these really awful things Well not so awful I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead And I say I hope hes not really dead just enjoying a refreshing liedown in the snow but the caption says he is dead And actually he was I think hes dead though I dont know maybe hes not dead And this woman leans over in anguish not about that man but about all sad things It happens quite often in February Theres consoling This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase and basically  you know I guess onions are a theme here And he says It is impossible not to lie It is February and not lying is impossible And I really spend a lot of time wondering how much truth do we tell What is it that were actually  what story are we actually telling How do we know when we are ourselves How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories you know are real sentences Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying Im going to quickly go through this A quote by Bertrand Russell All the labor of all the ages all the devotion all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction So now my friends if that is true and it is true what is the point A complicated question And so you know I talk to my friends and I go to plays where theyre singing Russian songs Oh my God you know what Could we have  no we dont have time I taped my aunt I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the  you know could we have it for a second Do you have that Music OK I taped my  my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about  So  and thats a song about how everybodys miserable because you know were from Russia I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart and she is  and when I brought her a copy of The Elements of Style she said she would treasure it And then I said  oh and she was talking about Moss Hart and I said When you met him you knew it was him And she said I knew it was he So I was the one who should have kept the book but it was a really wonderful moment And she dated George Gershwin so you know get out Gershwin died at the age of  Hes buried in the same cemetery as my husband I dont want to talk about that now I do want to talk  the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate And I would like to run it for them And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise whos also still working and I looked at her sink which is really amazing and left And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street And a woman who lives on our street Lolita And then I go and have some tea And then my Aunt Frances dies and before she died she tried to pay with SweetN Low packets for her bagel And I wonder what the point is and then I know and I see that Hy Meyerowitz Rick Meyerowitzs father a drycleaning supply salesman from the Bronx won the Charlie Chaplin lookalike contest in  Thats actually Hy And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine And it says Ich habe genug which is a Bach cantata which I once thought meant Ive had it I cant take it anymore give me a break but I was wrong It means I have enough And that is utterly true I happen to be alive end of discussion Thank you

183,"Theres an ancient and universal concept
that words have power that spells exist and that if we could only
pronounce the right words then  whoosh  you know
an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits right So this is a very attractive idea because were very lazy
like the Sorcerers Apprentice or the worlds greatest
computer programmer This idea has a lot of traction with us We love the idea that words
when pronounced are little more than pure information but they evoke physical action
in the real world that helps us do work So of course with lots
of programmable computers and robots around this is an easy thing to picture How many of you know
what Im talking about Raise your right hand How many dont know
what Im talking about Raise your left hand So thats great So that was too easy You guys have very insecure computers OK So now the thing is
this is a different kind of spell This is a computer program
made of zeros and ones It can be pronounced on a computer
does something like this The important thing is we can write it
in a highlevel language A computer magician can write this thing It can be compiled into zeros and ones
and pronounced by a computer And thats what makes computers powerful these highlevel languages
that can be compiled And so Im here to tell you
you dont need a computer to actually have a spell In fact what you can do
at the molecular level is that if you encode information  you encode a spell
or program as molecules  then physics can actually directly
interpret that information and run a program Its what happens in proteins When this aminoacid sequence
gets pronounced as atoms these little letters
are sticky for each other It collapses into a threedimensional
shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA The interesting thing
is that if you change the sequence you change the threedimensional folding You get now a DNA stapler instead These are the kind of molecular programs
we want to be able to write The problem is we dont know the machine language of proteins
or have a compiler for proteins So Ive joined a growing band of people that try to make
molecular spells using DNA We use DNA because its cheaper
its easier to handle its something
we understand really well  so well in fact that we think
we can actually write programming languages for DNA
and have molecular compilers So then we think we can do that One of my first questions doing this was How can you make an arbitrary shape
or pattern out of DNA I decided to use a type of DNA origami where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape
or pattern you might want So heres a shape I actually spent about a year in my home
in my underwear coding like Linus Torvalds
in that picture before This program takes a shape
and spits out  DNA sequences These short DNA sequences
are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make So you send an email
with these sequences in it to a company and the company pronounces them
on a DNA synthesizer a machine about the size of a photocopier And they take your email and every letter in your email
they replace with a atom cluster  one for each letter A T C and G in DNA They string them up in the right sequence and then they send them
back to you via FedEx So you get  of these
in the mail in little tubes I mix them together
add a little bit of salt water and then add this long strand
I was telling you about that Ive stolen from a virus And then what happens is you heat this whole thing up
to about boiling You cool it down to room temperature and as you do those short strands
do the following thing each one of them binds
that long strand in one place and then has a second half that binds
that long strand in a distant place and brings those two parts
of the long strand close together so they stick together So the net effect
of all  of these strands is to fold the long strand
into the shape youre looking for Itll approximate that shape We do this for real in the test tube In each little drop of water
you get  billion of these guys With a microscope
you can see them on a surface The neat thing is if you change
the sequence and change the spell just change the sequence of the staples you can make a molecule
that looks like this And you know he likes
to hang out with his buddies A lot of them are actually pretty good If you change the spell again
you change the sequence again you get really nice
nanometer triangles If you do it again you can get arbitrary patterns So on a rectangle you can paint
patterns of North and South America or the words DNA So thats DNA origami Thats one way There are many ways
of casting molecular spells using DNA What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program selfassembly
so we can build anything right We want to be able to build
technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world We want to learn how to build
biological artifacts like people and whales and trees And if its the case that we can reach
that level of complexity if our ability to program molecules
gets to be that good then that will truly be magic Thank you very much ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

184,Well as Chris pointed out I study the human brain the functions and structure of the human brain And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails Here is this mass of jelly threepound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity And this peculiar recursive quality that we call selfawareness which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience of neurology and hopefully someday well understand how that happens OK so how do you study this mysterious organ I mean you have  billion nerve cells little wisps of protoplasm interacting with each other and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness How does this happen Well there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain One approach the one we use mainly is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain where theres been a genetic change in a small region of the brain What then happens is not an acrosstheboard reduction in all your mental capacities a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability What you get is a highly selective loss of one function with other functions being preserved intact and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function So you can then map function onto structure and then find out what the circuitrys doing to generate that particular function So thats what were trying to do So let me give you a few striking examples of this In fact Im giving you three examples six minutes each during this talk The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome If you look at the first slide there thats the temporal lobes frontal lobes parietal lobes OK  the lobes that constitute the brain And if you look tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes  you cant see it there  is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus And thats been called the face area in the brain because when its damaged you can no longer recognize peoples faces You can still recognize them from their voice and say Oh yeah thats Joe but you cant look at their face and know who it is right You cant even recognize yourself in the mirror I mean you know its you because you wink and it winks and you know its a mirror but you dont really recognize yourself as yourself OK Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus But theres another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few physicians have heard about it not even neurologists This is called the Capgras delusion and that is a patient whos otherwise completely normal has had a head injury comes out of coma otherwise completely normal he looks at his mother and says This looks exactly like my mother this woman but shes an impostor Shes some other woman pretending to be my mother Now why does this happen Why would somebody  and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects but when he sees his mother his delusion kicks in and says its not mother Now the most common interpretation of this which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks is a Freudian view and that is that this chap  and the same argument applies to women by the way but Ill just talk about guys When youre a little baby a young baby you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother This is the socalled Oedipus complex of Freud Im not saying I believe this but this is the standard Freudian view And then as you grow up the cortex develops and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother Thank God or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother And then what happens is theres a blow to your head damaging the cortex allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge flaming to the surface and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother And you say My God if this is my mom how come Im being sexually turned on Shes some other woman Shes an impostor Its the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain This has never made much sense to me this argument Its very ingenious as all Freudian arguments are   but didnt make much sense because I have seen the same delusion a patient having the same delusion about his pet poodle Hell say Doctor this is not Fifi It looks exactly like Fifi but its some other dog Right Now you try using the Freudian explanation there Youll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans or some such thing which is quite absurd of course Now whats really going on So to explain this curious disorder we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain Normally visual signals come in into the eyeballs go to the visual areas in the brain There are in fact  areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision and after processing all that the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus where you perceive faces There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces You can call it the face area of the brain right I talked about that earlier Now when that areas damaged you lose the ability to see faces right But from that area the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system the emotional core of the brain and that structure called the amygdala gauges the emotional significance of what youre looking at Is it prey Is it predator Is it mate Or is it something absolutely trivial like a piece of lint or a piece of chalk or a  I dont want to point to that but  or a shoe or something like that OK Which you can completely ignore So if the amygdala is excited and this is something important the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system Your heart starts beating faster You start sweating to dissipate the heat that youre going to create from muscular exertion And thats fortunate because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating So I can determine when youre looking at something whether youre excited or whether youre aroused or not OK And Ill get to that in a minute So my idea was when this chap looks at an object when he looks at his  any object for that matter it goes to the visual areas and however and its processed in the fusiform gyrus and you recognize it as a pea plant or a table or your mother for that matter OK And then the message cascades into the amygdala and then goes down the autonomic nervous system But maybe in this chap that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system the emotional core of the brain is cut by the accident So because the fusiform is intact the chap can still recognize his mother and says Oh yeah this looks like my mother But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers he says But how come if its my mother I dont experience a warmth Or terror as the case may be Right And therefore he says How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions This cant be my mother Its some strange woman pretending to be my mother How do you test this Well what you do is if you take any one of you here and put you in front of a screen and measure your galvanic skin response and show pictures on the screen I can measure how you sweat when you see an object like a table or an umbrella Of course you dont sweat If I show you a picture of a lion or a tiger or a pinup you start sweating right And believe it or not if I show you a picture of your mother  Im talking about normal people  you start sweating You dont even have to be Jewish Now what happens if you show this patient You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response Tables and chairs and lint nothing happens as in normal people but when you show him a picture of his mother the galvanic skin response is flat Theres no emotional reaction to his mother because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal his emotions are normal  hell laugh hell cry so on and so forth  but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor Its a lovely example of the sort of thing we do take a bizarre seemingly incomprehensible neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong that in fact you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain By the way if this patient then goes and mother phones from an adjacent room  phones him  and he picks up the phone and he says Wow mom how are you Where are you Theres no delusion through the phone Then she approaches him after an hour he says Who are you You look just like my mother OK The reason is theres a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers and thats not been cut by the accident So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother no problem When he sees her in person he says its an impostor OK how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain Is it nature genes or is it nurture And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb And you all know what a phantom limb is When an arm is amputated or a leg is amputated for gangrene or you lose it in war  for example in the Iraq war its now a serious problem  you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm and thats called a phantom arm or a phantom leg In fact you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body Believe it or not even with internal viscera Ive had patients with the uterus removed  hysterectomy  who have a phantom uterus including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month And in fact one student asked me the other day Do they get phantom PMS A subject ripe for scientific enquiry but we havent pursued that OK now the next question is what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments One of the things weve found was about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom Itll pat his brother on the shoulder itll answer the phone when it rings itll wave goodbye These are very compelling vivid sensations The patients not delusional He knows that the arm is not there but nevertheless its a compelling sensory experience for the patient But however about half the patients this doesnt happen The phantom limb  theyll say But doctor the phantom limb is paralyzed Its fixed in a clenched spasm and its excruciatingly painful If only I could move it maybe the pain will be relieved Now why would a phantom limb be paralyzed It sounds like an oxymoron But when we were looking at the case sheets what we found was these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed was cut by say a motorcycle accident So the patient had an actual arm which is painful in a sling for a few months or a year and then in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm the surgeon amputates the arm and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains right And this is a serious clinical problem Patients become depressed Some of them are driven to suicide OK So how do you treat this syndrome Now why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb When I looked at the case sheet I found that they had an actual arm and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut and the actual arm had been paralyzed and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself Why does this happen When the arm was intact but paralyzed the brain sends commands to the arm the front of the brain saying Move but its getting visual feedback saying No Move No Move No Move No And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain and we call this learned paralysis OK The brain learns because of this Hebbian associative link that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm And then when youve amputated the arm this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom OK Now how do you help these patients How do you unlearn the learned paralysis so you can relieve him of this excruciating clenching spasm of the phantom arm Well we said what if you now send the command to the phantom but give him visual feedback that its obeying his command right Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain the phantom cramp How do you do that Well virtual reality But that costs millions of dollars So I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars but dont tell my funding agencies OK What you do is you create what I call a mirror box You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle and then you put the phantom  so my first patient Derek came in He had his arm amputated  years ago He had a brachial avulsion so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed lying in a sling for a year and then the arm was amputated He had a phantom arm excruciatingly painful and he couldnt move it It was a paralyzed phantom arm So he came there and I gave him a mirror like that in a box which I call a mirror box right And the patient puts his phantom left arm which is clenched and in spasm on the left side of the mirror and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror and makes the same posture the clenched posture and looks inside the mirror And what does he experience He looks at the phantom being resurrected because hes looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected Now I said now look wiggle your phantom  your real fingers or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror Hes going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving right Thats obvious but the astonishing thing is the patient then says Oh my God my phantom is moving again and the pain the clenching spasm is relieved And remember my first patient who came in   thank you Applause My first patient came in and he looked in the mirror and I said Look at your reflection of your phantom And he started giggling he says I can see my phantom But hes not stupid He knows its not real He knows its a mirror reflection but its a vivid sensory experience Now I said Move your normal hand and phantom He said Oh I cant move my phantom You know that Its painful I said Move your normal hand And he says Oh my God my phantom is moving again I dont believe this And my pain is being relieved OK And then I said Close your eyes He closes his eyes And move your normal hand Oh nothing Its clenched again OK open your eyes Oh my God oh my God its moving again So he was like a kid in a candy store So I said OK this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input but Im not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb Its a completely useless ability if you think about it But then I started realizing maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology like stroke focal dystonias  there may be a learned component to this which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror So I said Look Derek  well first of all the guy cant just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain  I said Look Derek take it home and practice with it for a week or two Maybe after a period of practice you can dispense with the mirror unlearn the paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm and then relieve yourself of pain So he said OK and he took it home I said Look its after all two dollars Take it home So he took it home and after two weeks he phones me and he said Doctor youre not going to believe this I said What He said Its gone I said Whats gone I thought maybe the mirror box was gone He said No no no you know this phantom Ive had for the last  years Its disappeared And I said  I got worried I said my God I mean Ive changed this guys body image what about human subjects ethics and all of that And I said Derek does this bother you He said No last three days Ive not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain no clenching no phantom forearm pain all those pains are gone away But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder and your box doesnt reach So can you change the design and put it on my forehead so I can you know do this and eliminate my phantom fingers He thought I was some kind of magician Now why does this happen Its because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict Its getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back On the other hand theres no proprioception muscle signals saying that there is no arm right And your motor command saying there is an arm and because of this conflict the brain says to hell with it there is no phantom there is no arm right It goes into a sort of denial  it gates the signals And when the arm disappears the bonus is the pain disappears because you cant have disembodied pain floating out there in space So thats the bonus Now this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain and indeed people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers nothing you can do about it But it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors This has also gone through clinical trials helping lots and lots of patients OK let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century He was a cousin of Charles Darwin He pointed out that certain people in the population who are otherwise completely normal had the following peculiarity every time they see a number its colored Five is blue seven is yellow eight is chartreuse nine is indigo OK Bear in mind these people are completely normal in other respects Or C sharp  sometimes tones evoke color C sharp is blue F sharp is green another tone might be yellow right Why does this happen This is called synesthesia Galton called it synesthesia a mingling of the senses In us all the senses are distinct These people muddle up their senses Why does this happen One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing Synesthesia runs in families so Galton said this is a hereditary basis a genetic basis Secondly synesthesia is about  and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture which is about creativity  synesthesia is eight times more common among artists poets novelists and other creative people than in the general population Why would that be Im going to answer that question Its never been answered before OK what is synesthesia What causes it Well there are many theories One theory is theyre just crazy Now thats not really a scientific theory so we can forget about it Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads right Now there may be some truth to this because its much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego OK Now the third theory is that  well lets ask ourselves whats really going on in synesthesia All right So we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain in the fusiform gyrus So we said theres some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain So every time you see a number you see a corresponding color and thats why you get synesthesia Now remember  why does this happen Why would there be crossed wires in some people Remember I said it runs in families That gives you the clue And that is there is an abnormal gene a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring In all of us it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else So every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain So if theres a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas And if its between number and color you get numbercolor synesthesia If its between tone and color you get tonecolor synesthesia So far so good Now what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain so everything is crossconnected Well think about what artists novelists and poets have in common the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking linking seemingly unrelated ideas such as It is the east and Juliet is the Sun Well you dont say Juliet is the sun does that mean shes a glowing ball of fire I mean schizophrenics do that but its a different story right Normal people say shes warm like the sun shes radiant like the sun shes nurturing like the sun Instantly youve found the links Now if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain then its going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia And hence the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets artists and novelists OK its a very phrenological view of synesthesia The last demonstration  can I take one minute OK Im going to show you that youre all synesthetes but youre in denial about it Heres what I call Martian alphabet Just like your alphabet A is A B is B C is C Different shapes for different phonemes right Here youve got Martian alphabet One of them is Kiki one of them is Bouba Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba How many of you think thats Kiki and thats Bouba Raise your hands Well its one or two mutants How many of you think thats Bouba thats Kiki Raise your hands Ninetynine percent of you Now none of you is a Martian How did you do that Its because youre all doing a crossmodel synesthetic abstraction meaning youre saying that that sharp inflection  kiki in your auditory cortex the hair cells being excited  Kiki mimics the visual inflection sudden inflection of that jagged shape Now this is very important because what its telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive  its just  it looks like a silly illusion but these photons in your eye are doing this shape and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern but the brain is able to extract the common denominator Its a primitive form of abstraction and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain because when thats damaged these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor If you ask this guy what  all that glitters is not gold what does that mean The patient says Well if its metallic and shiny it doesnt mean its gold You have to measure its specific gravity OK So they completely miss the metaphorical meaning So this area is about eight times the size in higher  especially in humans  as in lower primates Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus because its the crossroads between hearing vision and touch and it became enormous in humans And something very interesting is going on And I think its a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction metaphor and creativity All of

185,You know theres a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains far from these beautiful mountains where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product And why not After all happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few but a fundamental human right for all And what is happiness Happiness is the freedom of choice The freedom to chose where to live what to do what to buy what to sell from whom to whom when and how Where does choice come from And who gets to express it and how do we express it Well one way to express choice is through the market Wellfunctioning markets provide choices and ultimately the ability to express ones pursuit for happiness The great Indian economist Amartya Sen was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market In  in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth Ethiopia Not because there was not enough food  because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country  but because in the north people could not access or entitle themselves to that food That was a turning point for my life Most Africans today by far are farmers And most of Africas farmers are by and large small farmers in terms of land that they operate and very very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal African agriculture today is among or is the most undercapitalized in the world Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated compared to  percent in Asia African farmers only use some  kilograms of fertilizer per hectare compared to  in Asia Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa There are eight times more tractors in Latin America and three times more tractors in Asia than in Africa The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice and therefore without much freedom His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty He comes to the market when prices are lowest with the meager fruits of his hard labor just after the harvest because he has no choice She comes back to the market some months later when prices are highest in what we call the lean season  when food is scarce  because she has to feed her family and has no choice The real question is how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists Another notable economist Theodore Schultz in  won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient but poor Meaning in fact that farmers are rational and profitminded just like everybody else Well we dont need now any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money just like everyone else And one thing is clear which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business And that business is agriculture Over two decades ago the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized that economies must be structurally adjusted This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling  which they did rather inefficiently  and let the private market do its magic Well what happened over the last  years Did Africa feed itself Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors I think were all in this room probably because we know that in fact Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next  years where the food import bill is now double what it was  years ago where food production per capita has stagnated and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased So why didnt agriculture markets perform to expectations The market reforms prompted by the West  and Ive spent some  years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets and have interviewed traders in  to  countries in this continent hundreds of traders  trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water Like its agriculture Africas markets are highly undercapitalized and inefficient We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market and the risks of transacting in rural agriculture markets are extremely high In fact only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market Africas markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions such as market information grades and standards and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers Because of this commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles in narrow networks of people they know and trust And because of that as grain changes hands  and Ive measured that it changes hands four five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer  every time it changes hands  and Ive seen this all over rural Africa  it also changes sacks And I thought that was incredibly peculiar And really realized that that was because  as traders would tell me over and over  thats the only way people know what theyre getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals and situations where there are deficits for example It also has very high cost implications I have measured that  percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that because of the absence of grades and standards and market information sacks have to be constantly changed And this leads to very high handling costs For their part small farmers who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa come to the market with virtually no information at all  blind  trusting that theyre going to have some sort of demand for their produce and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market the nearest local market they know  where theyre unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk Speaking of risk we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world In Africa small farmers bear the brunt of this risk In fact in my view there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africas farmers have to bear And in my view there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face In Ethiopia for example the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as  percent annually This kind of market risk is mindboggling and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology such as modern seeds and fertilizers but also direct implications for food security To give you an example between  and  Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest That in turn because of the weak marketing system led to an  percent collapse in maize prices in the country This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields And we calculated that some  tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early  Not six months later in July  Ethiopia announced a major food crisis to the same proportions as   million people at risk of starvation What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by  percent This is a tragic example of arrested development or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks And this is not just specific to Ethiopia but happens over and over all over Africa Well Im not here today to lament about the situation or wring my hands I am here to tell you that change is in the air Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions or cookiecutter foreign expert policy prescriptions Africa has learned or is learning somewhat slowly that markets dont happen by themselves In the s it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right There was a very influential book about that which was mainly about getting governments out of the market We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market When conditions are right we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa just like anywhere else Nearly three years ago I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth Ethiopia after nearly  years abroad I did so for a simple reason After having spent more than a decade understanding studying and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africas agricultural markets I decided it was time to do something about it I currently lead in Ethiopia an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange or ECX Now the commodity exchange itself that concept is not new to the world In fact in   grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves That was of course the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange In the American Midwest farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market But once it arrived if no buyer was to be found or if prices suddenly dropped farmers would incur tremendous losses And in fact would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms Well the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting  issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done From there the greatest innovation of all came about in this market which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances and even across time  as far forward as  months into the future This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture and the rise of Chicago to a global market agricultural market superpower from where it was a small regional town Now over the last century we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries and that the reference prices for cotton coffee cocoa  products produced mainly in the south  are actually a reference price or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries But that is actually changing And were seeing a shift  powered mainly because of information technology  a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets And over the last decade you see that the share of Western exchanges  and this is the US share of exchanges in the world  has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade Similarly theres been explosive growth in India for example where rural farmers are using exchanges  growing here over the last three years by  percent a year This is powered by lowcost VSAT technology aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market Chinas Dalian Commodity Exchange three years ago  overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world Now in Ethiopia were in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange Were not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopias needs and realities Ethiopias small farmers So the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia Were creating a system that serves all market actors that creates integrity trust efficiency transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia weve done something rather unique which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective or what we call the ECX Edge The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself And this is because one of the things weve learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work Youve got one donor trying to develop market information another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards another ICT and yet another on warehousing or warehouse receipts In our approach in Ethiopia weve decided to put together the entire ecosystem or environment in which trade takes place That means that the exchange will operate a trading system which will initially start as an open outcry because we dont think the countrys ready for full electronic trading But at the same time well do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center  what we call the remote access terminal centers  and actually without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things simply see the trading thats happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor At the same time whats very fundamental to this market is that  and again an innovation that weve designed for our exchange  is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done And in turn well operate an inhouse clearing system to assure that payment is done appropriately in the right amount and at the right time so that basically we create trust and integrity in the system Obviously we work with exchange actors and as were developing the exchange market itself were also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework the overarching legal framework for making this market work So in fact our proclamation is going to parliament next month Whats really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers What this does is transforms fundamentally the farmers relationship to the market Whereas before the farmer used to think local  meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market eight to  kilometers away on average and sell whatever they happened to have without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was  now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market And they start to think national and even global They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions but also planting decisions on the basis of information coming from the futures price market And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium So all of this will transform farmers It will also transform the way traders do business It will stop them from doing simple backtoback limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from surplus regions to deficit areas Can Ethiopia do this It seems very ambitious But it will create new opportunities We believe that this initiative requires great political will and well have to align the financial sector as well as the ICT sector and really even the underlying legal framework We believe that the winds of change are here and that we can do it ECX is the market for Ethiopias new millennium which starts in about eight months The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today We believe that the stakes are high but that the returns will be even greater ECX moreover can become a trading platform for a panAfrican market in agricultural commodities Ethiopias domestic market is about one billion dollars of value And we feel that over the next five years if Ethiopia can capture even  percent just  percent of the domestic market and add just  percent value to that market the value of the market doubles Ethiopias agricultural market is  percent higher than South Africas grain production and in fact Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa So the potential is there The will is there The commitment is there So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers choices to grow our agriculture and to change Africa So we are in the business of finding our happiness Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

187,I want to talk to you a little bit about usergenerated content Im going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument thats going to tell you a little bit about how we open usergenerated content up for business So heres the first story  This man John Philip Sousa traveled to this place the United States Capitol to talk about this technology what he called the quote talking machines Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines This is what he had to say These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country When I was a boy in front of every house in the summer evenings you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or the old songs Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day We will not have a vocal chord left Sousa said The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the ape Now this is the picture I want you to focus on This is a picture of culture We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of readwrite culture Its a culture where people participate in the creation and the recreation of their culture In that sense its readwrite Sousas fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these quote infernal machines They would take it away And in its place wed have the opposite of readwrite culture what we could call readonly culture Culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator A culture which is topdown owned where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost Now as you look back at the twentieth century at least in what we think of as the quote developed world  hard not to conclude that Sousa was right Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized never before as concentrated Never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced and displaced because of these quote infernal machines The twentieth century was that century where at least for those places we know the best culture moved from this readwrite to readonly existence So second Land is a kind of property  it is property Its protected by law As Lord Blackstone described it land is protected by trespass law for most of the history of trespass law by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward Now that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land until this technology came along and people began to wonder were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country Well in  Supreme Court got a chance to address that question Two farmers Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby who raised chickens had a significant complaint because of these technologies The complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of the barn when the airplanes flew over the land And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing Since time immemorial the law had said you cant fly over the land without permission of the landowner so this flight must stop Well the Supreme Court considered this years tradition and said in an opinion written by Justice Douglas that the Causbys must lose The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world otherwise every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits Common sense a rare idea in the law but here it was Common sense  Laughter  Revolts at the idea Common sense Finally Before the Internet the last great terror to rain down on the content industry was a terror created by this technology Broadcasting a new way to spread content and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread content Now at that time the entity the legal cartel that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ASCAP They had an exclusive license on the most popular content and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge So between  and  they raised rates by some  percent until the broadcasters finally got together and said okay enough of this And in  a lawyer Sydney Kaye started something called Broadcast Music Inc We know it as BMI And BMI was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire including African American music for the first time in the repertoire But most important was that BMI took public domain works and made arrangements of them which they gave away for free to their subscribers So that in  when ASCAP threatened to double their rates the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI Now ASCAP said they didnt care The people will revolt they predicted because the very best music was no longer available because they had shifted to the second best public domain provided by BMI Well they didnt revolt and in  ASCAP cracked And the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best that competition was enough to break at that time this legal cartel over access to music Okay Three stories Heres the argument In my view the most significant thing to recognize about what this Internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the readwrite culture that Sousa romanticized Digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about Usergenerated content spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways like these celebrating amateur culture By which I dont mean amateurish culture I mean culture where people produce for the love of what theyre doing and not for the money I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time For when you think of what Sousa romanticized in the young people together singing the songs of the day of the old songs you should recognize what your kids are doing right now Taking the songs of the day and the old songs and remixing them to make them something different Its how they understand access to this culture So lets have some very few examples to get a sense of what Im talking about here Heres something called Anime Music Video first example taking anime captured from television reedited to music tracks Music This one you should be  confidence Jesus survives Dont worry Music And this is the best Music My love  Theres only you in my life  The only thing thats bright  My first love  Youre every breath that I take  Youre every step I make  And I  I want to share all my love with you  No one else will do  And your eyes  They tell me how much you care  Music So this is remix right And its important to emphasize that what this is not is not what we call quote piracy Im not talking about nor justifying people taking other peoples content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner Im talking about people taking and recreating using other peoples content using digital technologies to say things differently Now the importance of this is not the technique that youve seen here Because of course every technique that youve seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last  years The importance is that that technique has been democratized It is now anybody with access to a  computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently These tools of creativity have become tools of speech It is a literacy for this generation This is how our kids speak It is how our kids think It is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship to themselves Now in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies the law has not greeted this Sousa revival with very much common sense Instead the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies as they interact have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies then in the digital world the one fact we cant escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy Every single use therefore requires permission without permission you are a trespasser Youre a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers Common sense here though has not yet revolted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity Instead what weve seen is something much worse than a revolt Theres a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies One side builds new technologies such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like YouTube any content that has any copyrighted content in it whether or not theres a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content And on the other side among our kids theres a growing copyright abolitionism a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other a fact we should have learned many many times over and both extremes in this debate are just wrong Now the balance that I try to fight for I as any good liberal try to fight for first by looking to the government Total mistake right Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense It failed partly because the courts are too passive partly because the legislatures are corrupted by which I dont mean that theres bribery operating to stop real change but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until its too late to fix it So we need something different we need a different kind of solution And the solution here in my view is a private solution a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again and to realize the economic potential of that and thats where the story of BMI becomes relevant Because as BMI demonstrated competition here can achieve some form of balance The same thing can happen now We dont have a public domain to draw upon now so instead what we need is two types of changes First that artists and creators embrace the idea choose that their work be made available more freely So for example they can say their work is available freely for noncommercial this amateurtype of use but not freely for any commercial use And second we need the businesses that are building out this readwrite culture to embrace this opportunity expressly to enable it so that this ecology of free content or freer content can grow on a neutral platform where they both exist simultaneously so that morefree can compete with lessfree and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other Now I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about but I dont want to violate TEDs first commandment of selling so Im not going to talk about this at all Im instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us That artist choice is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity But let me end with something I think much more important  much more important than business Its the point about how this connects to our kids We have to recognize theyre different from us This is us right We made mixed tapes they remix music We watched TV they make TV It is technology that has made them different and as we see what this technology can do we need to recognize you cant kill the instinct the technology produces We can only criminalize it We cant stop our kids from using it We can only drive it underground We cant make our kids passive again We can only make them quote pirates And is that good We live in this weird time Its kind of age of prohibitions where in many areas of our life we live life constantly against the law Ordinary people live life against the law and thats what I  we are doing to our kids They live life knowing they live it against the law That realization is extraordinarily corrosive extraordinarily corrupting And in a democracy we ought to be able to do better Do better at least for them if not for opening for business Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

188,Its really quite an honor to be here tonight and Im really glad that I stayed here and listened because Ive really been inspired And Im going to play some songs for you tonight that are literally world premieres Ive been working on my new record and Ive never played these songs for anybody except the microphone This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology which goes perfectly with this gathering I started thinking about  when I was in college especially as a blind person doing a research paper was a major undertaking You had to go to the library see if you could get them to find the books for you you know footnotes and all that Now you can just go on Google Just look it up I wish I had that when I was in college Anyway this is a song about we have all this but what are we going to do with it Its called All the Answers  What is the weather in Cincinnati   What is the time in Tokyo   Who is this little childs daddy   And who the hell needs to know   Why do memories of you linger   when Im trying to reach my goal   And why must I move my fingers   to the music in my soul   I dont know   I dont have to know   Cause here I go    and I got all the answers   right here in my hand   And I got all the answers   and I dont have to understand   cause I got all the answers   Think Ill rummage through the century   while I listen to the sea   Oh its good to be so free   so free   Who was mayor of Chicago   back in    And why did Shakespeare create Iago   to tear apart a love so pure   How can my dreams be so vivid   in a psychosonic way   Why must I become so livid   about the news I hear today   I dont know   I dont have to know   And here I go    cause I got all the answers   right here in my hand   And I got all the answers   See I dont have to understand   cause I got all the answers   I think Ill browse on through   the tabloid news   while I sip my tea   Mm its good to be so free  Trumpet sounds  I never ever have to be alone   I can do it all right here in my home   Yeah mmhmm    Everything thats ever been known   I can punch it up right here on my phone   Freedom train coming soon   right here in my living room   from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon   and all points in between   Cause I got all the answers   right here on my screen   And I got all the answers yeah   I got every book and magazine   I got all I got all I got all    I got all the answers   all the answers oh yeah   Uhhuh    But I tell you what Im going to do   Im going to find the capitol of Peru   or the latitude of Kathmandu   Im gonna Google it   cause everybodys doing it   And then Ill rummage through the century   I got all I got all I got all    I got all the answers   Yeah yeah   I got all the answers  Thank you Whew Its a miracle I didnt make any mistakes on that song Thats the first time Ive ever played it Its a feel the fear and do it anyway kind of thing This next song is a song that started out as a dream  a childhood dream It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record except theres a couple of problems One thing is its unpronounceable And its a madeup word Its called Tembererana And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces So tembererana was these dreams in which I would be running away from bad feelings  is the only way I can put it So this is called Tembererana Its based on an Argentinian rhythm called carnivalito  A dream within a dream   a world within a world   the sound of a primal scream   travels out across the land   Images flickering   the sound of the war machine   a procession of limousines   travels slowly across the land   Another child could use a hand   Reaching out from within   tembererana hey tembererana    Annihilation moves   The earth is an open tomb   The sound of the final boom   rumbles fiercely across the land   Fear youre the enemy   Obliterating all but thee   You see what you want to see   Before Im blinded I will toast   the shade of power that I love most   the power of creation   Tembererana hey tembererana    Da da da da   Da da da da da da da   As a child alone and afraid   escaping the impressions every feeling made   I would run run away   into a world where the good was the aim of the game   and the sum of invisible power   had a name   Its the same name   Tembererana hey tembererana    Da da da da da da da   Tembere tembere tembere tembererana   Tembere tembere tembere tembererana hey   Tembererana hey   Tembererana   ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

189,Id like to do pretty much what I did the first time which is to choose a lighthearted theme Last time I talked about death and dying This time Im going to talk about mental illness But it has to be technological so Ill talk about electroshock therapy Laughter You know ever since man had any notion that some of his other people his colleagues could be different could be strange could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body So the way of treating these diseases in early times was to in some way or other exorcise those evil spirits and this is still going on as you know But it wasnt enough to use the priests When medicine became somewhat scientific in about  BC with Hippocrates and those boys they tried to look for herbs plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out So they found certain plants that could cause convulsions And the herbals the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out Finally in about the sixteenth century a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim called Paracelsus a name probably familiar to some people here  Laughter  good old Paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion Can you imagine going to your closet pulling out a mothball and chewing on it if youre feeling depressed Its better than Prozac but I wouldnt recommend it So what we see in the seventeenth eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor thatll do the trick Well along comes Benjamin Franklin and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions And then we fastforward to about  when three Italian psychiatrists who were largely treating depression began to notice among their patients who were also epileptics that if they had an epileptic  a series of epileptic fits a lot of them in a row  the depression would very frequently lift Not only would it lift but it might never return So they got very interested in producing convulsions measured types of convulsions And they thought Well weve got electricity well plug somebody into the wall That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot So they tried it on a few pigs and none of the pigs were killed So they went to the police and they said We know that at the Rome railroad station there are all these lost souls wandering around muttering gibberish Can you bring one of them to us Someone who is as the Italians say cagoots So they found this cagoots guy a yearold man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic who was known had been known for months to be literally defecating on himself talking nothing that made any sense and they brought him into the hospital So these three psychiatrists after about two or three weeks of observation laid him down on a table connected his temples to a very small source of current They thought Well well try  volts twotenths of a second Thats not going to do anything terrible to him So they did that Well I have the following from a firsthand observer who told me this about  years ago when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine He said This fellow  remember he wasnt even put to sleep  after this major grand mal convulsion sat right up looked at these three fellas and said What the fuck are you assholes trying to do  If I could only say that in Italian Well they were happy as could be because he hadnt said a rational word in the weeks of observation So they plugged him in again and this time they used  volts for half a second And to their amazement after it was over he began speaking like he was perfectly well He relapsed a little bit they gave him a series of treatments and he was essentially cured But of course having schizophrenia within a few months it returned But they wrote a paper about this and everybody in the Western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed It didnt work very well on the schizophrenics but it was pretty clear in the s and by the middle of the s that electroconvulsive therapy was very very effective in the treatment of depression And of course in those days there were no antidepressant drugs and it became very very popular They would anesthetize people convulse them but the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles So people would have a real grand mal seizure Bones were broken Especially in old fragile people you couldnt use it And then in the s late s the socalled muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion an electroencephalographic convulsion  you could see it on the brain waves  without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes So again it was very very popular and very very useful Well you know in the middle s the first antidepressants came out Tofranil was the first In the late s early s there were others and they were very effective And patients rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive electroshock therapy disappeared but has had a renaissance in the last  years And the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about  percent of the people severe depressives do not respond regardless of what is done for them Now why am I telling you this story at this meeting Im telling you this story because actually ever since Richard called me and asked me to talk about  as he asked all of his speakers  to talk about something that would be new to this audience that we had never talked about never written about Ive been planning this moment This reason really is that I am a man who almost  years ago had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy And let me tell you this story I was in the s in a marriage To use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year It was dreadful There are Im sure enough divorced people in this room to know about the hostility the anger who knows what Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood a very difficult adolescence  it had to do with not quite poverty but close It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English no one could read or write English It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things I was a little prone to depression So as things got worse as we really began to hate each other I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years trying to save this marriage which was inevitably not to be saved Finally I would schedule  all my major surgical cases I was scheduling them for  one oclock in the afternoon because I couldnt get out of bed before about  oclock And anybody whos been depressed here knows what thats like I couldnt even pull the covers off myself Well youre in a university medical center where everybody knows everybody and its perfectly clear to my colleagues so my referrals began to decrease As my referrals began to decrease I clearly became increasingly depressed until I thought my God I cant work anymore And in fact it didnt make any difference because I didnt have any patients anymore So with the advice of my physician I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital And my colleagues who had known me since medical school in that place said Dont worry chap Six weeks youre back in the operating room Everythings going to be great Well you know what bovine stercus is That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that So I was one of their failures But it wasnt that simple Because by the time I got out of that unit I was not functional at all I could hardly see five feet in front of myself I shuffled when I walked I was bowed over I rarely bathed I sometimes didnt shave It was dreadful And it was clear  not to me because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore  that I would need longterm hospitalization in that awful place called a mental hospital So I was admitted in  in the spring of  to the Institute of Living which used to be called the Hartford Retreat It was founded in the eighteenth century the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of Connecticut other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time And they tried everything they had They tried the usual psychotherapy They tried every medication available in those days And they did have Tofranil and other things  Mellaril who knows what Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things And finally because I was well known in Connecticut they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff All the senior staff got together and I later found out what happened They put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world who by that time had become so overwhelmed not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy but with obsessional thinking obsessional thinking about coincidences And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them just got me dreadfully upset  all kinds of ritualistic observances just awful awful stuff Remember when you were a kid and you had to step on every line Well I was a grown man who had all of these rituals and it got so there was a throbbing there was a ferocious fear in my head Youve seen this painting by Edvard Munch The Scream Every moment was a scream It was impossible So they decided there was no therapy there was no treatment But there was one treatment which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early s and you can imagine what it was It was prefrontal lobotomy So they decided  I didnt know this again I found this out later  that the only thing that could be done was for this yearold man to have a prefrontal lobotomy Well as in all hospitals there was a resident assigned to my case He was  years old and he would meet with me two or three times a week And of course I had been there what three or four months at the time And he asked to meet with the senior staff and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place They thought he had a really extraordinary future And he dug in his heels and said No I know this man better than any of you I have met with him over and over again Youve just seen him from time to time Youve read reports and so forth I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it And you know of course whatll happen if you do a prefrontal lobotomy Any of the results along the spectrum from pretty bad to terrible terrible terrible is going to happen If he does the best he can he will have no further obsessions probably no depression but his affect will be dulled he will never go back to surgery he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children his life will be changed If he has the usual result he will end up like One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest And you know about that just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life Well he said Cant we try a course of electroshock therapy And you know why they agreed They agreed to humor him They just thought Well well give a course of  And so well lose a little time Big deal It doesnt make any difference So they gave the course of  and the first  the usual course incidentally was six to eight and still is six to eight Plugged me into the wires put me to sleep gave me the muscle relaxant Six didnt work Seven didnt work Eight didnt work At nine I noticed  and its wonderful that I could notice anything  I noticed a change And at  I noticed a real change And he went back to them and they agreed to do another  Again not a single one of them  I think there are about seven or eight of them  thought this would do any good They thought this was a temporary change But lo and behold by  by  there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt By  and  I was sleeping through the night And by  I had the sense I really had the sense that I could overcome this that I was now strong enough that by an act of will I could blow the obsessional thinking away I could blow the depression away And Ive never forgotten  I never will forget  standing in the kitchen of the unit it was a Sunday morning in January of  standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking Ive got the strength now to do this It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and I could think clearly But I need a formula I need some thing to say to myself when I begin thinking obsessionally obsessively Well the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room will remember Ruddigore and they will remember Mad Margaret and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd And she used to go nuts every five minutes or so in the play and he said to her We must have a word to bring you back to reality and the word my dear will be Basingstoke So every time she got a little nuts he would say Basingstoke And she would say Basingstoke it is And she would be fine for a little while Well you know Im from the Bronx I cant say Basingstoke But I had something better And it was very simple It was Ah fuck it Laughter Much better than Basingstoke at least for me And it worked  my God it worked Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally  again once more after  shock treatments  I would say Ah fuck it And things got better and better and within three or four months I was discharged from that hospital and I joined a group of surgeons where I could work with other people in the community not in New Haven but fairly close by I stayed there for three years At the end of three years I went back to New Haven had remarried by that time I brought my wife with me actually to make sure I could get through this My children came back to live with us We had two more children after that Resuscitated the career even better than it had been before Went right back into the university and began to write books Well you know its been a wonderful life Its been as I said close to  years I stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a fulltime writer as many people know But its been very exciting Its been very happy Every once in a while I have to say Ah fuck it Every once in a while I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional So Im not free of all of this But its worked Its always worked Why have I chosen after never ever talking about this to talk about it now Well those of you who know some of these books know that one is about death and dying one is about the human body and the human spirit one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds and they have always to do with my own personal experiences One might think reading these books  and Ive gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this  that based on my lifes history as Ive portrayed in the books my early lifes history I am someone who has overcome adversity That I am someone who has drunk drank drunk of the bitter dregs of neardisaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened I really have it figured out so that I can advise people about death and dying so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit And Ive always felt guilty about that Ive always felt that somehow I was an impostor because my readers dont know what I have just told you Its known by some people in New Haven obviously but it is not generally known So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today is to  frankly selfishly  unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books But more importantly I think is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under  and there are many of course who are well over  For people under  and it looks to me like almost all of you  I would say all of you  are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent and exciting career anything can happen to you Things change Accidents happen Something from childhood comes back to haunt you You can be thrown off the track I hope it happens to none of you but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you To those to whom it doesnt happen there will be adversities If I with the bleakness of spirit with no spirit that I had in the s and no possibility of recovery as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought if I can find my way back from this believe me anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives And for those who are older who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this but who have lived through difficult times perhaps where they lost everything as I did and started out all over again some of these things will seem very familiar There is recovery There is redemption And there is resurrection There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery but it actually happens And it happens a lot Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme outside of specifically religious ones is the one about the phoenix the ancient story of the phoenix who every  years resurrects itself from its own ashes to go on to live a life that is even more beautiful than it was before Richard thanks very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

190,I live and work from Tokyo Japan And I specialize in human behavioral research and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future And you know to be honest Ive been doing this for seven years and I havent got a clue what the future is going to be like But Ive got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there This is my office Its out there Its not in the lab and its increasingly in places like India China Brazil Africa We live on a planet   billion people About three billion people by the end of this year will have cellular connectivity And itll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that And I mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about And thats kind of where I see what my job is and what our teams job is Our research often starts with a very simple question So Ill give you an example What do you carry If you think of everything in your life that you own when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you When youre looking around what do you consider Of that stuff what do you carry And of that stuff what do you actually use So this is interesting to us because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value And to put it really bluntly you know people are willing to pay for stuff that has value right So Ive probably done about five years research looking at what people carry I go in peoples bags I look in peoples pockets purses I go in their homes And we do this worldwide and we follow them around town with video cameras Its kind of like stalking with permission And we do all this  and to go back to the original question what do people carry And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff OK thats fair enough But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are  across cultures and across gender and across contexts  most people will say keys money and if they own one a mobile phone And Im not saying this is a good thing but this is a thing right I mean I couldnt take your phones off you if I wanted to Youd probably kick me out or something OK it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask But really the question is why Right So why are these things so important in our lives And it turns out from our research that it boils down to survival  survival for us and survival for our loved ones So keys provide an access to shelter and warmth  transport as well in the US increasingly Money is useful for buying food sustenance among all its other uses And a mobile phone it turns out is a great recovery tool If you prefer this kind of Maslows hierarchy of needs those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslows hierarchy of needs Yes they do a whole bunch of other stuff but theyre very good at this And in particular its the mobile phones ability to allow people to transcend space and time And what I mean by that is you know you can transcend space by simply making a voice call right And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience and someone else can pick it up at their convenience And this is fairly universally appreciated it turns out which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected And they value that connectivity But actually you can do this kind of stuff with PCs And you can do them with phone kiosks And the mobile phone in addition is both personal  and so it also gives you a degree of privacy  and its convenient You dont need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right However for these things to help us survive it depends on them being carried But  and its a pretty big but  we forget Were human thats what we do Its one of our features I think quite a nice feature So we forget but were also adaptable and we adapt to situations around us pretty well And so we have these strategies to remember and one of them was mentioned yesterday And its quite simply the point of reflection And thats that moment when youre walking out of a space and you turn around and quite often you tap your pockets Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets And you turn around and you look back into the space and some people talk aloud And pretty much everyone does it at some point OK the next thing is  most of you if you have a stable home life and what I mean is that you dont travel all the time and always in hotels but most people have what we call a center of gravity And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects And these things dont stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there Its where you expect to find stuff And in fact when youre turning around and youre looking inside the house and youre looking for this stuff this is where you look first right OK so when we did this research we found the absolutely  percent guaranteed way to never forget anything ever ever again And that is quite simply to have nothing to remember OK now that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie right But is in fact about the art of delegation And from a design perspective its about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people And it turns out delegation  if you want it to be  can be the solution for pretty much everything apart from things like bodily functions going to the toilet You cant ask someone to do that on your behalf And apart from things like entertainment you wouldnt pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf or at least not yet Maybe sometime in the future we will So let me give you an example of delegation in practice right So this is  probably the thing Im most passionate about is the research that weve been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate So the UN estimated  this is  figures  that there are almost  million people who cant read and write worldwide So weve been conducting a lot of research And one of the things we were looking at is  if you cant read and write if you want to communicate over distances you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with It could be a phone number it could be an email address it could be a postal address Simple question if you cant read and write how do you manage your contact information And the fact is that millions of people do it Just from a design perspective we didnt really understand how they did it and so thats just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation So they delegate that part of the task process to other people the stuff that they cant do themselves Let me give you another example of delegation This ones a little bit more sophisticated and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices use those devices Sente is a word in Uganda that means money It has a second meaning which is to send money as airtime OK And it works like this So lets say June youre in a village rural village Im in Kampala and Im the wage earner Im sending money back and it works like this So in your village theres one person in the village with a phone and thats the phone kiosk operator And its quite likely that theyd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk So what I do is I buy a prepaid card like this And instead of using that money to top up my own phone I call up the local village operator And I read out that number to them and they use it to top up their phone So theyre topping up the value from Kampala and its now being topped up in the village You take a  or  percent commission and then you  the kiosk operator takes  or  percent commission and passes the rest over to you in cash OK theres two things I like about this So the first is it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone  anyone who has a mobile phone  essentially into an ATM machine It brings rudimentary banking services to places where theres no banking infrastructure And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure they wouldnt necessarily be considered viable customers because theyre not wealthy enough to have bank accounts Theres a second thing I like about this And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this OK And yes there are things like Grameen Bank and microlending But the difference between this and that is theres no central authority trying to control this This is just streetup innovation So it turns out the street is a neverending source of inspiration for us And OK if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier Theyll give you a new one Theyll probably give you three new ones right I mean thats buy three get one free That kind of thing If you go on the streets of India and China you see this kind of stuff And this is where they take the stuff that breaks and they fix it and they put it back into circulation This is from a workbench in Jilin City in China and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together They reverseengineer manuals This is a kind of hackers manual and its written in Chinese and English They also write them in Hindi You can subscribe to these There are training institutes where theyre churning out people for fixing these things as well But what I like about this is it boils down to someone on the street with a small flat surface a screwdriver a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads  because they often get dust on the contact heads  and knowledge And its all about the social network of the knowledge floating around And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff and build stuff and potentially distribute stuff It challenges the norms OK for me the street just raises so many different questions Like this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes And I know what youre asking  did I test it Im not going to answer that OK But I look at something like this and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process And we look at this and we think well how does that apply for example for the design of  the lessons from this  apply to the design of online services future services in these markets This is a pair of underpants from  Laughter  from Tibet And I look at something like this and honestly you know why would someone design underpants with a pocket right And I look at something like this and it makes me question if we were to take all the functionality in things like this and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network how would we prioritize where to put stuff And yes this is quite trivial but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda This doesnt have house numbers This has phone numbers So what does it mean when peoples identity is mobile When those extra three billion peoples identity is mobile it isnt fixed Your notion of identity is outofdate already OK for those extra three billion people This is how its shifting And then I go to this picture here which is the one that I started with And this is from Delhi Its from a study we did into illiteracy and its a guy in a teashop You can see the chai being poured in the background And hes a you know incredibly poor teashop worker on the lowest rungs in the society And he somehow has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong And its not necessarily the same values but some kind of values of Livestrong to actually go out and purchase them and actually display them For me this kind of personifies this connected world where everything is intertwined and the dots are  its all about the dots joining together OK the title of this presentation is Connections and Consequences and its really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what its going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner right When everyones connected And there are four things So the first thing is the immediacy of ideas the speed at which ideas go around And I know TED is about big ideas but actually the benchmark for a big idea is changing If you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet thats the first thing The second thing is the immediacy of objects And what I mean by that is as these become smaller as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater  things like banking identity  these things quite simply move very quickly around the world And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid in a way that we just totally cannot conceive when you get it to  billion and the growth in the worlds population The next thing is that however we design this stuff  carefully design this stuff  the street will take it and will figure out ways to innovate as long as it meets base needs  the ability to transcend space and time for example And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate In ways that despite our resources they can do it better than us Thats my feeling And if were smart well look at this stuff thats going on and well figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design And the last thing is that  actually the direction of the conversation With another three billion people connected they want to be part of the conversation And I think our relevance and TEDs relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen essentially And we need to learn how to listen So thank you very very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

191,"So I guess it is a result
of globalization that you can find CocaCola tins
on top of Everest and a Buddhist monk in Monterey And so I just came
two days ago from the Himalayas to your kind invitation So I would like to invite you also
for a while to the Himalayas themselves And to show the place
where meditators like me who began with being a molecular biologist
in Pasteur Institute and found their way to the mountains So these are a few images
I was lucky to take and be there Theres Mount Kailash
in Eastern Tibet  wonderful setting This is from Marlboro country This is a turquoise lake A meditator This is the hottest day of the year
somewhere in Eastern Tibet on August  And the night before we camped
and my Tibetan friends said We are going to sleep outside And I said Why We have
enough space in the tent They said Yes but its summertime So now we are going
to speak of happiness As a Frenchman I must say that there are
a lot of French intellectuals that think happiness
is not at all interesting I just wrote an essay on happiness
and there was a controversy And someone wrote an article saying Dont impose on us
the dirty work of happiness We dont care about being happy
We need to live with passion We like the ups and downs of life We like our suffering because its so good
when it ceases for a while This is what I see from the balcony
of my hermitage in the Himalayas Its about two meters by three
and you are all welcome any time Now lets come
to happiness or wellbeing And first of all you know
despite what the French intellectuals say it seems that no one wakes up
in the morning thinking May I suffer the whole day Which means that somehow
consciously or not directly or indirectly
in the short or the long term whatever we do whatever we hope
whatever we dream  somehow is related to a deep profound
desire for wellbeing or happiness As Pascal said
even the one who hangs himself somehow is looking
for cessation of suffering He finds no other way But then if you look
in the literature East and West you can find incredible diversity
of definition of happiness Some people say I only believed
in remembering the past imagining the future never the present Some people say happiness is right now its the quality of the freshness
of the present moment And that led Henri Bergson
the French philosopher to say All the great thinkers of humanity
have left happiness in the vague so that each of them
could define their own terms Well that would be fine if it was just
a secondary preoccupation in life But now if it is something
that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life then we better know what it is
have some clearer idea And probably the fact
that we dont know that is why so often although we seek happiness
it seems we turn our back to it Although we want to avoid suffering it seems we are running
somewhat towards it And that can also come
from some kind of confusions One of the most common ones
is happiness and pleasure But if you look at
the characteristics of those two pleasure is contingent upon time
upon its object upon the place It is something that  changes of nature Beautiful chocolate cake
first serving is delicious second one not so much
then we feel disgust Thats the nature of things We get tired I used to be a fan of Bach I used to play it on the guitar you know I can hear it two three five times If I had to hear it  hours
nonstop it might be very tiring If you are feeling very cold
you come near a fire its so wonderful After some moments
you just go a little back and then it starts burning It sort of uses itself
as you experience it And also again it can 
also its something that you  it is not something
that is radiating outside Like you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you
can be suffering a lot Now what then will be happiness And happiness of course is such
a vague word so lets say wellbeing And so I think the best definition
according to the Buddhist view is that wellbeing is not just
a mere pleasurable sensation It is a deep sense
of serenity and fulfillment A state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states and all the joys and sorrows
that can come ones way For you that might be surprising Can we have this kind of wellbeing
while being sad In a way why not Because we are speaking
of a different level Look at the waves coming near the shore When you are at the bottom
of the wave you hit the bottom You hit the solid rock When you are surfing on the top
you are all elated So you go from elation
to depression  theres no depth Now if you look at the high sea there might be beautiful
calm ocean like a mirror There might be storms but the depth of the ocean
is still there unchanged So now how is that It can only be a state of being
not just a fleeting emotion sensation Even joy  that can be
the spring of happiness But theres also wicked joy
you can rejoice in someones suffering So how do we proceed
in our quest for happiness Very often we look outside We think that if we could gather
this and that all the conditions something that we say
Everything to be happy  to have everything to be happy That very sentence already reveals
the doom destruction of happiness To have everything If we miss something it collapses And also when things go wrong
we try to fix the outside so much but our control
of the outer world is limited temporary and often illusory So now look at inner conditions Arent they stronger Isnt it the mind that translates the outer condition
into happiness and suffering And isnt that stronger We know by experience that we can be
what we call a little paradise and yet be completely unhappy within The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal and there was a lot of construction
going on everywhere So one evening he said
Look you are doing all these things but isnt it nice also
to build something within And he said Without that 
even if you get a hightech flat on the th floor of a supermodern
and comfortable building if you are deeply unhappy within all you are going to look for
is a window from which to jump So now at the opposite we know a lot of people who
in very difficult circumstances manage to keep serenity inner strength
inner freedom confidence So now if the inner conditions
are stronger  of course the outer
conditions do influence and its wonderful to live
longer healthier to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom Its highly desirable However this is not enough Those are just auxiliary help conditions The experience that translates
everything is within the mind So then when we ask oneself how to nurture
the condition for happiness the inner conditions and which are those
which will undermine happiness So then this just needs
to have some experience We have to know from ourselves
there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing
to this wellbeing what the Greeks called
eudaimonia flourishing There are some which are adverse
to this wellbeing And so if we look
from our own experience anger hatred jealousy arrogance obsessive desire strong grasping they dont leave us in such a good state
after we have experienced it And also they are detrimental
to others happiness So we may consider that the more
those are invading our mind and like a chain reaction the more we feel miserable
we feel tormented At the opposite
everyone knows deep within that an act of selfless generosity if from the distance without anyone
knowing anything about it we could save a childs life
make someone happy We dont need the recognition
We dont need any gratitude Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation
with our deep nature And we would like to be
like that all the time So is that possible to change our way of being
to transform ones mind Arent those negative emotions
or destructive emotions inherent to the nature of mind Is change possible in our emotions
in our traits in our moods For that we have to ask
what is the nature of mind And if we look from
the experiential point of view there is a primary
quality of consciousness thats just the mere fact
to be cognitive to be aware Consciousness is like a mirror
that allows all images to rise on it You can have ugly faces
beautiful faces in the mirror The mirror allows that
but the mirror is not tainted is not modified
is not altered by those images Likewise behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness
pure awareness This is the nature It cannot be tainted intrinsically
with hatred or jealousy because then if it was always there  like a dye that would permeate
the whole cloth  then it would be found
all the time somewhere We know were not always angry
always jealous always generous So because the basic
fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality
that differentiates it from a stone there is a possibility for change
because all emotions are fleeting That is the ground for mind training Mind training is based on the idea
that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time You could go from love to hate But you cannot at the same time
toward the same object the same person want to harm
and want to do good You cannot in the same gesture
shake hand and give a blow So there are natural
antidotes to emotions that are destructive
to our inner wellbeing So thats the way to proceed Rejoicing compared to jealousy A kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense
grasping and obsession Benevolence loving kindness
against hatred But of course each emotion then
would need a particular antidote Another way is to try to find
a general antidote to all emotions and thats by looking at the very nature Usually when we feel annoyed
hatred or upset with someone or obsessed with something the mind goes again
and again to that object Each time it goes to the object it reinforces that obsession
or that annoyance So then its a selfperpetuating process So what we need to look for now is instead of looking outward
we look inward Look at anger itself It looks very menacing like a billowing monsoon cloud
or thunderstorm We think we could sit on the cloud but if you go there its just mist Likewise if you look
at the thought of anger it will vanish like frost
under the morning sun If you do this again
and again the propensity the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less
each time you dissolve it And at the end although it may rise it will just cross the mind like a bird crossing the sky
without leaving any track So this is the principal of mind training Now it takes time because it took time for all those faults
in our mind the tendencies to build up so it will take time
to unfold them as well But thats the only way to go Mind transformation 
that is the very meaning of meditation It means familiarization
with a new way of being new way of perceiving things which is more in adequation with reality with interdependence with the stream
and continuous transformation which our being and our consciousness is So the interface with cognitive science since we need to come to that
it was I suppose the subject of  we have to deal in such a short time 
with brain plasticity The brain was thought
to be more or less fixed All the nominal connections
in numbers and quantities were thought until the last  years to be more or less fixed
when we reached adult age Now recently it has been found
that it can change a lot A violinist as we heard who has done
 hours of violin practice some area that controls the movements
of fingers in the brain changes a lot increasing reinforcement
of the synaptic connections So can we do that with human qualities With loving kindness
with patience with openness So thats what those great
meditators have been doing Some of them who came to the labs like in Madison Wisconsin
or in Berkeley did  to  hours of meditation They do like three years retreat
where they do meditate  hours a day And then the rest of their life
they will do three or four hours a day They are real Olympic
champions of mind training This is the place where the meditators 
you can see its kind of inspiring Now here with  electrodes So what did they find Of course same thing The scientific embargo  if its ever submitted to Nature
hopefully it will be accepted It deals with the state of compassion
unconditional compassion We asked meditators who have
been doing that for years and years to put their mind in a state
where theres nothing but loving kindness total availability to sentient being Of course during the training
we do that with objects We think of people suffering
of people we love but at some point it can be
a state which is all pervading Here is the preliminary result which I can show
because its already been shown The bell curve shows  controls and what is being looked at is the difference between the right
and the left frontal lobe In very short people
who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed withdrawn They dont describe
a lot of positive affect Its the opposite on the left side more tendency to altruism to happiness to express
and curiosity and so forth So theres a basic line for people
And also it can be changed If you see a comic movie
you go off to the left side If you are happy about something
youll go more to the left side If you have a bout of depression
youll go to the right side Here the  is the full
standard deviation of a meditator
who meditated on compassion Its something that is totally out
of the bell curve So Ive no time to go
into all the different scientific results Hopefully they will come But they found that 
this is after three and a half hours in an fMRI its like coming out of a space ship Also it has been shown in other labs  for instance
Paul Ekmans labs in Berkeley  that some meditators are able also to control their emotional response
more than it could be thought Like the startle experiments for example If you sit a guy on a chair with all this apparatus
measuring your physiology and theres kind of a bomb that goes off its such an instinctive response that in  years they never saw
anyone who would not jump Some meditators
without trying to stop it but simply by being completely open thinking that that bang is just going
to be a small event like a shooting star they are able not to move at all So the whole point of that is not
sort of to make like a circus thing of showing exceptional
beings who can jump or whatever Its more to say
that mind training matters That this is not just a luxury This is not a supplementary
vitamin for the soul This is something
thats going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives We are ready to spend  years
achieving education We love to do jogging fitness We do all kinds of things
to remain beautiful Yet we spend surprisingly little time
taking care of what matters most  the way our mind functions  which again is the ultimate thing that determines
the quality of our experience Now compassion
is supposed to be put in action Thats what we try to do
in different places Just this one example
is worth a lot of work This lady with bone TB
left alone in a tent was going to die with her only daughter One year later how she is Different schools and clinics
weve been doing in Tibet And just I leave you
with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness
than I could ever say And jumping monks of Tibet Flying monks Thank you very much ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

192,Youve all seen lots of articles on climate change and heres yet another New York Times article just like every other darn one youve seen It says all the same stuff as all the other ones youve seen It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones youve seen Whats unusual about this one maybe is that its from  And the reason Im saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent That people have just sort of figured out about it and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution The fact is  uhuh Weve known about this problem for  years depending on how you count it We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so And weve accomplished close to zip This is the growth rate of CO in the atmosphere Youve seen this in various forms but maybe you havent seen this one What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating And that its accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line But in fact theyre growing faster Heres some data from actually just  days ago which shows this years minimum of the Arctic Sea ice and its the lowest by far And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel and politicians signing treaties  in fact you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative because its just consumed a lot of jet fuel Laughter No no In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing  our big economy  weve really hardly started Really were doing this basically Really not very much I dont want to depress you too much The problem is absolutely soluble and even soluble in a way thats reasonably cheap Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost of medical care Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP No this is really important to have this sense of scale So the problem is soluble and the way we should go about solving it is say dealing with electricity production which causes something like orso percent and rising of CO emissions And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation and wind power nuclear power and coal to CO capture which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment and work All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place Instead we spend our time talking But nevertheless thats not what Im going to talk to you about tonight What Im going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing And its this stuff in the middle here which is what you do if you dont stop the emissions quickly enough And you need to deal  somehow break the link between human actions that change climate and the climate change itself And thats particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change  and its important to be honest here there will be some benefits to climate change Oh yes I think its bad Ive spent my whole life working to stop it But one of the reasons its politically hard is there are winners and losers  not all losers But of course the natural world polar bears I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic They will completely lose And theres no adaption So this problem is absolutely soluble This geoengineering idea in its simplest form is basically the following You could put signed particles say sulfuric acid particles  sulfates  into the upper atmosphere the stratosphere where theyd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet And I know for certain that that will work Not that there arent side effects but I know for certain it will work And the reason is its been done And it was done not by us not by me but by nature Heres Mount Pinatubo in the early s That put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomblike cloud The result of that was pretty dramatic After that and some previous volcanoes we have you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heats up after these volcanoes But youll notice that in the upper bar which is the lower atmosphere and the surface it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit Theres no big mystery about it Theres lots of mystery in the details and theres some bad side effects like it partially destroys the ozone layer  and Ill get to that in a minute But it clearly cools down And one other thing its fast Its really important to say So much of the other things that we ought to do like slowing emissions are intrinsically slow because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions And not only that when you cut emissions you dont cut concentrations because concentrations the amount of CO in the air is the sum of emissions over time So you cant step on the brakes very quickly But if you do this its quick And there are times you might like to do something quick Another thing you might wonder about is does it work Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally And the answer seems to be yes So here are the graphs youve seen lots of times before Thats what the world looks like under one particular climate models view with twice the amount of CO in the air The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO and  percent less sunlight and youre back to the original climate And this graph from Ken Caldeira Its important to say came because Ken  at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mids  Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said Geoengineering wont work And to the person who was promoting it said The atmospheres much more complicated Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldnt do a very good compensation Ken went and ran his models and found that it did This topic is also old That report that landed on President Johnsons desk when I was two years old   That report in fact which had all the modern climate science  the only thing they talked about doing was geoengineering It didnt even talk about cutting emissions which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem Im not saying we shouldnt cut emissions We should but it made exactly this point So in a sense theres not much new The one new thing is this essay So I should say I guess that since the time of that original President Johnson report and the various reports of the US National Academy      people always talked about this idea Not as something that was foolproof but as an idea to think about But when climate became politically a hot topic  if I may make the pun  in the last  years this became so unPC we couldnt talk about it It just sunk below the surface We werent allowed to speak about it But in the last year Paul Crutzen published this essay saying roughly whats all been said before that maybe given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts we should think about things like this He said roughly whats been said before The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this even though there will be some ozone impacts And in fact he had some ideas to make them go away There was all sorts of press coverage all over the world going right down to Dr Strangelove Saves the Earth from the Economist And that got me thinking Ive worked on this topic on and off but not so much technically And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night And I thought about this childs toy  hence the title of my talk  and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin round in the childs radiometer to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly The other problem is theyre right in the ozone layer and Id prefer them above the ozone layer And it turns out I woke up the next morning and I started to calculate this It was very hard to calculate from first principles I was stumped But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere about  kilometers up that already have this effect Ill tell you very quickly how the effect works There are a lot of fun complexities that Id love to spend the whole evening on but I wont But lets say you have sunlight hitting some particle and its unevenly heated So the side facing the sun is warmer the side away cooler Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because its warm And so you see a net force away from the sun Thats called the photophoretic force There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit And of course we may be wrong  this hasnt all been peer reviewed were in the middle of thinking about it  but so far it seems good But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes  much longer than before  because theyre levitated We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere in principle solving the ozone problem Im sure there will be other problems that arise Finally we could make the particles migrate to over the poles so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet where we live and do the maximum job of what we might need to do which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency if you like This is a new idea thats crept up that may be essentially a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right I think its almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this its amazing how we can affect the planet The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage This improved science and engineering will whether we like it or not give us more and more leverage to affect the planet to control the planet to give us weather and climate control  not because we plan it not because we want it just because science delivers it to us bit by bit with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it Now suppose that space aliens arrived Maybe theyre going to land at the UN headquarters down the road here or maybe theyll pick a smarter spot  but suppose they arrive and they give you a box And the box has two knobs One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO concentrations You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs We have no global governance And different people will have different places they want it set Now I dont think thats going to happen Its not very likely But were building that box The scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece in their labs Even when theyre doing it for other reasons Even when theyre thinking theyre just working on protecting the environment They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it  I do not  but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously Because sooner or later well be confronted with decisions about this and its better if we think hard about it even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it Ill give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this We need a broader debate A debate that involves musicians scientists philosophers writers who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are So heres one way to think about it which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because its cheaper I guess the thing I havent said about this is it is absurdly cheap Its conceivable that say using the sulfates method or this method Ive come up with you could create an ice age at a cost of  percent of GDP Its very cheap We have a lot of leverage Its not a good idea but its just important Laughter Ill tell you how big the lever is the lever is that big And that calculation isnt much in dispute You might argue about the sanity of it but the leverage is real Laughter So because of this we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions and just as the concentrations go up we can increase the amount of geoengineering I dont think anybody takes that seriously Because under this scenario we walk further and further away from the current climate We have all sorts of other problems like ocean acidification that come from CO in the atmosphere anyway Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this But heres a case which is harder to reject Lets say that we dont do geoengineering we do what we ought to do which is get serious about cutting emissions But we dont really know how quickly we have to cut them Theres a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much So lets say that we work hard and we actually dont just tap the brakes but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations And maybe someday  like  October   we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side And we have global celebrations and weve actually started to  you know weve seen the worst of it But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next  years and remove some of the biggest cities from the map Thats an absolutely possible scenario We might decide at that point that even though geoengineering was uncertain and morally unhappy that its a lot better than not geoengineering And thats a very different way to look at the problem Its using this as risk control not instead of action Its saying that you do some geoengineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off not that youd use it as a substitute for action But there is a problem with that view And the problem is the following knowledge that geoengineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today This is what economists call a moral hazard And thats one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about and in general I think its the underlying reason that its been politically unacceptable to talk about this But you dont make good policy by hiding things in a drawer Ill leave you with three questions and then one final quote Should we do serious research on this topic Should we have a national research program that looks at this Not just at how you would do it better but also what all the risks and downsides of it are Right now you have a few enthusiasts talking about it some in a positive side some in a negative side  but thats a dangerous state to be in because theres very little depth of knowledge on this topic A very small amount of money would get us some Many of us  maybe now me  think we should do that But I have a lot of reservations My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem and I dont really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard I think there is a serious problem as you talk about this people begin to think they dont need to work so hard to cut emissions Another thing is maybe we need a treaty A treaty that decides who gets to do this Right now we may think of a big rich country like the US doing this But it might well be that in fact if China wakes up in  and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this and they may just decide theyd really rather have a geoengineered world than a nongeoengineered world And well have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision So heres one last thought which was said much much better  years ago in the US National Academy report than I can say today And I think it really summarizes where we are here That the CO problem the climate problem that weve heard about is driving lots of things  innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions  but also I think inevitably it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control whether we like it or not And its time to begin thinking about it even if the reason were thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldnt do it Thank you very much

193,What is bioenergy Bioenergy is not ethanol Bioenergy isnt global warming Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive Bioenergy is oil Its gas Its coal And part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geospatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it And to do that you really have to look first at agriculture So weve been planting stuff for  years And in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture is youve got to deal with pests youve got to deal with all types of awful things youve got to cultivate stuff In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate then youre going to be able to spread beyond the Nile Youre going to be able to power stuff so irrigation makes a difference Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it as opposed to where the rivers flood You start getting this organic agriculture you start putting machinery onto this stuff Machinery with a whole bunch of water leads to very largescale agriculture You put together machines and water and you get landscapes that look like this And then you get sales that look like this Its brute force So what youve been doing in agriculture is you start out with something thats a reasonably natural system You start taming that natural system You put a lot of force behind that natural system You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides  Laughter  behind that natural system and you end up with systems that look like this And its all brute force And thats the way weve been approaching energy So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system thats based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology And you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me This is a guy called Norman Borlaug He won the Nobel Prize Hes got the Congressional Medal of Honor He deserves all of this stuff And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds He did this in Mexico The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution That is something that a lot of people have criticized But of course those are people who dont realize that China and India instead of having huge amounts of starving people are exporting grains And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research which was Mexico didnt adopt this technology ignored this technology talked about why this technology should be thought about but not really applied And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesnt apply technology that was discovered in Mexico And in fact hasnt recognized this man to the point where there arent statues of this man all over Mexico There are in China and India And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies Now its not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world Its that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does if you understand biology What happened in agriculture Well if you take agriculture over a century agriculture in about  would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier Yeah the plows look different The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules but the farmer would have understood this is what the guys doing this is why hes doing it this is where hes going What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and thats where you get your productivity increases And as you do that stuff heres what happens to productivity Basically you go from  hours to produce  bushels to  to  to five Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times  to  whereas the rest of the economy increased about  times This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person The effect of this of course is its not just amber waves of grain it is mountains of stuff And  percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced This would be a good outcome for energy And of course by now youre probably saying to yourself Self I thought I came to a talk about energy and heres this guy talking about biology So wheres the link between these two things One of the ironies of this whole system is were discussing what to do about a system that we dont understand We dont even know what oil is We dont know where oil comes from I mean literally its still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from The best assumption and one of the best guesses in this stuff is that this stuff comes out of this stuff that these things absorb sunlight rot under pressure for millions of years and you get these black rivers Now the interesting thing about that thesis  if that thesis turns out to be true  is that oil and all hydrocarbons turned out to be concentrated sunlight And if you think of bioenergy bioenergy isnt ethanol Bioenergy is taking the sun concentrating it in amoebas concentrating it in plants and maybe thats why you get these rainbows And as youre looking at this system if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight then bioenergy works in a different way And weve got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels Maybe thats one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas the types of wells that youre beginning to see dont look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots This is how you farm oil And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved we started with this brute force approach And then what did we learn Then we learned we had to go bigger And then whatd we learn Then we have to go even bigger And we are getting really destructive as were going out and farming this bioenergy These are the Athabasca tar sands and theres an enormous amount  first of mining the largest trucks in the world are working here and then youve got to pull out this black sludge which is basically oil that doesnt flow Its tied to the sand And then youve got to use a lot of steam to separate it which only works at todays oil prices Coal Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff It is probably plants except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure So you take something like this you burn it you put it under pressure and likely as not you get this Although again I stress we dont know Which is curious as we debate all this stuff But as you think of coal this is what burned wheat kernels look like Not entirely unlike coal And of course coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines you get gas When that gas blows up people die So youre producing a biogas out of coal in some mines but not in others Any place you see a differential therere some interesting questions Theres some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff But again coal Maybe the same stuff maybe the same system maybe bioenergy and youre applying exactly the same technology Heres your brute force approach Once you get through your brute force approach then you just rip off whole mountaintops And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions which are coalfired gas plants That is probably not the best use of bioenergy As you think of what are the alternatives to this system  its important to find alternatives because it turns out that the US is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves nor is China There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there and weve got to start thinking of them as biological energy because if we keep treating them as chemical energy or engineering energy were going to be in deep doodoo Gas is a similar issue Gas is also a biological product And as you think of gas well youre familiar with gas And heres a different way of mining coal This is called coal bed methane Why is this picture interesting Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another  the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up  may be because theres stuff eating that stuff and producing gas This is a wellknown phenomenon Laughter You eat certain things you produce a lot of gas It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process If that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off and it may not be to burn coal It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture That is what bioenergy is It is not ethanol It is not subsidies to a few companies It is not importing corn into Iowa because youve built so many of these ethanol plants It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force And in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff OK if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades you can get a really substantial increase like an eightfold increase in your output This is just the beginning stages of this stuff And as you think of biomaterials this guy  who did part of the sequencing of the human genome who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world  has been thinking about how you structure this And theres a series of smart people thinking about this And theyve been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics like a Cambria like Codon and what those companies are trying to do is to think of how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force Think of it in the following terms Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes Think of the cell as a hardware Think of the genes as a software And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable that can become energy that can become food that can become fiber that can become human beings that can become a whole series of things then youve got to shift your approach as to how youre going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading This is one of the gentle giants on the planet Hes one of the nicest human beings youve ever met His name is Hamilton Smith He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes  something called restriction enzymes He was at Hopkins when he did this and hes such a modest guy that the day he won his mother called him and said I didnt realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins Do you know he just won the Nobel Laughter I mean that was Mom but anyway this guy is just a class act You find him at the bench every single day working on a pipette and building stuff And one of the things this guy just built are these things What is this This is the first transplant of naked DNA where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species Thats one month old You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are were going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies Were going to start thinking about biology entering energy It is very expensive to process this stuff both in economic terms and in energy terms This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta These are sulfur blocks Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor  steam to separate this stuff  you also have to separate out the sulfur The difference between light crude and heavy crude  well its about  bucks a barrel Thats why youre building these pyramids of sulfur blocks And by the way the scale on these things is pretty large Now if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this you reduce the system and you really do start applying biological principles to energy This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear  and hopefully you wont build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault Laughter Just a thought But in the meantime for the next decade at least the name of the game is hydrocarbons And be that oil be that gas be that coal this is what were dealing with And before I make this talk too long heres whats happening in the current energy system  percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons That means  percent of the stuff were consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff And theres a role in here for conservation Theres a role in here for alternative stuff but weve also got to get that other portion right How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future And as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about twothirds of the oil today inside those wells So were spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there Which of course requires more energy to go out and get energy The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol It may even be a onetoone ratio on the energy input and the energy output That is a stupid way of managing this system Last point last graph One of the things that weve got to do is to stabilize oil prices This is what oil prices look like OK This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels or for wind or for something else and then guess what The oil price goes through the floor That company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back up So if I had one closing and modest suggestion lets set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States How do you do that Well lets put a tax on oil that is a nonrevenue tax and it basically says for the next  years the price of oil will be  whatever you want  bucks  bucks If the OPEC price falls below that we tax it If the OPEC price goes above that the tax goes away What does that do for entrepreneurs What does it do for companies It tells people if you can produce energy for less than  bucks a barrel or less than  bucks a barrel or less than  bucks a barrel  lets debate it  you will have a business But lets not put people through this cycle where it doesnt pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening Thank you ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

194,Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here Laughter Well be talking about them Now Im going try an experiment I dont do experiments normally Im a theorist But Im going see what happens if I press this button Sure enough OK I used to work in this field of elementary particles What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine What is it made of And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe and theyre very much connected with the history of the universe We know a lot about four forces There must be a lot more but those are at very very small distances and we havent really interacted with them very much yet The main thing I want to talk about is this that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory And why on earth could that be so Well heres an example from my own experience Its fairly dramatic actually to have this happen Three or four of us in  put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces this weak force And it was in disagreement with seven  seven count them seven experiments Experiments were all wrong And we published before knowing that because we figured it was so beautiful its gotta be right The experiments had to be wrong and they were Now our friend over there Albert Einstein used to pay very little attention when people said You know theres a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity DC Miller What about that And he would say Aw thatll go away Laughter Now why does stuff like that work Thats the question Now yeah what do we mean by beautiful Thats one thing Ill try to make that clear  partially clear Why should it work and is this something to do with human beings Ill let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer and that is it has nothing to do with human beings Somewhere in some other planet orbiting some very distant star maybe in a another galaxy there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are and are interested in science Its not impossible I think there probably are lots Very likely none is close enough to interact with us But they could be out there very easily And suppose they have you know very different sensory apparatus and so on They have seven tentacles and they have  little funnylooking compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel Would they really have different laws There are lots of people who believe that and I think it is utter baloney I think there are laws out there and we of course dont understand them at any given time very well  but we try And we try to get closer and closer And someday we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces what I call the fundamental law We may not even be terribly far from it But even if we dont run across it in our lifetimes we can still think there is one out there and were just trying to get closer and closer to it I think thats the main point to be made We express these things mathematically And when the mathematics is very simple  when in terms of some mathematical notation you can write the theory in a very brief space without a lot of complication  thats essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance Heres what I was saying about the laws Theyre really there Newton certainly believed that And he said here It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws The basic law lets say  heres an assumption The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles Now some people call that a theory of everything Thats wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical And I wont go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what its like and so on Youve heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway Laughter There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities Now sometimes those probabilities are near certainties And in a lot of familiar cases they of course are But other times theyre not and you have only probabilities for different outcomes So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law Its the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents or chance outcomes that are there in addition And the fundamental theory doesnt include those chance outcomes they are in addition So its not a theory of everything And in fact a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents and not just from the fundamental laws Now its often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies and then higher energies and then higher energies or short distances and then shorter distances and then still shorter distances and so on is like peeling the skin of an onion And we keep doing that and build more powerful machines accelerators for particles We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law Now what happens is that as we do that as we peel these skins of the onion and we get closer and closer to the underlying law we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one and with the next one We write them out mathematically and we see they use very similar mathematics They require very similar mathematics That is absolutely remarkable and that is a central feature of what Im trying to say today Newton called it  thats Newton by the way  that one This one is Albert Einstein Hi Al And anyway he said nature conformable to herself  personifying nature as a female And so what happens is that the new phenomena the new skins the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to resemble the slightly larger ones And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin And thats why the equations look so simple Because they use mathematics we already have A trivial example is this Newton found the law of gravity which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated Coulomb in France found the same law for electric charges Heres an example of this similarity You look at gravity you see a certain law Then you look at electricity Sure enough The same rule Its a very simple example There are lots of more sophisticated examples Symmetry is very important in this discussion You know what it means A circle for example is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle You rotate around the center of the circle the circle remains unchanged You take a sphere in three dimensions you rotate around the center of the sphere and all those rotations leave the sphere alone They are symmetries of the sphere So we say in general that theres a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon or its description unchanged Maxwells equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space Doesnt matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle it doesnt leave the  doesnt change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism Theres a new notation in the th century that expressed this and if you use that notation the equations get a lot simpler Then Einstein with his special theory of relativity looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwells equations which are called special relativity And those symmetries then make the equations even shorter and even prettier therefore Lets look You dont have to know what these things mean doesnt make any difference But you can just look at the form Laughter You can look at the form You see above at the top a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space x y and z Then using vector analysis you use rotational symmetry and you get this next set Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here showing that symmetry exhibits better and better The more and more symmetry you have the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory The last two the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields The next  second  equation says that there is no magnetism other than that The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument But for the moment thats the case Now here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of They should have heard of it but its a little tricky to explain in technical detail so I wont do it Ill just mention it Laughter But Chen Ning Yang called by us Frank Yang  Laughter  and Bob Mills put forward  years ago this generalization of Maxwells equations with a new symmetry A whole new symmetry Mathematics very similar but there was a whole new symmetry They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics  didnt It didnt by itself contribute to particle physics But then some of us generalized it further And then it did And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force So here we say again what we said before that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely concise way So here are the themes We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity Symmetry exhibits the simplicity And then there is selfsimilarity across the scales  in other words from one skin of the onion to another one Proximate selfsimilarity And that accounts for this phenomenon That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory Heres what Newton himself said Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today but in his day it wasnt taken for granted Theres the story which is not absolutely certain to be right but a lot of people told it Four sources told it That when they had the plague in Cambridge and he went down to his mothers farm  because the university was closed  he saw an apple fall from a tree or on his head or something And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon That was a big unification for those days although today we take it for granted Its the same theory of gravity So he said that this principle of nature consonance This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers I forbore to describe it in that book lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak   Thats what we all have to watch out for Laughter especially at this meeting   and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book Now who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around and so on Everybody knows that Its a property of gravitation Its not something in the human mind The human mind can of course appreciate it and enjoy it use it but its not  it doesnt stem from the human mind It stems from the character of gravity And thats true of all the things were talking about They are properties of the fundamental law The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin I say here that Newton did a lot of things that year gravity the laws of motion the calculus white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow And he could have written quite an essay on What I Did Over My Summer Vacation So we dont have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates They follow from the fundamental theory They are what we call emergent properties You dont need  you dont need something more to get something more Thats what emergence means Life can emerge from physics and chemistry plus a lot of accidents The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents It doesnt diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things plus accidents Thats a general rule and its critically important to realize that You dont need something more in order to get something more People keep asking that when they read my book The Quark and the Jaguar and they say Isnt there something more beyond what you have there Presumably they mean something supernatural Anyway there isnt Laughter You dont need something more to explain something more Thank you very much Applause

195,I want you to imagine that youre a student in my lab What I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design And so heres the challenge I want you to help me create a fully D dynamic parameterized contact model The translation of that is could you help me build a foot And it is a true challenge and I do want you to help me Of course in the challenge there is a prize Its not quite the TED Prize but it is an exclusive tshirt from our lab So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot Now if we want to design a foot what do we have to do We have to first know what a foot is If we go to the dictionary it says Its the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking Thats the traditional definition But if you wanted to really do research what do you have to do You have to go to the literature and look up whats known about feet So you go to the literature Laughter Maybe youre familiar with this literature The problem is there are many many feet How do you do this You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work And I want you to help me do that in this next clip As you see this clip look for principles and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works See any common themes Principles What would you do What experiments would you run Wow Applause Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot Its a design inspired by nature but its not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at but its a synthesis of the secrets of many many feet Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere They can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw  in the probability of contact the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present If you want to study how a foot works were going to have to simulate those surfaces or simulate that debris When we did that heres a new experiment that we did we put an animal and had it run  this grass spider  on a surface with  percent of the contact area removed But it didnt even slow down the animal Its still running at the human equivalent of  miles per hour Now how could it do that Well look more carefully When we slow it down  times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris The leg is acting as a foot And in fact the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot The foot is distributed along the whole leg You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot and you can remove its foot Im passing some cockroaches around Take a look at their feet Without a foot heres what it does It doesnt even slow down It can run the same speed without even that segment No problem for the cockroach  they can grow them back if you care How do they do it Look carefully this is slowed down  times and watch what its doing with the rest of its leg Its acting again as a distributed foot  very effective Now the question we had is how general is a distributed foot And the next behavior Ill show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it Journalists this is off the record its embargoed Take a look at what that is Thats a bipedal octopus thats disguised as a rolling coconut It was discovered by Christina Huffard and filmed by Sea Studios right here from Monterey Weve also described another species of bipedal octopus This one disguises itself as floating algae It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it cant be seen And look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there  truly extraordinary In  Escher made this drawing He thought he created an animal fantasy But we know that art imitates life and it turns out nature three million years ago evolved the next animal Its a shrimplike animal called the stomatopod and heres how it moves on the beaches of Panama it actually rolls and it can even roll uphill Its the ultimate distributed foot its whole body in this case is acting like its foot So if we want to then to our blueprint add the first important feature we want to add distributed foot contact Not just with the traditional foot but also the leg and even of the body Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots We biologically inspired this robot named RHex built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years RHexs foot started off to be quite simple then it got tuned over time and ultimately resulted in this half circle Why is that The video will show you Watch where the robot now contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain What youll see in fact is that its using that half circle leg as a distributed foot Watch it go over this You can see it here well on this debris Extraordinary No sensing all the control is built right into the tuned legs Really simple but beautiful Now you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain And my assistants going to help me here When you touched the cockroach leg  can you get the microphone for him When you touched the cockroach leg what did it feel like Did you notice something Boy Spiny Robert Full Its spiny right Its really spiny isnt it It sort of hurts Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if hed be brave enough to touch the cockroach Chris Anderson Did you touch it RF So if you look carefully at this what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago no one knew what they did They assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures We found that theyre for something else  heres a segment of that spine Theyre tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris but theyre stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface Now crabs dont miss footholds because they normally move on sand  until they come to our lab And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh because they dont have spines The crabs are missing spines so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain But of course we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spines We can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs as you see here and then we tested them Do we really understand that principle of tuning The answer is yes This is slowed down fold and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris Laughter Applause A little better than nature So to our blueprint we need to add tuned spines Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots Well heres RHex RHex has trouble on rails  on smooth rails as you see here So why not add a spine My colleagues did this at U Penn Dan Koditschek put some steel nails  very simple version  on the robot and heres RHex now going over those steel  those rails No problem How does it do it Lets slow it down and you can see the spines in action Watch the leg come around and youll see it grab on right there It couldnt do that before it would just slip and get stuck and tip over And watch again right there  successful Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesnt mean you can climb vertical surfaces This is really really difficult But look at this animal do it One of the ones Im passing around is climbing up this vertical surface thats a smooth metal plate Its extraordinary how fast it can do it  but if you slow it down you see something thats quite extraordinary Its a secret The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look  and doing actually terribly with respect to grabbing on the surface It looks in fact like its swimming up the surface We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid if you look at it The distributed foot actually is working more like a paddle The same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand Watch its feet Its actually functioning as a paddle even though its interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself Can you use this to make a better robot Martin Buehler did  whos now at Boston Dynamics  he took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex So heres RHex with paddles now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot For rough surfaces though animals add claws And you probably feel them if you grabbed it Did you touch it CA I did RF And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University one of my collaborators is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot And heres the simple version of a foot for a new robot that Ill show you in a bit So to our blueprint lets attach claws Now if we look at animals though to be really maneuverable in all surfaces the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws and spines and hairs and pads and glue and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things These are all from different insects Theres an ant crawling up a vertical surface Lets look at that ant This is the foot of an ant You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here This is when its foots in the air Watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich You see what happens That pad comes out And thats where the glue is Here from underneath is an ant foot and when the claws dont dig in that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything It just extrudes And this was a hard shot to get  I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings So its pretty tough to do This is what it looks like close up  heres the ant foot and theres the glue And we discovered this glue may be an interesting twophase mixture It certainly helps it to hold on So to our blueprint we stick on some sticky pads Now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here Now we have something better here The geckos a really great example of nanotechnology in nature These are its feet Theyre  almost look alien And the secret which they stick on with involves their hairy toes They can run up a surface at a meter per second take  steps in that one second  you can hardly see them If we slow it down they attach their feet at eight milliseconds and detach them in  milliseconds And when you watch how they detach it it is bizarre They peel away from the surface like youd peel away a piece of tape Very strange How do they stick If you look at their feet they have leaflike structures called linalae with millions of hairs And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible It has a hundred to a thousand split ends and thats the secret because it allows intimate contact The gecko has a billion of these nanometersized split ends And they dont stick by glue or they dont work like Velcro or they dont work with suction We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone So to our blueprint we split some hairs This has inspired the design of the first selfcleaning dry adhesive  the patent issued were happy to say And heres the simplest version in nature and heres my collaborator Ron Fearings attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane And heres the first attempt to have it work on some load Theres enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields You could think of a thousand possible uses Im sure Lots of people have and were excited about realizing this as a product We have imagined products for example this one we imagined a bioinspired BandAid where we took the glue off the BandAid We took some hairs from a molting gecko put three rolls of them on here and then made this BandAid This is an undergraduate volunteer  we have  undergraduates so we can choose among them  thats actually just a red pen mark But it makes an incredible BandAid Its aerated it can be peeled off easily it doesnt cause any irritation it works underwater I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiositybased research  we just wondered how they climbed up something  can lead to things that you could never imagine Its just an example of why we need to support curiositybased research Here you are pulling off the BandAid So weve redefined now what a foot is The question is can we use these secrets then to inspire the design of a better foot better than one that we see in nature Heres the new project were trying to create the first climbing searchandrescue robot  no suction or magnets  that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces I call the new robot RiSE for Robot in Scansorial Environment  thats a climbing environment  and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot And here is RiSE Its sixlegged and has a tail Here it is on a fence and a tree And here are RiSEs first steps on an incline You have the audio You can hear it go up And here it is coming up at you in its first steps up a wall Now its only using its simplest feet here so this is very new But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot Mark Cutkosky though is taking it a step further Hes the one able to build this shapedeposition manufactured feet and toes The next step is to make compliant toes and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives So the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right attempt to make that climb and ultimately put it on the robot And thats exactly what hes done Hes built in fact a climbing footbot inspired by nature And heres Cutkoskys and his amazing students design So these are tuned toes  there are six of them and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint So this is not using any suction any glue and it will ultimately when its attached to the robot  its as biologically inspired as the animal  hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface Here you see it next going up the side of a building at Stanford Its sped up  again its a foot climbing Its not the whole robot yet were working on it  now you can see how its attaching These tuned structures allow the spines friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging difficult surfaces And so they were able to get this thing  this is now sped up  times  can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor OK You can visualize this now its not impossible Its a very challenging task But more to come later To finish weve gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built Weve learned we should distribute control to smart parts Dont put it all in the brain but put some of the control in tuned feet legs and even body That nature uses hybrid solutions not a single solution to these problems and theyre integrated and beautifully robust And third we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make  potentially  something better than nature So theres a clear message whether you care about a fundamental basic research of really interesting bizarre wonderful animals or you want to build a searchandrescue robot that can help you in an earthquake or to save someone in a fire or you care about medicine we must preserve natures designs Otherwise these secrets will be lost forever Thank you

197,You will understand nothing with my type of English Its good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people I must tell you I am like that not very comfortable because usually in life I think my job is absolutely useless I mean I feel useless Now after Carolyn and all the other guys I feel like shit And definitively I dont know why I am here but  you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you You must sing I dont know Laughter So so because I have nothing to show nothing to say we shall try to speak about something else We can start if you want by understanding  its just to start its not interesting but  how I work When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known I mean yes lemon squeezer toilet brush toothpick beautiful toilet seats and why not  a toothbrush I dont try to design the toothbrush I dont try to say Oh that will be a beautiful object or something like that That doesnt interest me Because there is different types of design The one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the s who said what is ugly is a bad sale la laideur se vend mal which is terrible It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more its shit its obsolete its ridiculous I call that the cynical design After there is the narcissistic design its a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers Laughter After there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so ashamed to make this useless job who try to do it in another way and they try I try to not make the object for the object but for the result for the profit for the human being the person who will use it If we take the toothbrush  I dont think about the toothbrush I think What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth And to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth I must imagine Who owns this mouth What is the life of the owner of this mouth In what society does this guy live What civilization creates this society What animal species creates this civilization When I arrive  and I take one minute I am not so intelligent  when I arrive at the level of animal species that becomes real interesting Me I have strictly no power to change anything But when I come back I can understand why I shall not do it because today to not do it its more positive than do it or how I shall do it But to come back where I am at the animal species there is things to see There is things to see there is the big challenge The big challenge in front of us Because there is not a human production which exists outside of what I call the big image The big image is our story our poetry our romanticism Our poetry is our mutation our life We must remember and we can see that in any book of my son of  years old that life appears four billion years ago around  four billion point two Voice offstage Four point five Yes point five OK OK OK Laughter Im a designer thats all of Christmas gifts And before there was this soup called soupe primordiale this first soup  bloop bloop bloop  sort of dirty mud no life nothing So then  pshooshoo  lightning  pshoo  arrive  pshooshoo  makes life  bloop bloop  and that dies Some million years after  pshooshoo bloopbloop  ah wake up At the end finally that succeeds and life appears We was so so stupid The most stupid bacteria Even I think we copy our way to reproduce you know what I mean and something of  oh no forget it After we become a fish after we become a frog after we become a monkey after we become what we are today a supermonkey and the fun is the supermonkey we are today is at half of the story Can you imagine From that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an iPod four billion years And we know and especially Carolyn knows that when the sun will implode the earth will burn explode I dont know what and this is scheduled for four four billion years Yes she said something like that OK that means we are at half of the story Fantastic Its a beauty Can you imagine Its very symbolic Because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today And today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years And this territory is fantastic That is our poetry That is our beautiful story Its our romanticism Mutation We are mutants And if we dont deeply understand if we dont integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story Because every generation thinks we are the final one We have a way to look at Earth like that you know I am the man The final man You know we mutate during four billion years before but now because its me we stop Fin Laughter For the end for the eternity it is one with a red jacket Something like that I am not sure of that Laughter Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that There is so many things to do its so fresh And here is something nobody is obliged to be a genius but everybody is obliged to participate And to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of exercise a minimum of sport We can say that The first if you want  there is so many  but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision I can explain you I shall try If you walk like that its OK its OK you can walk but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole And you will fall and you will die Dangerous Thats why perhaps you will try to have this angle of vision OK I can see if I found something up up and they continue up up up I raise the angle of vision but its still very  selfish selfish egoiste  yes selfish You you survive Its OK If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go I see you oh my God you are here how are you I can help you I can design for you a new toothbrush new toilet brush something like that I live in society I live in community Its OK You start to be in the territory of intelligence we can say From this level the more you can raise this angle of view the more you will be important for the society The more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization The more you will rise to see far and high like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation That means intelligent people are in this angle That is intelligence From this to here that its genius Ptolemy Eratosthenes Einstein things like that Nobodys obliged to be a genius Its better but nobody Take care in this training to be a good mutant There is some danger there is some trap One trap the vertical Because at the vertical of us if you look like that Ah my God there is God Ah God God is a trap God is the answer when we dont know the answer That means when your brain is not enough big when you dont understand you go Ah its God its God Thats ridiculous Thats why  jump like that No dont jump Come back Because after there is another trap If you look like that you look to the past or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself Its called schizophrenia and you are dead also Thats why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will raise your angle of view Out more of the horizontal You are an intelligence Never forget  like that like that Its very very very important What what else we can say about that Why do that Its because we  if we look from far we see our line of evolution This line of evolution is clearly positive From far this line looks very smooth like that But if you take a lens like that this line is ack ack ack ack ack Like that Its made of light and shadow We can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria And its very important to know where we are Because some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle That means we can imagine  I dont say it was fantastic but in the s there was not too much war like that it was  we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized In this case people like me are acceptable We can say Its luxurious time We have time to think we have time to I dont know what speak about art and things like that Its OK We are in the light But sometimes like today we fall we fall so fast so fast to shadow we fall so fast to barbaria With many many many many face of barbaria Because its not the barbaria we have today its perhaps not the barbaria we think There is different type of barbaria Thats why we must adapt That means when barbaria is back forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful hotel forget design even  Im sorry to say  forget art Forget all that There is priority there is urgency You must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization Im sorry if thats not very English You must go back to fight to battle Thats why today Im so ashamed to make this job Thats why I am here to try to do it the best possible But I know that even I do it the best possible  thats why Im the best  its nothing Because its not the right time Thats why I say that I say that because I repeat nothing exist if its not in the good rhythym the rhythym of our beautiful dream of this civilization And because we must all work to finish this story Because the scenario of this civilization  about love progress and things like that  its OK but there is so many different other scenarios of other civilizations This scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of God We are God now We are Its almost done We have just to finish the story That is very very important And when you dont understand really whats happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that You go to the future back back back back like that And you can fall and its very dangerous No you must really understand that Because we have almost finished Ill repeat this story And the beauty of this in perhaps  years  years we can finish completely this civilization and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new romanticism With billions of people who have been born worked lived and died before us these people who have worked so much we have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many things We can say to our children OK done that was our story That passed Now you have a duty invent a new story Invent a new poetry The only rule is we have not to have any idea about the next story We give you white pages Invent We give you the best tools the best tools and now do it Thats why I continue to work even if its for toilet brush ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

198,I want to start my story in Germany in  with a mathematician named Georg Cantor And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process a recursive process So he starts out with one line and then two and then four and then  and so on And if he does this an infinite number of times which you can do in mathematics he ends up with an infinite number of lines each of which has an infinite number of points in it So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity And this blew his mind Literally He checked into a sanitarium Laughter And when he came out of the sanitarium he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself He was a very religious man He was a mathematician on a mission And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing A Swedish mathematician von Koch decided that instead of subtracting lines he would add them And so he came up with this beautiful curve And theres no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any seed shape we like And Ill rearrange this and Ill stick this somewhere  down there OK  and now upon iteration that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure So these all have the property of selfsimilarity the part looks like the whole Its the same pattern at many different scales Now mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down you measure a longer and longer length And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times as the ruler shrinks down to infinity the length goes to infinity This made no sense at all so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books They said these are pathological curves and we dont have to discuss them And that worked for a hundred years And then in  Benoit Mandelbrot a French mathematician realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals you get the shapes of nature You get the human lungs you get acacia trees you get ferns you get these beautiful natural forms If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet  go ahead and do that now   and relax your hand youll see a crinkle and then a wrinkle within the crinkle and a crinkle within the wrinkle Right Your body is covered with fractals The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes They were breathing those words with fractal lungs Its very ironic And Ill show you a little natural recursion here Again we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape So heres the second iteration and the third fourth and so on So nature has this selfsimilar structure Nature uses selforganizing systems Now in the s I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village you see fractals And I thought This is fabulous I wonder why And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals which is a great job if you can get it And so I finally got to this city and Id done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold  but when I got there I got to the palace of the chief and my French is not very good I said something like I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof But he was really cool about it and he took me up there and we talked about fractals And he said Oh yeah yeah We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle we know all about that And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here And as you go through the path you have to get more and more polite So theyre mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling its a conscious pattern It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal This is a village in southern Zambia The Baila built this village about  meters in diameter You have a huge ring The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back and then you have the chiefs ring here towards the back and then the chiefs immediate family in that ring So heres a little fractal model for it Heres one house with the sacred altar heres the house of houses the family enclosure with the humans here where the sacred altar would be and then heres the village as a whole  a ring of ring of rings with the chiefs extended family here the chiefs immediate family here and here theres a tiny village only this big Now you might wonder how can people fit in a tiny village only this big Thats because theyre spirit people Its the ancestors And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village right So its just like Georg Cantor said the recursion continues forever This is in the Mandara mountains near the Nigerian border in Cameroon Mokoulek I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect and I thought Wow What a beautiful fractal So I tried to come up with a seed shape which upon iteration would unfold into this thing I came up with this structure here Lets see first iteration second third fourth Now after I did the simulation I realized the whole village kind of spirals around just like this and heres that replicating line  a selfreplicating line that unfolds into the fractal Well I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at So when I got to the village I said Can you take me to the square building I think somethings going on there And they said Well we can take you there but you cant go inside because thats the sacred altar where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales So heres a Nankani village in Mali And you can see you go inside the family enclosure  you go inside and heres pots in the fireplace stacked recursively Heres calabashes that Issa was just showing us and theyre stacked recursively Now the tiniest calabash in here keeps the womans soul And when she dies they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity Once again infinity is important Now you might ask yourself three questions at this point Arent these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture And that was actually my original hypothesis When I first saw those African fractals I thought Wow so any indigenous group that doesnt have a state society that sort of hierarchy must have a kind of bottomup architecture But that turns out not to be true I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture only the African ones were fractal And if you think about it all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry You can see on the pottery and the baskets Heres an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins you can see its circular at the largest scale but its rectangular at the smaller scale right It is not the same pattern at two different scales Second you might ask Well Dr Eglash arent you ignoring the diversity of African cultures And three times the answer is no First of all I agree with Mudimbes wonderful book The Invention of Africa that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism and then oppositional movements No because a widely shared design practice doesnt necessarily give you a unity of culture  and it definitely is not in the DNA And finally the fractals have selfsimilarity  so theyre similar to themselves but theyre not necessarily similar to each other  you see very different uses for fractals Its a shared technology in Africa And finally well isnt this just intuition Its not really mathematical knowledge Africans cant possibly really be using fractal geometry right It wasnt invented until the s Well its true that some African fractals are as far as Im concerned just pure intuition So some of these things Id wander around the streets of Dakar asking people Whats the algorithm Whats the rule for making this and theyd say Well we just make it that way because it looks pretty stupid Laughter But sometimes thats not the case In some cases there would actually be algorithms and very sophisticated algorithms So in Manghetu sculpture youd see this recursive geometry In Ethiopian crosses you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape In Angola the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand and its what the German mathematician Euler called a graph we now call it an Eulerian path  you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice But they do it recursively and they do it with an agegrade system so the little kids learn this one and then the older kids learn this one then the next agegrade initiation you learn this one And with each iteration of that algorithm you learn the iterations of the myth You learn the next level of knowledge And finally all over Africa you see this board game Its called Owari in Ghana where I studied it its called Mancala here on the East Coast Bao in Kenya Sogo elsewhere Well you see selforganizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game And the folks in Ghana knew about these selforganizing patterns and would use them strategically So this is very conscious knowledge Heres a wonderful fractal Anywhere you go in the Sahel youll see this windscreen And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian all strictly linear But here in Africa youve got these nonlinear scaling fences So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako and I asked him How come youre making fractal fences Because nobody else is And his answer was very interesting He said Well if I lived in the jungle I would only use the long rows of straw because theyre very quick and theyre very cheap It doesnt take much time doesnt take much straw He said but wind and dust goes through pretty easily Now the tight rows up at the very top they really hold out the wind and dust But it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of straw because theyre really tight Now he said we know from experience that the farther up from the ground you go the stronger the wind blows Right Its just like a costbenefit analysis And I measured out the lengths of straw put it on a loglog plot got the scaling exponent and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry it was in a symbolic code and this was Bamana sand divination And the same divination system is found all over Africa You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast and often the symbols are very well preserved so each of these symbols has four bits  its a fourbit binary word  you draw these lines in the sand randomly and then you count off and if its an odd number you put down one stroke and if its an even number you put down two strokes And they did this very rapidly and I couldnt understand where they were getting  they only did the randomness four times  I couldnt understand where they were getting the other  symbols And they wouldnt tell me They said No no I cant tell you about this And I said Well look Ill pay you you can be my teacher and Ill come each day and pay you They said Its not a matter of money This is a religious matter And finally out of desperation I said Well let me explain Georg Cantor in  And I started explaining why I was there in Africa and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set And one of them said Come here I think I can help you out here And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest And of course I was only interested in the math so the whole time he kept shaking his head going You know I didnt learn it this way But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed buried in sand and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on And finally he revealed the truth of the matter And it turns out its a pseudorandom number generator using deterministic chaos When you have a fourbit symbol you then put it together with another one sideways So even plus odd gives you odd Odd plus even gives you odd Even plus even gives you even Odd plus odd gives you even Its addition modulo  just like in the parity bit check on your computer And then you take this symbol and you put it back in so its a selfgenerating diversity of symbols Theyre truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this Now because its a binary code you can actually implement this in hardware  what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical In the th century Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy divination through the earth This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in  Leibniz the German mathematician talked about geomancy in his dissertation called De Combinatoria And he said Well instead of using one stroke and two strokes lets use a one and a zero and we can count by powers of two Right Ones and zeros the binary code George Boole took Leibnizs binary code and created Boolean algebra and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer So all these little PDAs and laptops  every digital circuit in the world  started in Africa And I know Brian Eno says theres not enough Africa in computers but you know I dont think theres enough African history in Brian Eno Laughter Applause So let me end with just a few words about applications that weve found for this And you can go to our website the applets are all free they just run in the browser Anybody in the world can use them The National Science Foundations Broadening Participation in Computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools so hopefully in three years anybodyll be able to go on the Web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts Weve focused in the US on AfricanAmerican students as well as Native American and Latino Weve found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software So its really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage thats about mathematics that its not just about singing and dancing Weve started a pilot program in Ghana We got a small seed grant just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this were very excited about the future possibilities for that Weve also been working in design I didnt put his name up here  my colleague Kerry in Kenya has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village it doesnt quite fit Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture in which hes used some of these fractal structures And finally I just wanted to point out that this idea of selforganization as we heard earlier its in the brain Its in the  its in Googles search engine Actually the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the selforganizing properties of the web Its in ecological sustainability Its in the developmental power of entrepreneurship the ethical power of democracy Its also in some bad things Selforganization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast And if you dont think that capitalism which is selforganizing can have destructive effects you havent opened your eyes enough So we need to think about as was spoken earlier the traditional African methods for doing selforganization These are robust algorithms These are ways of doing selforganization  of doing entrepreneurship  that are gentle that are egalitarian So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust selforganizing algorithms Thank you

199,"Good morning ladies and gentlemen My name is Art Benjamin
and I am a mathemagician What that means is I combine
my loves of math and magic to do something I call mathemagics But before I get started I have
a quick question for the audience By any chance did anyone happen to bring with them
this morning a calculator Seriously if you have a calculator
with you raise your hand Raise your hand Did your hand go up Now bring it out bring it out
Anybody else I see I see one way in the back You sir thats three And anybody on this side here OK over there on the aisle Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage Lets give them a nice round of applause Thats right Now since I havent had the chance
to work with these calculators I need to make sure
that they are all working properly Would somebody get us started by giving us
a twodigit number please How about a twodigit number Audience  AB  And another twodigit number sir Audience  AB Multiply  times 
make sure you get  or the calculators are not working Do all of you get   Volunteer No AB  Lets give three of them
a nice round of applause there Would you like to try a more
standard calculator just in case OK great What Im going to try and do then  I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer Thats OK Ill give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator There is something called
the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself For instance five squared would be Audience  AB  The way we can
square on most calculators  let me demonstrate with this one  is by taking the number such as five hitting times and then equals and on most calculators
that will give you the square On some of these ancient RPN calculators youve got an x squared button on it will allow you to do
the calculation even faster What Im going to try and do
now is to square in my head four twodigit numbers faster than they can do
on their calculators even using the shortcut method What Ill use is the second row this time and Ill get four of you to each yell out a twodigit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second
the third and the fourth I will try and race you to the answer OK So quickly a twodigit number please Audience  Arthur Benjamin  squared OK Audience  AB  squared OK Audience  AB  squared OK and finally Audience  AB  squared Would you call out your answers please Volunteer 
AB  Volunteer 
AB  Volunteer 
AB  Volunteer  AB Thank you very much Let me try to take this one step further Im going to try to square
some threedigit numbers this time I wont even write these down  Ill just call them out
as theyre called out to me Anyone I point to call out
a threedigit number Anyone on our panel verify the answer Just give some indication if its right A threedigit number sir yes Audience  AB  squared is  AB Yes Good Another threedigit   another threedigit number sir Audience  AB  squared is   AB Yes OK another another
threedigit number sir Audience  AB  is   Yes One more threedigit number please Audience Oh  AB  is  thats a harder one Is that  Volunteer Yes AB Yes Oh one more one more
threedigit number please Audience   squared is  Volunteer Yes Thank you very much Applause ends Let me try to take this one step further Im going to try to square
a fourdigit number this time You can all take your time on this I will not beat you
to the answer on this one but I will try to get the answer right To make this a little bit more random
lets take the fourth row this time lets say one two three four If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine that will be the fourdigit
number that Ill square Nine Seven Five Eight  this will take me a little bit
of time so bear with me  million  Sighs  Volunteer Yes AB Thank you very much Applause ends Now I would attempt to square
a fivedigit number  and I can  but unfortunately
most calculators cannot Eightdigit capacity 
dont you hate that So since weve reached
the limits of our calculators  whats that Does yours go higher Volunteer I dont know AB Oh yours does Volunteer I can probably do it
AB Ill talk to you later In the meanwhile let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier Lets take the largest number
on the board here  Would you each enter
that on your calculator And instead of squaring it this time I want you to take
that number and multiply it by any threedigit number that you want but dont tell me
what youre multiplying by  just multiply it by any random
threedigit number So you should have as an answer either a sixdigit or probably
a sevendigit number How many digits do you have six or seven Seven and yours Seven Seven And uncertain Seven Is there any possible way
that I could know what sevendigit numbers you have Say No Good then I shall attempt
the impossible  or at least the improbable What Id like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits
any six of them in any order youd like One digit at a time I shall try and determine
the digit youve left out Starting with your sevendigit number call out any six of them please Volunteer       AB Did you leave out the number  Good OK thats one You have a sevendigit number
call out any six of them please Volunteer      I think I only heard five numbers
I  wait    did you leave out the number  Same as she did OK Youve got a sevendigit number  call out any six of them loud and clear Volunteer       I think you left out the number  AB Thats three The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 
 to the fourth power OK any six of them Really scramble them up this time please Volunteer       Did you leave out the number  And lets give all four of these people
a nice round of applause Thank you very much Applause ends For my next number  while I mentally recharge my batteries I have one more question for the audience By any chance does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on If you think you know
your birth day raise your hand Lets see starting with 
lets start with a gentleman first What year was it first of all Thats why I pick a gentleman first Audience   and the month November what rd  was that a Monday Audience Yes Good Somebody else I havent seen any womens hands up OK how about you what year  and the month October what Fifth  was that a Wednesday Yes Ill go way to the back
right now how about you Yell it out what year Audience   OK  and the month Audience February February what Sixth  was that a Friday
Audience Yes Good how about the person behind her Call out what year was it Audience 
AB  and the month Audience May
AB May what Seventh  would that be a Wednesday Audience Yes
AB Thank you very much Anybody here whod like to know
the day of the week they were born We can do it that way Of course I could just make up
an answer and you wouldnt know so I come prepared for that I brought with me a book of calendars It goes as far back into the past as 
because you never know I didnt mean to look at you sir 
you were just sitting there Anyway Chris you can help me
out here if you wouldnt mind This is a book of calendars Who wanted to know their birth day What year was it first of all Audience    turn to the calendar with  And what month Audience April
AB April what Audience th I believe that was a Sunday Can you confirm Chris Chris Anderson Yes AB Ill tell you what Chris as long as you have
that book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year
outside of the s either into the s
or way into the s  thatll be a much greater
challenge for me AB What year would you like
CA  AB  OK AB And what month CA June AB June what
CA Sixth AB Was that a Sunday CA It was
AB And it was cloudy Good thank you very much Applause ends But Id like to wrap things up now by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation There was a gentleman up here
who had a digit calculator Where is he would you stand up digit guy OK stand up for me just for a second so I can see where you are You have a digit calculator
sir as well OK what Im going to try
and do is to square in my head a fivedigit number requiring
a digit calculator But to make my job more interesting
for you as well as for me Im going to do this problem
thinking out loud So you can actually honestly hear whats going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size Now I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green I know as a magician were not supposed
to reveal our secrets but Im not too afraid that people are going to start
doing my show next week so  I think were OK So lets see lets take a different row of people
starting with you Ill get five digits
one two three four Oh I did this row already Lets do the row before you starting with you
one two three four five Call out a single digit  that will be the fivedigit number
that I will try to square go ahead Five Seven Six Eight Three   squared Yuck Let me explain to you
how Im going to attempt this problem Im going to break the problem
down into three parts Ill do  squared plus  squared plus  times  times two Add all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer Now let me recap Thank you While I explain something else   I know that you can use right While I do these calculations you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers
creep into the calculation Let me explain what that is This is a phonetic code a mnemonic device that I use that allows me to convert
numbers into words I store them as words and later on
retrieve them as numbers I know it sounds complicated its not I dont want you to think youre seeing
something out of Rain Man Theres definitely
a method to my madness  definitely definitely Sorry If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards you can talk to me then By the way one last instruction for my judges with the calculators  you know who you are  there is at least a  percent chance
that I will make a mistake here If I do dont tell me
what the mistake is just say youre close
or something like that and Ill try and figure out the answer  which could be pretty
entertaining in itself If however I am right whatever you do
dont keep it to yourself OK Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right because this is my big finish OK So without any more stalling here we go Ill start the problem
in the middle with  times   times  is  plus  is  thats  plus   plus  is   double that to get   becomes cookie fission cookie fission is  That seems right Ill go on
Cookie fission OK Next I do  squared
which is  so I can say three billion Take the  add that to cookie  oops but I see a carry coming    add that to cookie  plus  is  million  fission fission OK
finally we do  squared thats  times  plus  squared is  rev up if I need it rev up take the  add that to fission to get oh gee   Audience Yeah
AB Good Thank you very much I hope you enjoyed mathemagics Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

200,You know Im struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion these very moving demonstrations weve just seen HIV in Africa President Clinton last night And Id like to do a little collateral thinking if you will about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal Im a psychologist but rest assured I will not bring it to the scrotal There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help we do sometimes and we dont other times A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic Half of those students were given as a topic the parable of the Good Samaritan the man who stopped the stranger in  to help the stranger in need by the side of the road Half were given random Bible topics Then one by one they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon As they went from the first building to the second each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning clearly in need The question is Did they stop to help The more interesting question is Did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan Answer No not at all What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in  were they feeling they were late or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about And this is I think the predicament of our lives that we dont take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction Theres a new field in brain science social neuroscience This studies the circuitry in two peoples brains that activates while they interact And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help That is to say if we attend to the other person we automatically empathize we automatically feel with them There are these newly identified neurons mirror neurons that act like a neuro WiFi activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs We feel with automatically And if that person is in need if that person is suffering were automatically prepared to help At least thats the argument But then the question is Why dont we And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete selfabsorption to noticing to empathy and to compassion And the simple fact is if we are focused on ourselves if were preoccupied as we so often are throughout the day we dont really fully notice the other And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle I was doing my taxes the other day and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave and I had an epiphany it was  I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought boy my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit  that I felt good about myself Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic selffocus to altruistic joy to feeling good for the people that were being helped I think thats a motivator But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman who was in the singles scene And this woman says My brother is having trouble getting dates so hes trying speed dating I dont know if you know speed dating Women sit at tables and men go from table to table and theres a clock and a bell and at five minutes bingo the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up And this woman says My brothers never gotten a card and I know exactly why The moment he sits down he starts talking nonstop about himself he never asks about the woman And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times looking at the back stories of marriages  because theyre very interesting  and I came to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein And she said that when she was in the dating scene she had a simple test she put people to The test was from the moment they got together how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word you in it And apparently Epstein aced the test therefore the article Now this is a  its a little test I encourage you to try out at a party Here at TED there are great opportunities The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called The Human Moment about how to make real contact with a person at work And they said well the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry close your laptop end your daydream and pay full attention to the person There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person were with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone and all of a sudden we dont exist The word is pizzled its a combination of puzzled and pissed off I think its quite apt Its our empathy its our tuning in which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths I have a brotherinlaw whos an expert on horror and terror  he wrote the Annotated Dracula the Essential Frankenstein  he was trained as a Chaucer scholar but he was born in Transylvania and I think it affected him a little bit At any rate at one point my brotherinlaw Leonard decided to write a book about a serial killer This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity were in many years ago He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler And before he was arrested he had murdered his grandparents his mother and five coeds at UC Santa Cruz So my brotherinlaw goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying For one thing hes almost seven feet tall But thats not the most terrifying thing about him The scariest thing is that his IQ is  a certified genius But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy feeling with the other person Theyre controlled by different parts of the brain So at one point my brotherinlaw gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to and that is how could you have done it Didnt you feel any pity for your victims These were very intimate murders  he strangled his victims And the strangler says very matteroffactly Oh no If Id felt the distress I could not have done it I had to turn that part of me off I had to turn that part of me off And I think that that is very troubling and in a sense Ive been reflecting on turning that part of us off When we focus on ourselves in any activity we do turn that part of ourselves off if theres another person Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism Right now as Bill McDonough has pointed out the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences Were all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot We dont notice and dont notice that we dont notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats Or we dont know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill In other words were oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use In a sense the room itself is the elephant in the room but we dont see it And weve become victims of a system that points us elsewhere Consider this Theres a wonderful book called Stuff The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects And it talks about the back story of something like a tshirt And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer And it mentions for instance that cotton is very resistant to textile dye about  percent washes off into wastewater And its well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia Theres a company Bennett and Company that supplies Polocom Victorias Secret  they because of their CEO whos aware of this in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater Right now we dont have the option to choose the virtuous tshirt over the nonvirtuous one So what would it take to do that Well Ive been thinking For one thing theres a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store You can track it back to the factory Once you can track it back to the factory you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it and if its virtuous you can label it that way Or if its not so virtuous you can go into  today go into any store put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode which will take you to a website They have it for people with allergies to peanuts That website could tell you things about that object In other words at point of purchase we might be able to make a compassionate choice Theres a saying in the world of information science ultimately everybody will know everything And the question is will it make a difference Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times it was in the s I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York  it was homeless people on the streets And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go They had a diagnosis It made me  what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where when we see when were passing someone whos homeless in the periphery of our vision it stays on the periphery We dont notice and therefore we dont act One day soon after that  it was a Friday  at the end of the day I went down  I was going down to the subway It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side shirtless not moving and people were just stepping over him  hundreds and hundreds of people And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong The moment I stopped half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy And we found out that he was Hispanic he didnt speak any English he had no money hed been wandering the streets for days starving and hed fainted from hunger Immediately someone went to get orange juice someone brought a hotdog someone brought a subway cop This guy was back on his feet immediately But all it took was that simple act of noticing and so Im optimistic Thank you very much
