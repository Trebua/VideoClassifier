I want to start off by saying Houston we have a problem Were entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space In fact weve regressed We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done And that is instinctively weve gone out and climbed over difficult places went to more hostile places and found out later maybe to our surprise that thats the reason we survived And I feel very strongly that its not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that its OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it They need to look forward to exploration they need to look forward to colonization they need to look forward to breakthroughs We need to inspire them because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future Im particularly troubled that what NASAs doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to  for this next decade and a half  oh shoot I screwed up We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics What were looking forward to is  what were looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country  the Boeings and Lockheeds space engineers  to go out and take risks and try new stuff Were going to go back to the moon   years later And were going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new Im really troubled by that But anyway thats  the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later Thats the theme of my next  minutes here And I think that the inspiration begins when youre very young
 threeyearolds up to  yearolds What they look at is the most important thing Lets take a snapshot at aviation And there was a wonderful little short fouryear time period when marvelous things happened It started in  when the Wright brothers flew in Paris and everybody said Ooh hey I can do that Theres only a few people that have flown in early  In four years  countries had hundreds of airplanes thousand of pilots Airplanes were invented by natural selection Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes There were probably at least  different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot dont try that again The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition So we by making a whole bunch of attempts thousands of attempts in that fouryear time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today And thats why theyre so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to find whats good That has not happened at all in space flying Theres only been two concepts tried  two by the US and one by the Russians Well who was inspired during that time period Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first  years of aviation And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation Well what happened when I was a little kid was  some pretty heavy stuff too The jet age started the missile age started Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars  and this was before Sputnik And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now We thought thered be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right But you know NASA screwed that up because theyve sent these robots and theyve landed it only in the deserts If you look at what happened  this little black line is as fast as man ever flew and the red line is topoftheline military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport You notice heres a big jump when I was a little kid  and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people werent having the courage to try Well what did I do when I was a kid I didnt do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we didnt have drugs in those days But I did competition model airplanes I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flighttesting airplanes for the Air Force And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages And some  of those are flying Of course one of them is around the world Voyager I founded another company in  which is my company now And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since  And theres a lot of them that I actually cant show you on this chart The most impressive airplane ever I believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly taken out of service We retreated in  back to something that was developed in  What The most impressive spaceship ever I believe was a Grumman Lunar Lander It was a  you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon didnt need any maintenance guys  thats kind of cool Weve lost that capability We abandoned it in  This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in  Three years and we cant do that now Crazy Talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they die out when theyre replaced by something else These things tend to happen every  years  years long with an overlap You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies The interesting thing  by the way the speed here excuse me higherspeed travel is the title of these innovation cycles There is none here These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC that was done in  Heres the biggie and that is you dont have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it You know a good example of course is the DARPA net Computers were used for artillery first then IRS But when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it Private sector has to do it Keep that in mind I put down innovation  Ive looked for innovation cycles in space I found none The very first year starting when Gagarin went in space and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world  the very first year In  everyone that the United States sent to space was killed There were only three or four flights in  In  there were only two flights two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five which was the number the same year back in  There is no growth Theres no activity Theres no nothing This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne This is a picture here taken from orbit Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that We know how to do it for suborbital flying now do it safe enough  at least as safe as the early airlines  so that can be done And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company Well first of all whats going to happen next The first industry will be a high volume a lot of players Theres another one announced just last week And it will be suborbital And the reason it has to be suborbital is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit The governments have been doing this  three governments have been doing this for  years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died Thats  You dont want to run a business with that kind of a safety record Itll be very high volume we think  people will fly by  I cant tell you when this will start because I dont want my competition to know my schedule But I think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly youll see those resort hotels in orbit And that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view And that will be really cool Because the moon doesnt have an atmosphere  you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by  feet if you want Oh its going to be so much fun OK My critics say Hey Rutans just spending a lot of these billionaires money for joyrides for billionaires Whats this This is not a transportation system its just for fun And I used to be bothered by that and then I got to thinking well wait a minute I bought my first Apple computer in  and I bought it because I could say I got a computer at my house and you dont What do you use it for Come over It does Frogger OK Not the banks computer or Lockheeds computer but the home computer was for games For a whole decade it was for fun  we didnt even know what it was for But what happened the fact that we had this big industry big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes  we were ripe for a new invention And the inventor is in this audience Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that something that we used for a whole year  excuse me  a whole decade for fun became everything  our commerce our research our communication and if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list Laughter And it wont be very long before you wont be able to convince kids that we didnt always have computers in our homes So fun is defendable OK I want to show you kind of a busy chart but in it is my prediction with whats going to happen And in it also brings up another point right here Theres a group of people that have come forward  and you dont know all of them  but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children this little three to yearold age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period Paul Allen Elan Musk Richard Branson Jeff Bezos the Ansari family which is now funding the Russians suborbital thing Bob Bigelow a private space station and Carmack These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and I think its a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something  but theyre putting it in very  areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct They were inspired by big progress But look at the progress thats going on after that There were a couple of examples here The military fighters had a  highestperformance military airplane was the SR It went a whole life cycle got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel It went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service And were stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late s But something is out there to inspire our kids now And Im talking about if youve got a baby now or if youve got a yearold now Whats out there is theres something really interesting going to happen here Relatively soon youll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highestperformance military operational airplane Its never happened before The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in  minutes why do you need something better But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying suborbital flights to space very soon  wait a minute whats happening here well have military fighters with suborbital capability and I think very soon this But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first OK I look forward to a new capitalists space race lets call it You remember the space race in the s was for national prestige because we lost the first two milestones We didnt lose them technically The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it  you can argue thats not a technical loss Sputnik wasnt a technical loss but it was a prestige loss America  the world saw America as not being the leader in technology and that was a very strong thing And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin not months or decades or whatever So we had the capability But America lost We lost And because of that we made a big jump to recover it Well again whats interesting here is weve lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America  cant do it You can buy it in Russia You can fly with Russian hardware This is available because a Russian space program is starving and its nice for them to get  million here and there to take one of the seats Its commercial It can be defined as space tourism They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like Apollo  was done  million bucks  hey I can go to the moon But you know would you have thought back in the s when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalistlike thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware And would you have thought would the Russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware the guys inside wont be Russians Maybe itll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire Well thats weird you know it really is But anyway I think we need to beat them again I think what well do is well see a successful very successful private space flight industry Whether were first or not really doesnt matter The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde And then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered OK well talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight This little thing says here five times what NASAs doing by  I want to tell you already theres about  billion to  billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all  already worldwide If you read  if you Google it youll find about half of that money but theres twice of that being committed out there  not spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few years Hey thats pretty big Im predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be  and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at  dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less  this is going to be very profitable I predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the US taxpayer spends for NASAs manned spacecraft work And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of  to  And what that means is before we know it the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight And that is because its us Its private industry You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff  and weve done it for a long time The NACA before NASA never developed an airliner and never ran an airline But NASA is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line OK And weve shied away from it because were afraid of it But starting back in June of  when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it can get a start with it everything changed after that time OK thank you very much
