With all the legitimate concerns
about AIDS and avian flu  and well hear about that from the brilliant Dr Brilliant later today  I want to talk about the other
pandemic which is cardiovascular disease
diabetes hypertension  all of which are completely
preventable for at least  percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle And whats happening is that theres a globalization of illness
occurring that people are starting to eat like us
and live like us and die like us And
in one generation for example Asias gone from having
one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity
and diabetes to one of the highest And in Africa
cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries So theres a critical
window of opportunity we have to make an important
difference that can affect the lives of literally
millions of people and practice preventive
medicine on a global scale Heart and blood vessel
diseases still kill more people  not only in this
country but also worldwide  than everything
else combined and yet its completely preventable
for almost everybody Its not only preventable its actually reversible And for the last
almost  years weve been able to show
that by simply changing diet and lifestyle using
these very hightech expensive stateoftheart
measures to prove how powerful these very simple
and lowtech and lowcost interventions can be like  quantitative arteriography
before and after a year and cardiac PET scans We showed a few months
ago  we published the first study showing you
can actually stop or reverse the progression
of prostate cancer by making changes in diet
and lifestyle and  percent regression in the tumor
growth or inhibition of the tumor growth compared
to only nine percent in the control group And in the MRI and MR
spectroscopy here the prostate tumor activity
is shown in red  you can see it diminishing after a year Now there is an epidemic
of obesity twothirds of adults and  percent of kids
Whats really concerning to me is that diabetes has
increased  percent in the past  years and this may be the first generation in which our kids
live a shorter life span than we do Thats pitiful and its preventable Now these are not election
returns these are the people  the number
of the people who are obese by state beginning in 
   these are from the CDC website 
     you get a new category 
         
 it gets worse Were kind of devolving Laughter Now what can we do about this
Well you know the diet that weve found
that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet But the people in Asia
are starting to eat like we are which is why theyre
starting to get sick like we are So Ive been working
with a lot of the big food companies They can make
it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient
to eat healthier foods like  I chair the advisory
boards to McDonalds and PepsiCo and ConAgra
and Safeway and soon Del Monte and theyre
finding that its good business The salads that you see
at McDonalds came from the work  theyre going
to have an Asian salad At Pepsi twothirds
of their revenue growth came from their better foods And so if we can do that
then we can free up resources for buying drugs
that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV
and malaria and for preventing avian flu Thank you
