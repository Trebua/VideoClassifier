At the break I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate And this will be my only comment on it And that is I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists What Im going to tell you about in my  minutes is how were about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves Its only  years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a freeliving organism that of haemophilus influenzae That took a genome project from  years down to four months We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours So in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added most human pathogens a couple of plants several insects and several mammals including the human genome Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over  years ago was by the end of this year we might have between three and five genomes sequenced its on the order of several hundred We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence  genomes this year as a side project from environmental organisms So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed But as we look whats out there weve barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet Most people dont realize it because theyre invisible but microbes make up about a half of the Earths biomass whereas all animals only make up about one onethousandth of all the biomass And maybe its something that people in Oxford dont do very often but if you ever make it to the sea and you swallow a mouthful of seawater keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of  million viruses Less than  microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every  miles We started in Bermuda for our test project then moved up to Halifax working down the US East Coast the Caribbean Sea the Panama Canal through to the Galapagos then across the Pacific and were in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean Its very tough duty were doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science The experiments are incredibly simple We just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every  hours And with doing this weve made some amazing discoveries For example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes  there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments It turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication From one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered  million new genes and as many as  new species Weve extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation Were measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums We filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City And were in the process of sequencing all that at the present time Just on the data collection side just where we are through the Galapagos were finding that almost every  miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean Some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures  red being warm blue being cold  and we found theres a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant species The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence And these vary tremendously from region to region Maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where its mostly blue the photoreceptors tend to see blue light When theres a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light But they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data  including all of ours thus far from the expedition which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet  and it totaled around  million genes And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are Are we just discovering new members of known families or are we discovering new families And it turns out we have about  major gene families but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families So were at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes components and life on this planet When we look at the socalled evolutionary tree were up on the upper righthand corner with the animals Of those roughly  million genes we only have around  in our genome And if you take all animals together we probably share less than  and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution And we think in a genecentric view  maybe going back to Richard Dawkins ideas  than in a genomecentric view which are different constructs of these gene components Synthetic DNA the ability to synthesize DNA has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two and is getting very rapid and very cheap Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in  and that from mycoplasma genitalium And we have really nice Tshirts that say you know I heart my genitalium This is actually just a microorganism But it has roughly  genes Haemophilus had  genes And we simply asked the question if one species needs  another  is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system So we started doing transposon mutagenesis Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code And if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those nonessential genes But it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or nonessential gene based on exactly whats in the environment We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of  related organisms and we tried to compare all of those to see what they had in common And we got these overlapping circles And we found only  genes common to all  organisms The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around  or so So we think that we can expand or contract genomes depending on your point of view here to maybe  to  genes from the minimal of  The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them and we had to do this in a cassettebased fashion We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison my colleagues on this developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a base pair virus in only a twoweek period that was  percent accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology It was a quite exciting experiment  when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria This was not the first synthetic virus  a polio virus had been made a year before  but it was only one tenthousandth as active and it took three years to do This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X  This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and thats the notions that we have with biology People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee and a special committee the US government has set up to review this area And I think its important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with peoples imaginations Basically any virus thats been sequenced today  that genome can be made And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox but the DNA from this organism is not infective So even if somebody made the smallpox genome that DNA itself would not cause infections The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses And theres only two countries the US and the former Soviet Union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents If that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the knowhow to make designer viruses in the future I think singlecell organisms are possible within two years And possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade So were now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome The key is how do you put all of the others We start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome This is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about  to  hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart This organism is ubiquitous on the planet and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation The glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier Heres an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows the genome after  million rads of radiation The chromosome is literally blown apart And heres that same DNA automatically reassembled  hours later Its truly stunning that these organisms can do that and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that After these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues For example from the third organism we sequenced Methanococcus jannaschii  it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO it captures back from the environment So we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO and can capture that back So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere converting that into biopolymers or other products We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen Also theres numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products Within a short while I think theres going to be a new field called Combinatorial Genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day And therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether youre screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach Were trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen and we have an oxygeninsensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process Were also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce I think future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry Let me just close with ethical and policy studies We delayed the start of our experiments in  until we completed a yearandahalf bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species Every major religion participated in this It was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they couldnt find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be OK The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multiinstitutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area and were trying to set good examples as we go forward These are complex issues Except for the threat of bioterrorism theyre very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes Thank you very much
