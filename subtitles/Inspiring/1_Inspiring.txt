Thank you so much Chris And its truly a great honor
to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice
Im extremely grateful I have been blown away by this conference and I want to thank all of you
for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night And I say that sincerely partly because Mock sob I need that Put yourselves in my position I flew on Air Force Two for eight years Now I have to take off my shoes
or boots to get on an airplane Ill tell you one quick story to illustrate what
thats been like for me Its a true story 
every bit of this is true Soon after Tipper and I left the 
Mock sob White House  we were driving from our home
in Nashville to a little farm we have  miles east of Nashville Driving ourselves I know it sounds like
a little thing to you but  I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me There was no motorcade back there Youve heard of phantom limb pain This was a rented Ford Taurus It was dinnertime and we started looking for a place to eat We were on I We got to Exit  Lebanon Tennessee We got off the exit
we found a Shoneys restaurant Lowcost family restaurant chain
for those of you who dont know it We went in and sat down at the booth
and the waitress came over made a big commotion over Tipper She took our order and then went
to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear
what she was saying And she said Yes thats former
Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper And the man said Hes come down a long way hasnt he Theres been kind
of a series of epiphanies The very next day
continuing the totally true story I got on a GV to fly to Africa
to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Lagos
on the topic of energy And I began the speech
by telling them the story of what had just happened
the day before in Nashville And I told it pretty much the same way
Ive just shared it with you Tipper and I were driving ourselves Shoneys lowcost
family restaurant chain what the man said  they laughed I gave my speech then went back
out to the airport to fly back home I fell asleep on the plane until during the middle
of the night we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling I woke up they opened the door
I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man
running across the runway And he was waving a piece
of paper and he was yelling Call Washington Call Washington And I thought to myself
in the middle of the night in the middle of the Atlantic what in the world could be
wrong in Washington Then I remembered
it could be a bunch of things But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services
in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America It was printed in Monterey I checked And the story began Former Vice President Al Gore
announced in Nigeria yesterday quote My wife Tipper and I have opened
a lowcost family restaurant  named Shoneys and we are running it ourselves Before I could get back to US soil David Letterman and Jay Leno
had already started in on  one of them had me
in a big white chefs hat Tipper was saying
One more burger with fries Three days later I got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and partner
and colleague Bill Clinton saying Congratulations
on the new restaurant Al We like to celebrate
each others successes in life I was going to talk
about information ecology But I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit
of coming back to TED that maybe I could talk
about that another time Chris Anderson Its a deal Al Gore I want to focus
on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on What can you do about the climate crisis I want to start with a couple of  Im going to show some new images and Im going to recapitulate
just four or five Now the slide show I update the slide show
every time I give it I add new images because I learn more about it
every time I give it Its like beachcombing you know Every time the tide comes in and out
you find some more shells Just in the last two days we got
the new temperature records in January This is just for
the United States of America Historical average
for Januarys is  degrees last month was  degrees Now I know that you wanted some more
bad news about the environment  Im kidding But these are the recapitulation slides and then Im going to go into new
material about what you can do But I wanted to elaborate
on a couple of these First of all this is where
were projected to go with the US contribution
to global warming under business as usual Efficiency in enduse electricity
and enduse of all energy is the lowhanging fruit Efficiency and conservation 
its not a cost its a profit The sign is wrong Its not negative its positive These are investments
that pay for themselves But they are also very effective
in deflecting our path Cars and trucks  I talked
about that in the slideshow but I want you to put it in perspective Its an easy visible target of concern  and it should be  but there is more global warming pollution
that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks Cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest
standards in the world And so we should address that
But its part of the puzzle Other transportation efficiency
is as important as cars and trucks Renewables at the current levels
of technological efficiency can make this much difference And with what Vinod and John Doerr
and others many of you here  there are a lot of people
directly involved in this  this wedge is going to grow
much more rapidly than the current projection shows it Carbon Capture and Sequestration 
thats what CCS stands for  is likely to become the killer app
that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels
in a way that is safe Not quite there yet OK Now what can you do Reduce emissions in your home Most of these expenditures
are also profitable Insulation better design Buy green electricity where you can I mentioned automobiles  buy a hybrid Use light rail Figure out some of the other options
that are much better Its important Be a green consumer You have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect
on the global climate crisis Consider this Make a decision to live
a carbonneutral life Those of you who are good at branding Id love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way
that connects with the most people It is easier than you think It really is A lot of us in here
have made that decision and it is really pretty easy It means reduce
your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range
of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not
completely reduced And what it means is elaborated
at climatecrisisnet There is a carbon calculator Participant Productions convened  with my active involvement  the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science
of carbon calculation to construct a consumerfriendly
carbon calculator You can very precisely calculate
what your CO emissions are and then you will be given
options to reduce And by the time the movie
comes out in May this will be updated to  and we will have clickthrough
purchases of offsets Next consider making
your business carbonneutral Again some of us have done that and its not as hard as you think Integrate climate solutions
into all of your innovations whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design
and architecture community Invest sustainably Majora mentioned this Listen if you have invested money
with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance dont ever again complain
about quarterly report CEO management Over time people do
what you pay them to do And if they judge how much
theyre going to get paid on your capital that theyve invested based on the shortterm returns youre going to get shortterm decisions A lot more to be said about that Become a catalyst of change Teach others learn about it
talk about it The movie is a movie version
of the slideshow I gave two nights ago
except its a lot more entertaining And it comes out in May Many of you here have the opportunity
to ensure that a lot of people see it Consider sending somebody to Nashville Pick well And I am personally going to train people
to give this slideshow  repurposed with some
of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and its not just the slides
its what they mean And its how they link together And so Im going to be conducting
a course this summer for a group of people that are
nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and were going to update the slideshow
for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge Working with Larry Lessig it will be
somewhere in that process posted with tools
and limiteduse copyrights so that young people can remix it
and do it in their own way Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay
arms length from politics It doesnt mean
that if youre a Republican that Im trying to convince you
to be a Democrat We need Republicans as well This used to be a bipartisan issue and I know that
in this group it really is Become politically active Make our democracy work the way
its supposed to work Support the idea of capping
carbon dioxide emissions  global warming pollution 
and trading it Heres why as long as the United States
is out of the world system its not a closed system Once it becomes a closed system
with US participation then everybody
whos on a board of directors  how many people here
serve on the board of directors of a corporation Once its a closed system you will have legal liability
if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing
and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided The market will work
to solve this problem  if we can accomplish this Help with the mass persuasion campaign
that will start this spring We have to change the minds
of the American people Because presently the politicians
do not have permission to do what needs to be done And in our modern country the role
of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power
the way it once did Its now repetition of short hotbutton
second second television ads We have to buy a lot of those ads Lets rebrand global warming
as many of you have suggested I like climate crisis
instead of climate collapse but again those of you
who are good at branding I need your help on this Somebody said the test
were facing now a scientist told me is whether the combination
of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination Thats really true I said the other night
and Ill repeat now this is not a political issue Again the Republicans here 
this shouldnt be partisan You have more influence
than some of us who are Democrats do This is an opportunity Not just this but connected
to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them We are one Thank you very much I appreciate it
