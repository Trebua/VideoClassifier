1,"Thank you so much Chris And its truly a great honor
to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice
Im extremely grateful I have been blown away by this conference and I want to thank all of you
for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night And I say that sincerely partly because Mock sob I need that Put yourselves in my position I flew on Air Force Two for eight years Now I have to take off my shoes
or boots to get on an airplane Ill tell you one quick story to illustrate what
thats been like for me Its a true story 
every bit of this is true Soon after Tipper and I left the 
Mock sob White House  we were driving from our home
in Nashville to a little farm we have  miles east of Nashville Driving ourselves I know it sounds like
a little thing to you but  I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me There was no motorcade back there Youve heard of phantom limb pain This was a rented Ford Taurus It was dinnertime and we started looking for a place to eat We were on I We got to Exit  Lebanon Tennessee We got off the exit
we found a Shoneys restaurant Lowcost family restaurant chain
for those of you who dont know it We went in and sat down at the booth
and the waitress came over made a big commotion over Tipper She took our order and then went
to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear
what she was saying And she said Yes thats former
Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper And the man said Hes come down a long way hasnt he Theres been kind
of a series of epiphanies The very next day
continuing the totally true story I got on a GV to fly to Africa
to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Lagos
on the topic of energy And I began the speech
by telling them the story of what had just happened
the day before in Nashville And I told it pretty much the same way
Ive just shared it with you Tipper and I were driving ourselves Shoneys lowcost
family restaurant chain what the man said  they laughed I gave my speech then went back
out to the airport to fly back home I fell asleep on the plane until during the middle
of the night we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling I woke up they opened the door
I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man
running across the runway And he was waving a piece
of paper and he was yelling Call Washington Call Washington And I thought to myself
in the middle of the night in the middle of the Atlantic what in the world could be
wrong in Washington Then I remembered
it could be a bunch of things But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services
in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America It was printed in Monterey I checked And the story began Former Vice President Al Gore
announced in Nigeria yesterday quote My wife Tipper and I have opened
a lowcost family restaurant  named Shoneys and we are running it ourselves Before I could get back to US soil David Letterman and Jay Leno
had already started in on  one of them had me
in a big white chefs hat Tipper was saying
One more burger with fries Three days later I got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and partner
and colleague Bill Clinton saying Congratulations
on the new restaurant Al We like to celebrate
each others successes in life I was going to talk
about information ecology But I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit
of coming back to TED that maybe I could talk
about that another time Chris Anderson Its a deal Al Gore I want to focus
on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on What can you do about the climate crisis I want to start with a couple of  Im going to show some new images and Im going to recapitulate
just four or five Now the slide show I update the slide show
every time I give it I add new images because I learn more about it
every time I give it Its like beachcombing you know Every time the tide comes in and out
you find some more shells Just in the last two days we got
the new temperature records in January This is just for
the United States of America Historical average
for Januarys is  degrees last month was  degrees Now I know that you wanted some more
bad news about the environment  Im kidding But these are the recapitulation slides and then Im going to go into new
material about what you can do But I wanted to elaborate
on a couple of these First of all this is where
were projected to go with the US contribution
to global warming under business as usual Efficiency in enduse electricity
and enduse of all energy is the lowhanging fruit Efficiency and conservation 
its not a cost its a profit The sign is wrong Its not negative its positive These are investments
that pay for themselves But they are also very effective
in deflecting our path Cars and trucks  I talked
about that in the slideshow but I want you to put it in perspective Its an easy visible target of concern  and it should be  but there is more global warming pollution
that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks Cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest
standards in the world And so we should address that
But its part of the puzzle Other transportation efficiency
is as important as cars and trucks Renewables at the current levels
of technological efficiency can make this much difference And with what Vinod and John Doerr
and others many of you here  there are a lot of people
directly involved in this  this wedge is going to grow
much more rapidly than the current projection shows it Carbon Capture and Sequestration 
thats what CCS stands for  is likely to become the killer app
that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels
in a way that is safe Not quite there yet OK Now what can you do Reduce emissions in your home Most of these expenditures
are also profitable Insulation better design Buy green electricity where you can I mentioned automobiles  buy a hybrid Use light rail Figure out some of the other options
that are much better Its important Be a green consumer You have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect
on the global climate crisis Consider this Make a decision to live
a carbonneutral life Those of you who are good at branding Id love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way
that connects with the most people It is easier than you think It really is A lot of us in here
have made that decision and it is really pretty easy It means reduce
your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range
of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not
completely reduced And what it means is elaborated
at climatecrisisnet There is a carbon calculator Participant Productions convened  with my active involvement  the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science
of carbon calculation to construct a consumerfriendly
carbon calculator You can very precisely calculate
what your CO emissions are and then you will be given
options to reduce And by the time the movie
comes out in May this will be updated to  and we will have clickthrough
purchases of offsets Next consider making
your business carbonneutral Again some of us have done that and its not as hard as you think Integrate climate solutions
into all of your innovations whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design
and architecture community Invest sustainably Majora mentioned this Listen if you have invested money
with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance dont ever again complain
about quarterly report CEO management Over time people do
what you pay them to do And if they judge how much
theyre going to get paid on your capital that theyve invested based on the shortterm returns youre going to get shortterm decisions A lot more to be said about that Become a catalyst of change Teach others learn about it
talk about it The movie is a movie version
of the slideshow I gave two nights ago
except its a lot more entertaining And it comes out in May Many of you here have the opportunity
to ensure that a lot of people see it Consider sending somebody to Nashville Pick well And I am personally going to train people
to give this slideshow  repurposed with some
of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and its not just the slides
its what they mean And its how they link together And so Im going to be conducting
a course this summer for a group of people that are
nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and were going to update the slideshow
for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge Working with Larry Lessig it will be
somewhere in that process posted with tools
and limiteduse copyrights so that young people can remix it
and do it in their own way Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay
arms length from politics It doesnt mean
that if youre a Republican that Im trying to convince you
to be a Democrat We need Republicans as well This used to be a bipartisan issue and I know that
in this group it really is Become politically active Make our democracy work the way
its supposed to work Support the idea of capping
carbon dioxide emissions  global warming pollution 
and trading it Heres why as long as the United States
is out of the world system its not a closed system Once it becomes a closed system
with US participation then everybody
whos on a board of directors  how many people here
serve on the board of directors of a corporation Once its a closed system you will have legal liability
if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing
and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided The market will work
to solve this problem  if we can accomplish this Help with the mass persuasion campaign
that will start this spring We have to change the minds
of the American people Because presently the politicians
do not have permission to do what needs to be done And in our modern country the role
of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power
the way it once did Its now repetition of short hotbutton
second second television ads We have to buy a lot of those ads Lets rebrand global warming
as many of you have suggested I like climate crisis
instead of climate collapse but again those of you
who are good at branding I need your help on this Somebody said the test
were facing now a scientist told me is whether the combination
of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination Thats really true I said the other night
and Ill repeat now this is not a political issue Again the Republicans here 
this shouldnt be partisan You have more influence
than some of us who are Democrats do This is an opportunity Not just this but connected
to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them We are one Thank you very much I appreciate it ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2,"In terms of invention Id like to tell you the tale
of one of my favorite projects I think its one of the most exciting
that Im working on but I think its also the simplest Its a project that has the potential
to make a huge impact around the world It addresses one of the biggest
health issues on the planet the number one cause of death
in children under five Which is  Waterborne diseases
Diarrhea Malnutrition No Its breathing the smoke
from indoor cooking fires  acute respiratory infections
caused by this Can you believe that I find this shocking
and somewhat appalling Cant we make
cleaner burning cooking fuels Cant we make better stoves How is it that this can lead
to over two million deaths every year I know Bill Joy was talking to you
about the wonders of carbon nanotubes so Im going to talk to you
about the wonders of carbon macrotubes which is charcoal So this is a picture of rural Haiti Haiti is now  percent deforested Youll see scenes like this
all over the island It leads to all sorts
of environmental problems and problems that affect people
throughout the nation A couple years ago
there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths  thats directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills
to stabilize the soil So the rains come  they go down the rivers
and the flooding happens Now one of the reasons
why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood
and they make charcoal in order to do it Its not that people are ignorant
to the environmental damage They know perfectly well
but they have no other choice Fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesnt cook the way
that they like their food prepared And so this is what they do Youll find families like this who go out
into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it So not surprisingly theres a lot of effort thats been done
to look at alternative cooking fuels About four years ago I took
a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with
Peace Corps volunteers there This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built
in the village where he worked And the idea was
that you could take waste paper you could compress it and make briquettes
that could be used for fuel But this device was very slow So our engineering students
went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple
the throughput of this device So you could imagine
they were very excited about it And they took the briquettes back to MIT
so that they could test them And one of the things
that they found was they didnt burn So it was a little
discouraging to the students And in fact if you look closely right here you can see
it says US Peace Corps As it turns out there actually wasnt
any waste paper in this village And while it was a good use
of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it
back with him to his village it was  kilometers away And so we thought perhaps
there might be a better way to come up with
an alternative cooking fuel What we wanted to do
is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was
readily available on the local level You see these all over Haiti as well Theyre smallscale sugar mills And the waste product from them after you extract the juice
from the sugarcane is called bagasse It has no other use It has no nutritional value
so they dont feed it to the animals It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill
until eventually they burn it What we wanted to do was
we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource
and turn it into a fuel that would be something
that people could easily cook with something like charcoal So over the next couple of years students and I worked
to develop a process So you start with the bagasse
and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of
a waste fifty fivegallon oil drum After some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen
that goes into the kiln and then you end up
with this carbonized material here However you cant burn this Its too fine and it burns too quickly
to be useful for cooking So we had to try to find a way
to form it into useful briquettes And conveniently
one of my students was from Ghana and he remembered a dish his mom
used to make for him called kokonte which is a very sticky porridge
made out of the cassava root And so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava
is indeed grown in Haiti under the name of manioc In fact its grown all over the world  yucca tapioca manioc cassava
its all the same thing  a very starchy root vegetable And you can make a very thick
sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together
the charcoal briquettes So we did this We went down to Haiti These are the graduates
of the first Ecole de Charbon or Charcoal Institute And these  Thats right So Im actually
an instructor at MIT as well as CIT And these are the briquettes that we made Now Im going to take you
to a different continent This is India and this is the most commonly used
cooking fuel in India Its cow dung And more than in Haiti
this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see
the health impacts of cooking with cow dung
and biomass as a fuel Kids and women
are especially affected by it because theyre the ones
who are around the cooking fires So we wanted to see if we could introduce
this charcoalmaking technology there Well unfortunately
they didnt have sugarcane and they didnt have cassava but that didnt stop us What we did was we found what were
the locally available sources of biomass And there was wheat straw
and there was rice straw in this area And what we could use as a binder
was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel And we did sidebyside tests and here you can see
the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung And you can see that its a lot cleaner
burning of a cooking fuel And in fact it heats the water
a lot more quickly And so we were very happy thus far But one of the things that we found was when we did sidebyside
comparisons with wood charcoal it didnt burn as long And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart
as they were cooking So we wanted to try to find a way
to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with
wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti So we went back to MIT we took out the Instron machine and we figured out
what sort of forces you needed in order to compress
a briquette to the level that you actually are getting
improved performance out of it And at the same time that we had
students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners in Haiti
working to develop the process to improve it and make it more accessible
to people in the villages there And after some time we developed a lowcost press
that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns not only  actually it burns longer
cleaner than wood charcoal So now were in a situation
where we have a product which is actually better than what
you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace which is a very wonderful place to be In Haiti alone about  million trees
are cut down every year Theres a possibility
of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those In addition the revenue generated
from that charcoal is  million dollars Thats an awful lot
for a country like Haiti  with a population of eight million and an average income
of less than  dollars So this is where were also moving ahead
with our charcoal project And one of the things
that I think is also interesting is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley
whos been doing risk analysis And hes looked at the problem
of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal And hes found that worldwide
you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood
to charcoal as a cooking fuel Thats remarkable but up until now there werent ways
to do it without cutting down trees But now we have a way thats using an agricultural
waste material to create a cooking fuel One of the really exciting things though is something that came out of the trip
that I took to Ghana just last month And I think its the coolest thing and its even lower tech
than what you just saw if you can imagine such a thing Here it is So what is this This is corncobs turned into charcoal And the beauty of this is
that you dont need to form briquettes  it comes ready made This is my  laptop right here And actually like Nick
I brought samples So we can pass these around Theyre fully functional
fieldtested ready to roll out And I think one of the things which is also remarkable
about this technology is that the technology
transfer is so easy Compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we have to teach people
how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step
of cooking the binder this comes prebriquetted And this is about the most exciting
thing in my life right now which is perhaps
a sad commentary on my life But once you see it
like you guys in the front row  All right yeah OK So anyway  Here it is And this is I think a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about
in those nonzerosum things So not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits But this is one
of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits People can make their own cooking fuel
from waste products They can generate income from this They can save the money
that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess
and sell it in the market to people who arent making their own Its really rare
that you dont have tradeoffs between health and economics
or environment and economics So this is a project
that I just find extremely exciting and Im really looking forward
to see where it takes us So when we talk about now
the future we will create one of the things
that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision
of the world that we live in And now I dont actually mean
the world that we live in I mean the world where women
spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat I mean the world
where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles
that are made by hand and where when you work  hours a day youre still only earning
 dollars in a month I mean the world where women and children spend
 billion hours a year fetching water Thats as if the entire workforce
of the state of California worked full time for a year
doing nothing but fetching water Its a place where
for example if this were India in this room only three of us
would have a car If this were Afghanistan only one person in this room
would know how the use the Internet If this were Zambia   of you would be farmers  of you would have AIDS or HIV And more than half of you would be living
on less than a dollar a day These are the issues that we
need to come up with solutions for These are the issues that
we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people
our entrepreneurs to be facing These are the solutions
that we need to find I have a few areas that I believe
are especially important that we address One of them is creating technologies to promote microfinance
and microenterprise so that people who are living
below the poverty line can find a way to move out  and that theyre not doing it using the same traditional
basket making poultry rearing etc But there are new technologies
and new products that they can make on a small scale The next thing I believe is that we need to create
technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops And we need to rethink
our development strategies so that were not promoting
educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers but rather to stop being poor farmers And we need to think
about how we can do that effectively We need to work with the people
in these communities and give them the resources
and the tools that they need to solve their own problems Thats the best way to do it We shouldnt be doing it from outside So we need to create this future
and we need to start doing it now Thank you Chris Anderson Thank you incredible Stay here Tell us  just while we see
if someone has a question  just tell us about one of the other things
that youve worked on Amy Smith Some of the other
things were working on are ways to do lowcost
water quality testing so that communities can maintain
their own water systems know when theyre working
know when they treat them etc Were also looking at lowcost
watertreatment systems One of the really exciting things
is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability
to be able to do that CA Whats the bottleneck
preventing this stuff getting from scale Do you need to find entrepreneurs
or venture capitalists or what do you need to take
what youve got and get it to scale AS I think its large numbers
of people moving it forward Its a difficult thing  its a marketplace
which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income So you cant use the same models
that you use in the United States for making things move forward And were a pretty small staff which is me So you know
I do what I can with the students We have  students a year
go out into the field and try to implement this
and move it forward The other thing is you have to do things
with a long time frame as you know you cant expect to get
something done in a year or two years you have to be looking
five or  years ahead But I think with the vision to do that
we can move forward ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
3,A public Dewey long ago observed is constituted through discussion and debate If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question and avoid doxa the realm of the unquestioned then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time namely how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building To put the assumptions very clearly capitalism after  years has become acceptable and so has democracy If we looked in the world of  and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities they were the rare exception not the norm The question now however is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions And that provides the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment allows us to act And it is necessary no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus to be able to move forward But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights about denial of justice rather than provision of it And in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences First extractive industry Blood diamonds smuggled emeralds timber that is cut right from under the poorest Second is technical assistance And technical assistance might shock you but its the worst form of  today  of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to  dollars a day who are incapable of thinking creatively or organically Next assumption  and of course the events of July  I express my deep sympathy and before that September   have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds We live in one world But thats easily said But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in And that is that if we want to have one world this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion and then inclusion for some We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics What is one of these organizations to pick We have three critical terms economy civil society and the state I will not deal with those first two except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions from one context to another can only make for disaster Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia Textbook economics does not work in my context and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling for which I have enormous respect My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best Second instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state why dont we simplify and say what are a series of functions that the state in the st century must perform Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this we hope to share that much widely with  and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places So what are these functions We propose  And its legitimate monopoly of means of violence administrative control management of public finances investment in human capital provision of citizenship rights provision of infrastructure management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation creation of the market international agreements including public borrowing and then most importantly rule of law I wont elaborate I hope the questions will give me an opportunity This is a feasible goal basically because contrary to widespread assumption I would argue that we know how to do this Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of  But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning And there are lots of other examples Now in order to do this  and this brings this group  we have to rethink the notion of capital The least important form of capital in this project is financial capital  money Money is not capital in most of the developing countries Its just cash Because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into capital And what is required is a combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital  and security of course is critical but so is information Now the issue that should concern us here  and thats the challenge that I would like to pose to this group  is again it takes  years in your countries to produce somebody with a BS degree It takes  years to produce somebody with a PhD The first challenge is to rethink fundamentally the issue of the time Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited Our educational systems are inherited from the th century What is it that we need to do fundamentally to reengage in a project that capital formation is rapid The absolute majority of the worlds population are below  and they are growing larger and faster They need different ways of being approached different ways of being enfranchised different ways of being skilled And thats the first thing Second is youre problem solvers but youre not engaging your global responsibility Youve stayed away from the problems of corruption You only want clean environments in which to function But if you dont think through the problems of corruption who will You stay away from design for development Youre great designers but your designs are selfish Its for your own immediate use The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads or dams or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in  years This is not right It requires thinking But particularly what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work As the work on paradigms long time ago showed  Thomas Kuhns work  its in the intersection of ideas that new developments  true breakthroughs  occur And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the worlds poor through this means Thank you Chris Anderson So Ashraf until recently you were the finance minister of Afghanistan a country right at the middle of much of the worlds agenda Is the country gonna make it Will democracy flourish What scares you most Ashraf Ghani What scares me most is  is you lack of your engagement You asked me You know I always give the unconventional answer No But seriously the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as at least a  to year perspective Today the world of globalization is on speed Time has been compressed And space does not exist for most people But in my world  you know when I went back to Afghanistan after  years space had expanded Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down I rode  traveled  travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took  So the first is when the scale is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure  it takes six years to deliver infrastructure In our world Any meaningful sort of thing But the modality of attention or what is happening today whats happening tomorrow Second is when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense brutal forms of exercise of power  we had the Red Army for  continuous years  strong literally terrorizing The sky every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear We were bombed practically out of existence Then tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism  from all sides The United States Great Britain joined for instance Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror How to turn a donkey a carthorse anything And the Russians equally So when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan its because of that legacy But we have to understand that weve been incredibly lucky I mean I really cant believe how lucky I am here standing in front of you speaking When I joined as finance minister I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent Those were the risks They were worth it I think we can make it and the reason we can make it is because of the people You see because I mean  I give you one statistic  percent of the men in Afghanistan  percent of the women listen to at least three radio stations a day In terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world I think that I would dare say theyre much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans  because the world matters to them And what is their predominant concern Abandonment Afghans have become deeply internationalist You know when I went back in December of  I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because Id lived as a nationalist And I told them  my people with the Americans here  separate Yes I have an advisory position with the UN I went through  Afghan provinces very rapidly And everybody was telling me it was a different world You know they engage They see engagement global engagement as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is  Clare Lockhart is here so Ill recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan And that woman said she didnt care whether she had food on her table What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future where her children could really have a different life That gives me hope CA How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade AG Certainly Well the first is instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies they should give this hundred billion dollars to  of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs The key to the drug eradication is jobs Look theres a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of  dollars dont produce drugs Second textile Trade is the key not aid The US and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff The textile industry is incredibly mobile If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector if there was zero tariffs  would create the type of job Cotton does not compete with opium a tshirt does And we need to understand its the value chain Look the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit It is important but what the ordinary women and men who engage in microproduction want is global access They dont want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners  and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms Yeah we have the best embroiderers in the world Why cant we do what was done with northern Italy With the Put Out system So I think economically the critical issue really is to now think through And what I will say here is that aid doesnt work You know the aid system is broken The aid system does not have the knowledge the vision the ability Im all for it after all I raised a lot of it Yeah to be exact you know I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country  billion They didnt want to give us the money CA And it still didnt work AG No Its not that it didnt work Its that a dollar of private investment in my judgment is equal at least to  dollars of aid in terms of the dynamic that it generates Second is that one dollar of aid could be  cents it could be  cents or it could be four dollars It depends on what form it comes what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it You know the aid system at first was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries not to generate growth in the poor countries And this is again one of those assumptions  the way car seats are an assumption that weve inherited in governments and doors You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries provide advice but they do Theres an entire weight of history visavis aid that now needs to be reexamined If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves  and Im putting that proposition equally you know Im very harsh on my counterparts  aid must end in each country in a definable period And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy Unless that kind of compact is entered into you will not be able to sustain

4,"I want to start off by saying Houston we have a problem Were entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space In fact weve regressed We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done And that is instinctively weve gone out and climbed over difficult places went to more hostile places and found out later maybe to our surprise that thats the reason we survived And I feel very strongly that its not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that its OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it They need to look forward to exploration they need to look forward to colonization they need to look forward to breakthroughs We need to inspire them because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future Im particularly troubled that what NASAs doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to  for this next decade and a half  oh shoot I screwed up We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics What were looking forward to is  what were looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country  the Boeings and Lockheeds space engineers  to go out and take risks and try new stuff Were going to go back to the moon   years later And were going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new Im really troubled by that But anyway thats  the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later Thats the theme of my next  minutes here And I think that the inspiration begins when youre very young
 threeyearolds up to  yearolds What they look at is the most important thing Lets take a snapshot at aviation And there was a wonderful little short fouryear time period when marvelous things happened It started in  when the Wright brothers flew in Paris and everybody said Ooh hey I can do that Theres only a few people that have flown in early  In four years  countries had hundreds of airplanes thousand of pilots Airplanes were invented by natural selection Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes There were probably at least  different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot dont try that again The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition So we by making a whole bunch of attempts thousands of attempts in that fouryear time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today And thats why theyre so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to find whats good That has not happened at all in space flying Theres only been two concepts tried  two by the US and one by the Russians Well who was inspired during that time period Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first  years of aviation And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation Well what happened when I was a little kid was  some pretty heavy stuff too The jet age started the missile age started Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars  and this was before Sputnik And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now We thought thered be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right But you know NASA screwed that up because theyve sent these robots and theyve landed it only in the deserts If you look at what happened  this little black line is as fast as man ever flew and the red line is topoftheline military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport You notice heres a big jump when I was a little kid  and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people werent having the courage to try Well what did I do when I was a kid I didnt do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we didnt have drugs in those days But I did competition model airplanes I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flighttesting airplanes for the Air Force And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages And some  of those are flying Of course one of them is around the world Voyager I founded another company in  which is my company now And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since  And theres a lot of them that I actually cant show you on this chart The most impressive airplane ever I believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly taken out of service We retreated in  back to something that was developed in  What The most impressive spaceship ever I believe was a Grumman Lunar Lander It was a  you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon didnt need any maintenance guys  thats kind of cool Weve lost that capability We abandoned it in  This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in  Three years and we cant do that now Crazy Talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they die out when theyre replaced by something else These things tend to happen every  years  years long with an overlap You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies The interesting thing  by the way the speed here excuse me higherspeed travel is the title of these innovation cycles There is none here These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC that was done in  Heres the biggie and that is you dont have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it You know a good example of course is the DARPA net Computers were used for artillery first then IRS But when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it Private sector has to do it Keep that in mind I put down innovation  Ive looked for innovation cycles in space I found none The very first year starting when Gagarin went in space and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world  the very first year In  everyone that the United States sent to space was killed There were only three or four flights in  In  there were only two flights two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five which was the number the same year back in  There is no growth Theres no activity Theres no nothing This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne This is a picture here taken from orbit Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that We know how to do it for suborbital flying now do it safe enough  at least as safe as the early airlines  so that can be done And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company Well first of all whats going to happen next The first industry will be a high volume a lot of players Theres another one announced just last week And it will be suborbital And the reason it has to be suborbital is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit The governments have been doing this  three governments have been doing this for  years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died Thats  You dont want to run a business with that kind of a safety record Itll be very high volume we think  people will fly by  I cant tell you when this will start because I dont want my competition to know my schedule But I think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly youll see those resort hotels in orbit And that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view And that will be really cool Because the moon doesnt have an atmosphere  you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by  feet if you want Oh its going to be so much fun OK My critics say Hey Rutans just spending a lot of these billionaires money for joyrides for billionaires Whats this This is not a transportation system its just for fun And I used to be bothered by that and then I got to thinking well wait a minute I bought my first Apple computer in  and I bought it because I could say I got a computer at my house and you dont What do you use it for Come over It does Frogger OK Not the banks computer or Lockheeds computer but the home computer was for games For a whole decade it was for fun  we didnt even know what it was for But what happened the fact that we had this big industry big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes  we were ripe for a new invention And the inventor is in this audience Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that something that we used for a whole year  excuse me  a whole decade for fun became everything  our commerce our research our communication and if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list Laughter And it wont be very long before you wont be able to convince kids that we didnt always have computers in our homes So fun is defendable OK I want to show you kind of a busy chart but in it is my prediction with whats going to happen And in it also brings up another point right here Theres a group of people that have come forward  and you dont know all of them  but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children this little three to yearold age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period Paul Allen Elan Musk Richard Branson Jeff Bezos the Ansari family which is now funding the Russians suborbital thing Bob Bigelow a private space station and Carmack These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and I think its a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something  but theyre putting it in very  areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct They were inspired by big progress But look at the progress thats going on after that There were a couple of examples here The military fighters had a  highestperformance military airplane was the SR It went a whole life cycle got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel It went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service And were stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late s But something is out there to inspire our kids now And Im talking about if youve got a baby now or if youve got a yearold now Whats out there is theres something really interesting going to happen here Relatively soon youll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highestperformance military operational airplane Its never happened before The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in  minutes why do you need something better But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying suborbital flights to space very soon  wait a minute whats happening here well have military fighters with suborbital capability and I think very soon this But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first OK I look forward to a new capitalists space race lets call it You remember the space race in the s was for national prestige because we lost the first two milestones We didnt lose them technically The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it  you can argue thats not a technical loss Sputnik wasnt a technical loss but it was a prestige loss America  the world saw America as not being the leader in technology and that was a very strong thing And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin not months or decades or whatever So we had the capability But America lost We lost And because of that we made a big jump to recover it Well again whats interesting here is weve lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America  cant do it You can buy it in Russia You can fly with Russian hardware This is available because a Russian space program is starving and its nice for them to get  million here and there to take one of the seats Its commercial It can be defined as space tourism They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like Apollo  was done  million bucks  hey I can go to the moon But you know would you have thought back in the s when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalistlike thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware And would you have thought would the Russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware the guys inside wont be Russians Maybe itll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire Well thats weird you know it really is But anyway I think we need to beat them again I think what well do is well see a successful very successful private space flight industry Whether were first or not really doesnt matter The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde And then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered OK well talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight This little thing says here five times what NASAs doing by  I want to tell you already theres about  billion to  billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all  already worldwide If you read  if you Google it youll find about half of that money but theres twice of that being committed out there  not spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few years Hey thats pretty big Im predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be  and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at  dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less  this is going to be very profitable I predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the US taxpayer spends for NASAs manned spacecraft work And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of  to  And what that means is before we know it the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight And that is because its us Its private industry You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff  and weve done it for a long time The NACA before NASA never developed an airliner and never ran an airline But NASA is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line OK And weve shied away from it because were afraid of it But starting back in June of  when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it can get a start with it everything changed after that time OK thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
5,What I want to talk about is as background is the idea that cars are art This is actually quite meaningful to me because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole  we dont do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it  and cars are thought so much as a product that its a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art And so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane  if you accept that  that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A Now at this point youre going to see a picture of Michelangelo This is completely different than automobiles Automobiles are selfmoving things right Elevators are automobiles And theyre not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for  years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways theyve also been a real pain in the ass because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve We have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion  but thats not what interests me in this speech What interests me in this speech is cars Automobiles may be what you use but cars are what we are in many ways And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and I believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like BMW is really hip on and lots of other things then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us  of this caryness  and what that means what we can learn from it Thats what I want to get to Cars are not a suit of clothes cars are an avatar Cars are an expansion of yourself they take your thoughts your ideas your emotions and they multiply it  your anger whatever Its an avatar Its a superwaldo that you happen to be inside of and if you feel sexy the car is sexy And if youre full of road rage youve got a Chevy Like a Rock right Cars are a sculpture  did you know this That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand Many people think Well its computers and its done by machines and stuff like that Well they reproduce it but the originals are all done by hand Its done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum That tension between the need to express the need to discover then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship Rules that say this is how you handle surfaces this is what control is all about this is how you show youre a master of your craft And that tension that discovery that push for something new  and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship  thats as strong in cars as it is in anything We work in clay which hasnt changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it and theres a very interesting analogy to that too Real quickly  Michelangelo once said hes there to discover the figure within OK There we go the automobile That was  years right there  did you catch that Between that one there and that one there it changed a lot didnt it OK its not marketing theres a very interesting car concept here but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here I want to talk about this Why it means you have to wash a car what is it that sensuality you have to touch about it Thats the sculpture that goes into it That sensuality And its done by men and women working just like this making cars Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore I believe that that pressure within that Moores talking about  at least when it comes to cars  comes right back to this idea of the mean Its that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me And we tell other people Do this do this do this until this thing comes alive We are completely infected And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness its quite wonderful This sculpture is of course at the heart of all of it and its really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars And its not a whole lot different really when theyre working like this or when somebody works like this Its that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty Now now I get to the point I want to talk about cars as art Art in the Platonic sense is truth its beauty and love Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers We dont really have a problem talking about love We dont have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense Thats what were searching for  when were working our craft we are really trying to find that truth out there Were not trying to find vanity and beauty Were trying to find the beauty in the truth However engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian instead of this quantum approach Were dealing with irrationalisms and were dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four and if you get  its better and  is even better And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why were doing what were doing Weve pretty much accepted the fact though that we are the women in the organization at BMW  BMW is a very manly type business  men men men its engineers And were kind of the female side to that Thats OK thats cool You go off and be manly Were going to be a little bit more female Because what were interested in is finding form thats more than just a function Were interested in finding beauty thats more than just an aesthetic its really a truth And I think this idea of soul as being at the heart of great cars is very applicable You all know it You know a car when youve seen it with soul You know how strong this is Well this experience of love and the experience of design to me are interchangeable And now Im coming to my story I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue And first of all you have to go with me for a second and say you know you could take the word love out of a lot of things in our society put the word design in and it still works like this quote here you know It kind of works you know You can understand that It works in truisms All is fair in design and war Certainly we live in a competitive society I think this one here theres a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me you know this is like you know this is like puppy love you know this is cool right Toothbrush cool It really only gets serious when you look at something like this OK This is one substitution that I believe all of us in design management are guilty of And this idea that there is more to love more to design when it gets down to your neighbor your other it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be But right now its in dealing with our own people our own teams who are doing the creating So to my story The idea of peoplework is what we work with here and I have to make a bond with my designers when were creating BMWs We have to have a shared intimacy a shared vision  that means we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way Theres good times theres interesting times and theres some stress times too You want to do cars youve got to go outside Youve got to do cars in the rain youve got to do cars in the snow Thats by the way is a presentation we made to our board of directors We haul their butts out in the snow too You want to know cars outside Well youve got to stand outside to do this And because these are artists they have very artistic temperaments All right Now one thing about art is art is discovery and art is discovering yourself through your art Right And one thing about cars is were all a little bit like Pygmalion we are completely in love with our own creations This is one of my favorite paintings it really describes our relationship with cars This is sick beyond belief But because of this the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension a new meaning We have a shared center we have a shared focus  that car stays at the middle of all our relationships And its my job in the competitive process to narrow this down I heard today about Josephs death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction You know thats what I have to do sometimes We start out with  cars we narrow it down to five cars down to three cars down to two cars down to one car and Im in the middle of that killing basically Someones love someones baby This is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this because their life is wrapped up in that too Theyve got that gene infected in them as well and they want that to live more than anything else Well this project Deep Blue put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected and I want to pass it on to you because I want you to reflect on this perhaps in your own relationships We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way wed done it that I only had a phone number that connected me to them So what we did was instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out whats the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America This is  we did this project And so we sent them off with this team name Deep Blue Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM  we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes theyd think were talking about computers It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue in a company like BMW has a hook  Deep Blue wow cool name So people get wrapped up in it And we took a team of designers and we sent them off to America And we gave them a budget what we thought was a set of deliverables a timetable and nothing else Like I said I just had a phone number that connected me to them And a group of engineers worked in Germany and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of whats the successor to the SUV They would come together compare notes Then they would work apart come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didnt pollute each others ideas  but at the same time came together and resolved the problems Hopefully really understand the customer at its heart where the customer is live with them in America So  sent the team off and actually something different happened They went other places They disappeared quite honestly and all I got was postcards Now I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls and pretty soon theyre in New York and I dont know where else And Im telling myself This is going to be a great car theyre doing research that Ive never even thought about before Right And they decided that instead of like having a studio and six or seven apartments it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylors exhouse in Malibu And  at least they told me it was her house I guess it was at one time she had a party there or something But anyway this was the house and they all lived there Now this is  living halfadozen people whod left their  some had left their wives behind and families behind and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America but the first three months were the most intensive And one of the young women in the project she was a fantastic lady she actually built her room in the bathroom The bathroom was so big she built the bed over the bathtub  its quite fascinating On the other hand I didnt know anything about this OK Nothing This is all going on and all Im getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas or whatever saying Dont worry Chris this is really going to be good OK So my concept of what a design studio was probably  I wasnt up to speed on where these guys were However the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin and you know these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer And one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings and these incredibly stressedout engineers would create some incredible solutions Well what I didnt know was and what we found out was  these guys they cant even like talk to each other under those conditions You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split in your dialog that is so deep and so far that they cannot bring this together at all And so we had our first meeting after three months in Tiburon which is just up the road from here  you know Tiburon And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr Goschel  who is now my boss and at that time he was comentor on the project  and they would present their results We would see where we were going we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America And so I had these ideas in my head that this is going to be great I mean Im going to see so much work its so intense  I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it and Im not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either  but somehow all this is going to come together and Im going to see some really great product So we went to Tiburon after three months and the team had gotten together the week before many days ahead of time The engineers flew over and designers got together with them and they put their presentation together Well it turns out that the engineers hadnt done anything And they hadnt done anything because  kind of like in car business engineers are there to solve problems and we were asking them to create a problem And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say This is the problem that weve created now help us solve it And they couldnt talk about it So what happened was the engineers showed up with nothing And the engineers told the designers If you go in with all your stuff well walk out well walk right out of the project So I didnt know any of this and we got a presentation that had an agenda looked like this There was a whole lot of dialog We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers And here Im expecting at any moment OK theyre going to turn the page and Im going to see the cars Im going to see the sketches Im going to see maybe some idea of where its going Dialog kept on going with mental maps of words and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance I was seriously being baffled with bullshit And if you can imagine what this is like to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working and theyre out there spending all this money and theyre learning and theyre doing all this stuff I went fucking ballistic right I went nuts You can probably remember Tiburon it used to look like this After four hours of this I stood up and I took this team apart I screamed at them I yelled at them What the hell are you doing Youre letting me down youre my designers youre supposed to be the creative ones what the hell is going on around here It was probably one of my better tirades I have some good ones but this was probably one of my better ones And I went into these people how could they take BMWs money how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing nothing Because of course they didnt tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings model concepts pictures  everything I wanted theyd locked up in the cars because they had shown solidarity with the engineers  and theyd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadnt realized of course that they couldnt do problem creating So we went to lunch  And Ive got to tell you this was one seriously quiet lunch The engineers all sat at one end of the table the designers and I sat at the other end of the table really quiet And I was just fucking furious furious OK Probably because they had all the fun and I didnt you know Thats what you get furious about right And somebody asked me about Catherine my wife you know did she fly out with me or something I said No and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married the priest gave a very nice sermon and he said something very important He said Love is not selfish he said Love does not mean counting how many times I say I love you It doesnt mean you had sex this many times this month and its two times less than last month so that means you dont love me as much Love is not selfish And I thought about this and I thought You know Im not showing love here Im seriously not showing love Im in the air Im in the air without trust This cannot be This cannot be that Im expecting a certain number of sketches and to me thats my quantification method for qualifying a team This cannot be So I told them this story I said Guys Im thinking about something here this isnt right I cant have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one Based on a dictate premise that says Im a boss you do what I say without trust I said This cant be Actually we all broke down into tears to be quite honest about it because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them not being able to show me what I wanted and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come And I think we felt much closer that day we cut a lot of strings that didnt need to be there and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about We put the car back at the center of our thoughts and we put love I think truly back into the center of the process By the way that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes  you see it downstairs the X Coupe  they had a lot of fun with that It was the rendition of our motorcycle the GS as Carl Magnusson says bruteiful as the idea of what could be a motorcycle if you add two more wheels And so in conclusion my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you was this one here Im also going to steal a little quote out of Little Prince Theres a lot to be said about trust and love if you know that those two words are synonymous for design I had a very very meaningful relationship with my team that day and its stayed that way ever since And I hope that you too find that theres more to design and more towards the art of the design than doing it yourself Its true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile Thanks so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,At the break I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate And this will be my only comment on it And that is I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists What Im going to tell you about in my  minutes is how were about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves Its only  years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a freeliving organism that of haemophilus influenzae That took a genome project from  years down to four months We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours So in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added most human pathogens a couple of plants several insects and several mammals including the human genome Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over  years ago was by the end of this year we might have between three and five genomes sequenced its on the order of several hundred We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence  genomes this year as a side project from environmental organisms So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed But as we look whats out there weve barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet Most people dont realize it because theyre invisible but microbes make up about a half of the Earths biomass whereas all animals only make up about one onethousandth of all the biomass And maybe its something that people in Oxford dont do very often but if you ever make it to the sea and you swallow a mouthful of seawater keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of  million viruses Less than  microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every  miles We started in Bermuda for our test project then moved up to Halifax working down the US East Coast the Caribbean Sea the Panama Canal through to the Galapagos then across the Pacific and were in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean Its very tough duty were doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science The experiments are incredibly simple We just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every  hours And with doing this weve made some amazing discoveries For example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes  there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments It turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication From one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered  million new genes and as many as  new species Weve extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation Were measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums We filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City And were in the process of sequencing all that at the present time Just on the data collection side just where we are through the Galapagos were finding that almost every  miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean Some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures  red being warm blue being cold  and we found theres a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant species The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence And these vary tremendously from region to region Maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where its mostly blue the photoreceptors tend to see blue light When theres a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light But they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data  including all of ours thus far from the expedition which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet  and it totaled around  million genes And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are Are we just discovering new members of known families or are we discovering new families And it turns out we have about  major gene families but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families So were at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes components and life on this planet When we look at the socalled evolutionary tree were up on the upper righthand corner with the animals Of those roughly  million genes we only have around  in our genome And if you take all animals together we probably share less than  and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution And we think in a genecentric view  maybe going back to Richard Dawkins ideas  than in a genomecentric view which are different constructs of these gene components Synthetic DNA the ability to synthesize DNA has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two and is getting very rapid and very cheap Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in  and that from mycoplasma genitalium And we have really nice Tshirts that say you know I heart my genitalium This is actually just a microorganism But it has roughly  genes Haemophilus had  genes And we simply asked the question if one species needs  another  is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system So we started doing transposon mutagenesis Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code And if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those nonessential genes But it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or nonessential gene based on exactly whats in the environment We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of  related organisms and we tried to compare all of those to see what they had in common And we got these overlapping circles And we found only  genes common to all  organisms The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around  or so So we think that we can expand or contract genomes depending on your point of view here to maybe  to  genes from the minimal of  The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them and we had to do this in a cassettebased fashion We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison my colleagues on this developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a base pair virus in only a twoweek period that was  percent accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology It was a quite exciting experiment  when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria This was not the first synthetic virus  a polio virus had been made a year before  but it was only one tenthousandth as active and it took three years to do This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X  This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and thats the notions that we have with biology People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee and a special committee the US government has set up to review this area And I think its important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with peoples imaginations Basically any virus thats been sequenced today  that genome can be made And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox but the DNA from this organism is not infective So even if somebody made the smallpox genome that DNA itself would not cause infections The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses And theres only two countries the US and the former Soviet Union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents If that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the knowhow to make designer viruses in the future I think singlecell organisms are possible within two years And possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade So were now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome The key is how do you put all of the others We start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome This is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about  to  hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart This organism is ubiquitous on the planet and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation The glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier Heres an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows the genome after  million rads of radiation The chromosome is literally blown apart And heres that same DNA automatically reassembled  hours later Its truly stunning that these organisms can do that and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that After these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues For example from the third organism we sequenced Methanococcus jannaschii  it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO it captures back from the environment So we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO and can capture that back So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere converting that into biopolymers or other products We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen Also theres numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products Within a short while I think theres going to be a new field called Combinatorial Genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day And therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether youre screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach Were trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen and we have an oxygeninsensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process Were also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce I think future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry Let me just close with ethical and policy studies We delayed the start of our experiments in  until we completed a yearandahalf bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species Every major religion participated in this It was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they couldnt find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be OK The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multiinstitutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area and were trying to set good examples as we go forward These are complex issues Except for the threat of bioterrorism theyre very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
7,"Music The Sound of Silence
Simon amp Garfunkel Hello voice mail my old friend Ive called for tech support again I ignored my bosss warning I called on a Monday morning Now its evening and my dinner
first grew cold and then grew mold Im still on hold Im listening to the sounds of silence I dont think you understand I think your phone lines are unmanned I punched every touch tone I was told but Ive still spent  hours on hold Its not enough your software
crashed my Mac and it constantly hangs and bombs  it erased my ROMs Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys Say your motorcycle crashes Blood comes gushing from your gashes With your fading strength you call 
and you pray for a trained MD But you get me And you listen to the sounds of silence Music Thank you Good evening and welcome to Spot the TED Presenter Who Used
to Be a Broadway Accompanist When I was offered the Times
column six years ago the deal was like this youll be sent the coolest hottest
slickest new gadgets Every week itll arrive at your door You get to try them out
play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out
before you have to send them back and youll get paid for it You can think about it if you want So Ive always been a technology nut
and I absolutely love it The job though came with one
small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address
at the end of every column And what Ive noticed is  first of all
you get an incredible amount of email If you ever are feeling lonely get a New York Times column because you will get hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of emails And the email Im getting a lot
today is about frustration People are feeling like things  Ok I just had an alarm
come up on my screen Lucky you cant see it People are feeling overwhelmed Theyre feeling like
its too much technology too fast It may be good technology but I feel like theres not enough
of a support structure Theres not enough help Theres not enough thought
put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use One time I wrote a column about my efforts
to reach Dell Technical Support and within  hours
there were  messages from readers on the feedback boards
on the Times website from users saying Me too and heres my tale of woe I call it software rage And man let me tell you whoever figures out how to make money
off of this frustration will  Oh how did that
get up there Just kidding Ok so why is the problem accelerating And part of the problem is ironically because the industry
has put so much thought into making things easier to use Ill show you what I mean This is what the computer
interface used to look like DOS Over the years its gotten easier to use This is the original Mac operating system Reagan was President
Madonna was still a brunette And the entire operating system  this is the good part  the entire
operating system fit in  k You couldnt put
the Mac OS X logo in  k So the irony is that as these
things became easier to use a less technical broader audience
was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time I once had the distinct privilege
of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day The guy had a duplicate headset
for me to listen to And the calls that 
you know how they say Your call may be recorded
for quality assurance Uhuh Your call may be recorded so that they can collect
the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD Which they do And I have a copy Its in your gift bag No no With your voices on it So some of the stories are just
so classic and yet so understandable A woman called Apple to complain
that her mouse was squeaking Making a squeaking noise And the technician said Well maam what do you mean
your mouse is squeaking She says All I can tell you
is that it squeaks louder the faster I move it across the screen And the technicians like Maam youve got the mouse
up against the screen She goes Well the message said
Click here to continue Well if you like that one 
how much time have we got Another one a guy called 
this is absolutely true  his computer had crashed
and he told the technician he couldnt restart it no matter
how many times he typed  And the technician said
What Why are you typing  He said The message says
Error Type  So we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely
at the feet of the users But why is the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerating now In the hardware world its because
we the consumers want everything to be smaller
smaller smaller So the gadgets are getting
tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially
staying the same size So it gets to be more and more
of a challenge Software is subject
to another primal force the mandate to release
more and more versions When you buy a piece of software its not like buying a vase
or a candy bar where you own it Its more like joining a club
where you pay dues every year and every year they say Weve added more features
and well sell it to you for  I know one guy whos spent 
just on Photoshop over the years And software companies make
 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox  which is that if you improve
a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it I mean Microsoft Word was last
just a word processor in you know the Eisenhower administration But whats the alternative Microsoft actually did this experiment They said Well wait a minute Everyone complains that
were adding so many features Lets create a word processor
thats just a word processor Simple pure does not do web pages
is not a database And it came out
and it was called Microsoft Write And none of you are nodding
in acknowledgment because it died It tanked No one ever bought it I call this the Sport Utility Principle People like to surround themselves
with unnecessary power right They dont need the database
and the website but theyre like Well Ill upgrade because I might
you know I might need that someday So the problem is as you add more
features where are they going to go Where are you going to stick them
You only have so many design tools You can do buttons you can do
sliders popup menus submenus But if youre not careful
about how you choose you wind up with this This is an unretouched 
this is not a joke  unretouched photo of Microsoft Word the copy that you have
with all the toolbars open Youve obviously never
opened all the toolbars but all you have to type in
is this little teeny window down here And weve arrived at the age
of interface matrices where there are so many
features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word
is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically The off switch is in there somewhere Im telling you  its there Part of the art of designing
a simple good interface is knowing when to use
which one of these features So here is the logoff
dialogue box for Windows  There are only four choices so why are they in a popup menu Its not like the rest of the screen
is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices They could have put them all out in view Heres Apples take
on the exact same dialogue box Thank you  yes I designed
the dialogue box No no Already we can see
that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent
approach to software design Microsofts approach
to simplicity tends to be lets break it down
lets just make it more steps There are these wizards everywhere And you know theres a new version
of Windows coming out this fall If they continue at this pace
theres absolutely no telling where they might wind up Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard Ok Ill bite Lets click Next to continue From the dropdown menu choose
the first letter you want to type Ok So there is a limit
that we dont want to cross So what is the answer How do you pack in all these features
in a simple intelligent way I believe in consistency when possible realworld equivalents trash can folder when possible
label things mostly But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules
if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence Now what do I mean by that Im going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something
not consistent but its better If you are buying something on the web youre supposed to put in your address and youre supposed to choose
what country youre from ok There are  countries in the world We like to think of the Internet
as a global village Im sorry its not one yet Its mainly like the United States
Europe and Japan So why is United States in the Us You have to scroll like
seven screensful to get to it Now it would be inconsistent
to put United States first but it would be intelligent This ones been touched on before but why in Gods name do you
shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called Start Heres another pet one of mine
you have a printer Most of the time you want to print
one copy of your document in page order on that printer So why in Gods name do you see
this every time you print Its like a  shuttle cockpit And one of the buttons at the bottom
youll notice is not Print Now Im not saying that Apple
is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity Palm is also especially in the old days
wonderful about this I actually got to speak to Palm
when they were flying high in the s and after the talk
I met one of the employees He says Nice talk And I said
Thank you What do you do here He said Im a tap counter
Im like Youre a what He goes Well Jeff Hawkins
the CEO says If any task on the Palm Pilot
takes more than three taps of the stylus its too long
and it has to be redesigned So Im the tap counter So Im going to show you an example of a company that does not
have a tap counter This is Microsoft Word Ok when you want to create
a new blank document in Word  it could happen You go up to the File menu
and you choose New Now what happens when you choose New Do you get a new blank document You do not On the opposite side of the monitor
a task bar appears and somewhere in those links 
by the way not at the top  somewhere in those links is a button
that makes you a new document Ok so that is a company
not counting taps You know I dont want to just stand
here and make fun of Microsoft  Yes I do The Bill Gates song Piano music Ive been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS I put my software and IBM together I got profit and they got the loss I write the code
that makes the whole world run Im getting royalties from everyone Sometimes its garbage
but the press is snowed You buy the box Ill sell the code Every software company
is doing Microsofts RampD You cant keep a good idea
down these days Even Windows is a hack Were kind of based loosely on the Mac So its big so its slow
Youve got nowhere to go Im not doing this for praise I write the code
that fits the world today Big mediocrity in every way Weve entered planet domination mode Youll have no choice youll buy my code I am Bill Gates and I write the code But actually I believe
there are really two Microsofts Theres the old one responsible
for Windows and Office Theyre dying to throw the whole thing
out and start fresh but they cant Theyre locked in because so many addons
and other company stuff locks into the old  chassis But theres also a new Microsoft thats really doing good
simple interface designs I liked the Media Center PC I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch The Wireless Watch
flopped miserably in the market but it wasnt because it wasnt
simply and beautifully designed But lets put it this way would you pay  a month to have a watch that has to be recharged
every night like your cell phone and stops working
when you leave your area code So the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch
is only going to get worse So is there any hope The screens are getting smaller
people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes things are coming out at a faster pace Its funny  when Steve Jobs
came back to Apple in  after  years away
it was the MacWorld Expo  he came to the stage
in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of did this The crowd went wild
but I had just seen  Im like where have I seen this before I had just seen the movie Evita  with Madonna and Im like you know what Ive got to do one about Steve Jobs Music It wont be easy
Youll think Im strange When I try to explain why Im back after telling the press
Apples future is black You wont believe me All that you see is a kid in his teens
who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz You try rhyming with garage Dont cry for me Cupertino The truth is I never left you I know the ropes now
know what the tricks are I made a fortune over at Pixar Dont cry for me Cupertino Ive still got the drive and vision I still wear sandals in any weather Its just that these days theyre Gucci leather Thank you So Steve Jobs had always believed
in simplicity and elegance and beauty And the truth is for years I was a little depressed because Americans
obviously did not value it because the Mac had
three percent market share Windows had  percent market share  people did not think it was worth
putting a price on it So I was a little depressed And then I heard Al Gores talk and I realized I didnt know
the meaning of depressed But it turns out I was wrong right Because the iPod came out and it violated every bit
of common wisdom Other products cost less
other products had more features they had voice recorders
and FM transmitters The other products were backed
by Microsoft with an open standard not Apples propriety standard But the iPod won 
this is the one they wanted The lesson was simplicity sells And there are signs that the industry
is getting the message This is a little company thats done
very well with simplicity and elegance The Sonos thing  its catching on Ive got just a couple examples Physically a really cool
elegant thinking coming along lately When you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures
back to your computer Well you either haul around a USB cable or you buy a card reader
and haul that around Either one youre going to lose What I do is I take out the memory card and I fold it in half
revealing USB contacts I just stick it in the computer
offload the pictures put it right back in the camera I never have to lose anything Heres another example Chris youre the source of all power
Will you be my power plug Chris Anderson Oh yeah
DP Hold that and dont let go You mightve seen this
this is Apples new laptop This the power cord
It hooks on like this And Im sure every one of you has done
this at some point in your lives or one of your children You walk along  and Im
about to pull this onto the floor I dont care Its a loaner Here we go Whoa Its magnetic  it doesnt pull
the laptop onto the floor In my very last example  I do a lot of my work
using speech recognition software And Ill just 
you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous Speech recognition
software is really great for doing emails very quickly period Like I get hundreds of them
a day period And its not just what I dictate
that it writes down period I also use this feature
called voice macros period Correct dissuade Not just Ok this is not an ideal situation because its getting the echo
from the hall and stuff The point is I can respond to people
very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out
a much longer thing So if somebody
sends me a fan letter Ill say Thanks for that Thank you so much
for taking the time to write  And conversely if somebody
sends me hate mail  which happens daily  I say Piss off I admire your frankness  So thats my dirty little secret
Dont tell anyone So the point is 
this is a really interesting story This is version eight of this software and do you know what they put
in version eight No new features Its never
happened before in software The company put no new features They just said Well make
this software work right Right Because for years people had bought
this software tried it out   percent accuracy was all they got which means one in  words is wrong  and theyd put it in their drawer And the company got sick of that so they said This version
were not going to do anything but make sure its darned accurate And so thats what they did This cult of doing things right
is starting to spread So my final advice for those of you
who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesnt work
its not necessarily you ok It could be the design
of the thing youre using Be aware in life
of good design and bad design And if youre among the people
who create this stuff Easy is hard Presweat the details for your audience Count the taps Remember the hard part
is not deciding what features to add its deciding what to leave out And best of all your motivation is
simplicity sells CA Bravo DP Thank you very much CA Hear hear ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8,Kurt Andersen Like many architects David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent  or at least pretends to be  that he asked me to question him rather than speaking In fact what were going to talk about I think is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede Dan Rather Since the September th attack on the World Trade Center many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the acre burial ground Now as CBSs Jim Axelrod reports theyre putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene Jim Axelrod Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty Theres a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest  Ground Zero Tourist Ive taken my stepdaughter here from Indianapolis This was  out of all the tourist sites in New York City  this was her numberone pick JA Thousands now line up on lower Broadway Tourist Ive been wanting to come down here since this happened JA Even on the coldest winter days To honor and remember Tourist Its reality its us It happened here This is ours JA So many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem Tourist I think that people are very frustrated that theyre not able to get closer to see whats going on JA But that is about to change In record time a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer Man Theyll get an incredible panorama and understand I think more completely the sheer totality of the destruction of the place JA If you think about it Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument people come here to see whats no longer there David Rockwell The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground JA The walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter Tourist From our hearts it affected us just as much JA The ramps are made of simple material  the kind of plywood you see at construction sites  which is really the whole point In the face of Americas worst destruction people are building again Jim Axelrod CBS News New York KA This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment but certainly David you are known as  I know a phrase you hate  an entertainment architect Your work is highly sensual even hedonistic DR I like that word KA Its about pleasure  casinos and hotels and restaurants How did the shock that all of us  and especially all of us in New York  felt on the th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing DR Well the truth of the matter is postSeptember th I felt myself in the role originally  first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated and as someone who works less than a mile from there  that I was in the role of forcing  people who work with me in my firm to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating In fact were finishing a book which is called Pleasure which is about sensual pleasure in spaces But Ive got to tell you  it became impossible to do that We were really paralyzed And I found myself the Friday after September th  two days afterwards  literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything We gave the office a few days off And in discussing this with other architects we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were  they should rebuild them  stories taller And I thought it was astonishing to speculate as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound And I had a series of discussions  first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller who collaborated with us on this and several other people  and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something And that as people who create places the ultimate way to help wasnt to pontificate or to make up scenarios but to help right now So we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design SWAT team And that was the mission that we came up with KA Were you conscious of suddenly  as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants  suddenly fulfilling needs DR Well what I was aware of was there was this overwhelming need to act now And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this There was a school PS  that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero They moved to an abandoned school We took about  or  architects and designers and artists and over four days  it was like this urban barnraising  to renovate it and everyone wanted to help It was just extraordinary Tom Otterness contributed Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us KA And that was done effectively by October  or something DR Yeah KA Obviously what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project  and this is only one of four that youve designed to surround the site  you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics DR Well its a funny thing We finished PS  and had dinner with a small group I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild And I sat in on several meetings And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with longterm infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process And it wasnt an inclusive group So we said what is  KA It was not an inclusive group DR It was not an inclusive group It was predominantly a white rich corporate group that was not representative of the city KA Shocking DR Yeah surprising So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea The city actually approached us We first approached the city about Pier  We saw how PS  worked The families  the victims of the families  were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing KA On the Hudson River DR Yeah And the city actually  through Tim Zagat initially and then through Christyne Nicholas then we got to Giuliani  said You know we dont want to do anything with Pier  right now but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that wed like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin and Ive got to say it was the most moving experience of my life It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them And there was no mediation between us and the experience There was no filter And I remembered on September th on th Street the roof of our building  we can see the World Trade Towers prominently  and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up And then everyone was up on the roof so I ran up there And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience So seeing this in a very simple dignified way was a very powerful experience So we went back to the city and said were not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform but weve spent some time down there At the same time the city had this need They were looking for a solution to deal with  or  thousand people a day who were going down there that had nowhere to go And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan There was a way  there had to be a way  to get people to move around the site KA But then youve got to figure out a way  we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board  but simply funding this thing It looks like a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar project DR Well we knew that if it wasnt privately funded it wasnt going to happen And we also frankly knew that if it didnt happen by the end of the Giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the  we were meeting with  or  people with the city at a time and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management This incredible act on their part because they really wanted this and they sensed that this needed to happen KA And there was therefore this ticking clock because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that DR Yeah So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this  we had to work with the families of the victims through the city to make sure that they knew this was happening Because this didnt want to be a surprise And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to do this even if we would pay him the money There needed to be a foundation in place So we came up with a foundation and actually what happened was one major developer in New York  KA Who shall remain nameless I guess DR Yeah His initials are JS and he owns Rockefeller Center if that helps anyone  volunteered to help And we met with him The prices from the contractors were between five to  dollars And AtlanticHeydt whos the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost So this developer said You know what well underwrite the entire expense And we said Thats incredible And I think this was the st and we knew this had to be built and up by the th And we had to start construction the next day We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it KA Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge I guess DR In fact it was as if this was going to be windowwashing scaffolding There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul  that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified and a place to reflect and remember And Ive got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul  which is just to the right  and moving around the site And I live down there so we spent a lot of time looking at the need And I think people were amazed at two things  I think they were amazed at the destruction but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said Im going to lock the door because this developer will not agree to have you leave till youve signed off on this And we said Well this is half the size it doesnt have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone  everyone in the city Wed have to go back to the beginning to do this And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding So we didnt know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net We emailed out letters to as many people as we could  several people in the audience here  who were very helpful KA There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point DR No In fact I told the contractor to go ahead He had already ordered materials based on my goahead We knew that one way or another this was going to happen And we just felt it had to happen KA You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation Richard I think very correctly made the point at the beginning  before all the chair designers came out  about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal banal common problem of sitting It seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that This was an unprecedented singular design problem DR Well heres the issue we knew that this was not in the sense of  we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial That this was a place for people to reflect to remember  a kind of quiet place So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer  as we said about the families platform  and the experience as possible Its all incredibly humble material Its scaffolding and plywood And it allows  by sort of the procession of the movement up by Saint Pauls and down the other side  it gives you about  feet to go up  feet from the ground to where you get the  degree view But the design was driven by a need to be quick cheap safe respectful flexible One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site one of which is an upgrade of the families platform we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is KA Your work  I mean weve talked about this before  a lot of your work I think is informed by your belief in or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die sort of sense of existence This is clearly not a work for the ages You know a couple of years this thing isnt going to be here Did that require as an architect a new way of thinking about what you were doing To think of it as this purely temporary installation DR No I dont think so I think this is obviously substantially different from anything wed ever thought about doing before just by the nature of it Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is number one  the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done And Kevin Kennon Rick Scofidio Liz Diller and all the people within the city  Norman Lear who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it So the notion of collaboration  I think this reinforces how important that is And in terms of the temporary nature of it our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about whats really happening there And a day or two before it opened was Giulianis farewell address where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial Which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter I think makes it a more powerful dialogue And thats what we were interested in So that very much is in the realm of things Ive been interested in before KA It seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure It enables that conversation to get serious And six months after the fact  and only a few months away from the site being cleaned  we are very quickly now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious Do you have  having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project  have any ideas about what should or shouldnt be done DR Well I think one thing that shouldnt be done is evaluate  I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings KA But it had some really terrible ideas DR And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses And I think there should be a broader  which theres starting to be  the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that its going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion Theres a few discussions right now that I think are very positive about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over so that theres one uninterrupted piece of land KA Well I think thats interesting And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago but perhaps isnt now which is not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza Is this an opportunity is the silver lining  a silver lining here  to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not DR I think theres a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day I dont think it has much to do with  or  or  or  thousand new office spaces regardless of what the number is So yeah I think there is a chance to relook at how we think about cities And in fact theres a proposal on the table now for building number seven KA Which was the building just north of the Towers DR Right which the towers fell into And the reason thats been held up is essentially by community outrage that theyre not reopening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city I think a public dialogue  I think you know Id like to see an international competition and a call for ideas for uses KA Whether its arts whether its housing whether its what amount of shopping DR Right And were looking for other things This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting  architects who currently dont have a voice in New York to do artist housing And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about a multiplicity of things KA Before we end I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform DR John Kamen  whos here actually  put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use So I thought that would be good to end with DR Were looking from Fulton Street west One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how antigraffiti he was And essentially our structure was designed to be written on KA As you say its not a memorial But were you conscious of memorials The Vietnam Memorial Those kinds of forms DR We certainly did as much research as we could and we were conscious of other memorials And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do Its  people on the committee for Oklahoma City which is why we thought of this as a sort of adhoc spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were adhoc memorials in the city already The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is demountable Whats interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed so that what youre aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero but all of the buildings around it  and the scars on the building around it which are enormous This shows Saint Pauls on the left KA I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished is part of its extraordinary  I dont know if beauty is the word  but presence DR It was an honor to do And we were thrilled to be able to show it here ,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
9,As you pointed out every time you come here you learn something This morning the worlds experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats I think concluded that ultimately the solution is people shouldnt sit down I could have told them that Yesterday the automotive guys gave us some new insights They pointed out that I believe it was between  and  years from today they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff Thats reassuring They then pointed out that thered be sort of the other controls by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff Thats pretty good but why not get rid of the wires Then you dont need anything to control the car except thinking about it I would love to talk about the technology and sometime in whats past the  minutes Ill be happy to talk to all the technogeeks around here about whats in here But if I had one thing to say about this before we get to first it would be that from the time we started building this the big idea wasnt the technology It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community The big idea here is I think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation And maybe to put that in perspective theres so much data on this Ill be happy to give it to you in different forms You never know what strikes the fancy of whom but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world And Henry Ford just about  years ago started cranking out Model Ts What I dont think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied For instance in that time  percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns So the car  the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage  was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage It was half as long And it was an environmental improvement because for instance in  they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm or their farm to a town or from a town to a city It all made sense with  percent of the people living there By the s we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world the highway system And it is certainly a wonder And by the way as I take shots at old technologies I want to assure everybody and particularly the automotive industry  whos been very supportive of us  that I dont think this in any way competes with airplanes or cars But think about where the world is today  percent of the global population now lives in cities Thats  billion people Weve solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today  years ago sailing ships started getting reliable enough we found a new continent  years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country Over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the  years weve connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that But during that entire process more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving to cities China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half And so nobody I think would argue that airplanes in the last  years have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood And if you just look at how technology has been applied weve solved all the longrange highspeed highvolume largeweight problems of moving things around Nobody would want to give them up And I certainly wouldnt want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my Humvee or my Porsche I love them all I dont keep any of them in my living room The fact is the last mile is the problem and half the world now lives in dense cities And people spend depending on who they are between  and  percent of their energy getting around on foot I think theres  I dont know what data would impress you but how about  percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices particularly sitting in cities And again I say that not to attack any industry I think  I really do  I love my airplane and cars on highways moving  miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient both from an engineering point of view an energy consumption point of view and a utility point of view And we all love our cars and I do The problem is you get into the city and you want to go four blocks its neither fun nor efficient nor productive Its not sustainable If  in China in the year   million people used bicycles  million people used cars If five percent of that population became quote middle class and wanted to go the way weve gone in the last hundred years at the same time that  percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan every six weeks  it isnt sustainable environmentally it isnt sustainable economically  there just aint enough oil  and its not sustainable politically I mean what are we fighting over right now We can make it complicated but whats the world fighting over right now So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile and it was dumb luck We were working on iBOTs but once we made this we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis You dont need the water Or snowmobiles You dont need the snow Or skiing Its just fun and people love to move around doing fun things And every one of those industries by the way  just golf carts alone is a multibilliondollar industry But rather than go license this off which is what we normally do it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology but into an understanding of a world thats solved all its other problems but has somehow come to accept that cities  which right back from ancient Greece on were meant to walk around cities that were architected and built for people  now have a footprint that while weve solved every other transportation problem  and its like Moores law I mean look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon then on a railroad then an airplane Every other form of transportations been improved In  years weve gone backwards in getting around cities Theyve gotten bigger theyre spread out The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city  Wilshire Boulevard or Fifth Avenue or Tokyo or Paris  the most expensive real estate is their downtowns  percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars The  largest cities in the world So you wonder what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities What if you could make them fun attractive clean environmentally friendly What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this as that last link to mass transit to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want and then have our cities energized again We thought it would be really neat to do that and one of the problems we really were worried about is how do we get legal on the sidewalk Because technically Ive got motors Ive got wheels  Im a motor vehicle I dont look like a motor vehicle I have the same footprint as a pedestrian I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space I took this down to Ground Zero and knocked my way through crowds for an hour Im a pedestrian But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and if we get told we dont belong on the sidewalk we have two choices Were a recreational vehicle that doesnt really matter and I dont spend my time doing that kind of stuff Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle Weve been so concerned about that we went to the Postmaster General of the United States as the first person we ever showed on the outside and said Put your people on it Everybody trusts their postman And they belong on the sidewalks and theyll use it seriously He agreed We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat carrying  pounds of stuff They love it And I cant believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket So weve been working really really hard but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about whats important and how to apply the technology We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted So Im happy really I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want And yes its really fun and yes you should all go out and try it But if I could ask you to do one thing its not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine that although we all understand somehow that its reasonable that we use our pound machine which can go  miles an hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow its also what we used for the last mile and its broken and it doesnt work One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted happened out here in California A few weeks ago after we launched it we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach zipping up and back and hes marveling at the technology and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by and skateboarders are zipping by and a little old lady  I mean if you looked in the dictionary a little old lady  came by me  and now that Im on this Im the height of a normal adult now  and she just stops and the camera is there and she looks up at me and says Can I try that And what was I  you know how are you going to say anything And so I said Sure So I get off and she gets on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turns around and she goes about  feet and she turns back around and shes all smiles And she comes back to me and she stops and she says Finally they made something for us And the camera is looking down at her Im thinking Wow that was great   please lady dont say another word And the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said What do you mean by that And I figured Its all over now and she looks up and she says Well shes still watching these guys go she says I cant ride a bike no she says I cant use a skateboard and Ive never used roller blades she knew them by name she says And its been  years since I rode a bicycle Then she looks up shes looking up and she says And Im  years old and I dont drive a car anymore I still have to get to the store and I cant carry a lot of things And it suddenly occurred to me that among my many fears were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it  it was that fundamentally you believe theres pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left the sidewalks in these cities When you look at the  inches of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the parked car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet  its  that little piece is all thats there But she looks up and says this and it occurs to me well kids arent going to mind these things and they dont vote and business people and then young adults arent going to mind these things  theyre pretty cool  so I guess subliminally I was worried that its the older population thats going to worry So having seen this and having worried about it for eight years the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys call AARP get an appointment right away Weve got to show them this thing And they took it to Washington they showed them and theyre going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities like Atlanta where were doing trials to see if it really can in fact help reenergize their downtown The bottom line is whether you believe the United Nations or any of the other think tanks  in the next  years all human population growth on this planet will be in cities In Asia alone it will be over a billion people They learned to start with cell phones They didnt have to take the year trip we took They start at the top of the technology food chain Weve got to start building cities and human environments where a pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense rich greenspace environment without being in a pound machine to do it Cars were not meant for parallel parking theyre wonderful machines to go between cities but just think about it weve solved all the longrange highspeed problems The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals You do it in your sneakers Not much has changed If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking  three times  a minute walk becomes  minutes Your choice when living in a city if its now  minutes  because at  minutes you want an alternative whether its a bus a train  weve got to build an infrastructure  a light rail  or youre going to keep parking those cars But if you could put a pin in most cities and imagine how far you could if you had the time walk in one halfhour its the city If you could make it fun and make it eight or  minutes you cant find your car unpark your car move your car repark your car and go somewhere you cant get to a cab or a subway We could change the way people allocate their resources the way this planet uses its energy make it more fun And were hoping to some extent history will say we were right Thats Segway This is a Stirling cycle engine this had been confused by a lot of things were doing This little beast right now is producing a few hundred watts of electricity Yes it could be attached to this and yes on a kilogram of propane you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is itll burn any fuel because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact where most of the world you cant simply plug into your volt outlet Weve been working on this actually as an alternative energy source starting way back with Johnson amp Johnson to run an iBOT because the best batteries you could get   watthours per kilogram in lead  watthours per kilogram nickelcadmium  watthours per kilogram in nickelmetal hydride  watthours per kilogram in lithium  watthours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline  which is why nobody drives electric cars But in any event if you can burn it with the same efficiency  because its external combustion  as your kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turns out to be pretty neat It makes just enough electricity to for instance do this which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as Mr Holly  Dr Holly  pointed out can run computers and a light bulb But more interestingly the thermodynamics of this say youre never going to get more than  percent efficiency It doesnt matter much  it says if you get  watts of electricity youll get  or  watts of heat If you wanted to boil water and recondense it at a rate of  gallons an hour it takes about  a little over  kilowatt   watts of continuous power  to do it Thats so much energy you couldnt afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way Certainly in the rest of the world your choice is to devastate the place turning everything that will burn into heat or drink the water thats available The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water Depending on whose numbers you believe its between  and  people per day We dont need sophisticated heart transplants around the world We need water And women shouldnt have to spend four hours a day looking for it or watching their kids die We figured out how to put a vaporcompression distiller on this thing with a counterflow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for  watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat it will make  gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it So if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a solution to transportation electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs  pounds I dont know but well try it I better shut up

10,"With all the legitimate concerns
about AIDS and avian flu  and well hear about that from the brilliant Dr Brilliant later today  I want to talk about the other
pandemic which is cardiovascular disease
diabetes hypertension  all of which are completely
preventable for at least  percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle And whats happening is that theres a globalization of illness
occurring that people are starting to eat like us
and live like us and die like us And
in one generation for example Asias gone from having
one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity
and diabetes to one of the highest And in Africa
cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries So theres a critical
window of opportunity we have to make an important
difference that can affect the lives of literally
millions of people and practice preventive
medicine on a global scale Heart and blood vessel
diseases still kill more people  not only in this
country but also worldwide  than everything
else combined and yet its completely preventable
for almost everybody Its not only preventable its actually reversible And for the last
almost  years weve been able to show
that by simply changing diet and lifestyle using
these very hightech expensive stateoftheart
measures to prove how powerful these very simple
and lowtech and lowcost interventions can be like  quantitative arteriography
before and after a year and cardiac PET scans We showed a few months
ago  we published the first study showing you
can actually stop or reverse the progression
of prostate cancer by making changes in diet
and lifestyle and  percent regression in the tumor
growth or inhibition of the tumor growth compared
to only nine percent in the control group And in the MRI and MR
spectroscopy here the prostate tumor activity
is shown in red  you can see it diminishing after a year Now there is an epidemic
of obesity twothirds of adults and  percent of kids
Whats really concerning to me is that diabetes has
increased  percent in the past  years and this may be the first generation in which our kids
live a shorter life span than we do Thats pitiful and its preventable Now these are not election
returns these are the people  the number
of the people who are obese by state beginning in 
   these are from the CDC website 
     you get a new category 
         
 it gets worse Were kind of devolving Laughter Now what can we do about this
Well you know the diet that weve found
that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet But the people in Asia
are starting to eat like we are which is why theyre
starting to get sick like we are So Ive been working
with a lot of the big food companies They can make
it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient
to eat healthier foods like  I chair the advisory
boards to McDonalds and PepsiCo and ConAgra
and Safeway and soon Del Monte and theyre
finding that its good business The salads that you see
at McDonalds came from the work  theyre going
to have an Asian salad At Pepsi twothirds
of their revenue growth came from their better foods And so if we can do that
then we can free up resources for buying drugs
that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV
and malaria and for preventing avian flu Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
11,Good morning everyone First of all its been fantastic being here over these past few days And secondly I feel its a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people these amazing talks that weve had I feel that Ive fitted in in many ways to some of the things that Ive heard I came directly here from the deep deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador where I was out  you could only get there by a plane  with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies and keep the roads out of their forests Theyre fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world thats clean a world that isnt contaminated a world that isnt polluted And what was so amazing to me and what fits right in with what were all talking about here at TED is that there right in the middle of this rainforest was some solar panels  the first in that part of Ecuador  and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldnt have to go down The water was cleaned but because they got a lot of batteries they were able to store a lot of electricity So every house  and there were I think eight houses in this little community  could have light for I think it was about half an hour each evening And there is the Chief in all his regal finery with a laptop computer And this man he has been outside but hes gone back and he was saying You know we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era and we didnt even know about the white man  years ago and now here we are with laptop computers and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world We want to know about health care We want to know about what other people do  were interested in it And we want to learn other languages We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese and were good at languages So there he is with his little laptop computer but fighting against the might of the pressures  because of the debt the foreign debt of Ecuador  fighting the pressure of World Bank IMF and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil And so coming directly from there to here But of course my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization  I cant really call it a civilization A different way of life a different being Weve talked earlier  this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world  but the world is not composed only of human beings there are also other animal beings And I propose to bring into this TED conference as I always do around the world the voice of the animal kingdom Too often we just see a few slides or a bit of film but these beings have voices that mean something And so I want to give you a greeting as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ive been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since  During that time there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work For example for the first time a few years ago by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed  to have DNA profiling done  so for the first time we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society So this opens up a whole new avenue of research And we use GSI  geographic whatever it is GSI  to determine the range of the chimps And were using  you can see that Im not really into this kind of stuff  but were using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area And of course theres developments in infrared so you can watch animals at night and equipment for recording by video and tape recording is getting lighter and better So in many many ways we can do things today that we couldnt do when I began in  Especially when chimpanzees and other animals with large brains are studied in captivity modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these nonhuman animals So that we know today theyre capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan  her name means love  and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her She loves her computer  shell leave her big group and her running water and her trees and everything And shell come in to sit at this computer  its like a video game for a kid shes hooked Shes  by the way and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans She does very complex tasks and I havent got time to go into them but the amazing thing about this female is she doesnt like making mistakes If she has a bad run and her score isnt good shell come and reach up and tap on the glass  because she cant see the experimenter  which is asking to have another go And her concentration  shes already concentrated hard for  minutes or so and now she wants to do it all over again just for the satisfaction of having done it better And the food is not important  she does get a tiny reward like one raisin for a correct response  but she will do it for nothing if you tell her beforehand So here we are a chimpanzee using a computer Chimpanzees gorillas orangutans also learn human sign language But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in   I remember so well so vividly as though it was yesterday  the first time when I was going through the vegetation the chimpanzees were still running away from me for the most part although some were a little bit acclimatized  and I saw this dark shape hunched over a termite mound and I peered with my binoculars It was fortunately one adult male whom Id named David Greybeard  and by the way science at that time was telling me that I shouldnt name the chimps they should all have numbers that was more scientific Anyway David Greybeard  and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest And not only that  he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves  modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose  the beginning of toolmaking The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time it was thought that humans and only humans used and made tools When I was at school we were defined as man the toolmaker So that when Louis Leakey my mentor heard this news he said Ah we must now redefine man redefine tool or accept chimpanzees as humans We now know that at Gombe alone there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes Moreover we know that in different parts of Africa wherever chimps have been studied there are completely different toolusing behaviors And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next through observation imitation and practice  that is a definition of human culture What we find is that over these odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes and as I say other mammals with complex brains and social systems we have found that after all there isnt a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom Its a very wuzzy line Its getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we in our arrogance used to think was just human The chimps  theres no time to discuss their fascinating lives  but they have this long childhood five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother and then another three four or five years of emotional dependence on her even when the next child is born The importance of learning in that time when behavior is flexible  and theres an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society The longterm affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother with the brothers and sisters and which can last through a lifetime which may be up to  years They can actually live longer than  in captivity so weve only done  years in the wild so far And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism We find in their nonverbal communication  this is very rich  they have a lot of sounds which they use in different circumstances but they also use touch posture gesture and what do they do They kiss they embrace they hold hands They pat one another on the back they swagger they shake their fist  the kind of things that we do and they do them in the same kind of context They have very sophisticated cooperation Sometimes they hunt  not that often but when they hunt they show sophisticated cooperation and they share the prey We find that they show emotions similar to  maybe sometimes the same  as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness sadness fear despair They know mental as well as physical suffering And I dont have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you save to say that there are very bright students in the best universities studying emotions in animals studying personalities in animals We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors  self as opposed to other They have a sense of humor and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives But this teaches us a new respect  and its a new respect not only for the chimpanzees I suggest but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet Once were prepared to admit that after all were not the only beings with personalities minds and above all feelings and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient sapient creatures on this planet it really gives cause for deep shame at least for me So the sad thing is that these chimpanzees  whove perhaps taught us more than any other creature a little humility  are in the wild disappearing very fast Theyre disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well The deforestation the growth of human populations needing more land Theyre disappearing because some timber companies go in with clearcutting Theyre disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads  as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched  to take out oil or timber And this has led in Congo basin and other parts of the world to what is known as the bushmeat trade This means that although for hundreds perhaps thousands of years people have lived in those forests or whatever habitat it is in harmony with their world just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families  now suddenly because of the roads the hunters can go in from the towns They shoot everything every single thing that moves thats bigger than a small rat they sundry it or smoke it And now theyve got transport they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it And people will pay more for bushmeat as its called than for domestic meat  its culturally preferred And its not sustainable and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin whove lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted Theyre given weapons they shoot for the logging camps they get money Their culture is being destroyed along with the animals upon whom they depend So when the logging camp moves theres nothing left We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity and Ive seen it happening with my own eyes And the grim picture in Africa  I love Africa and what do we see in Africa We see deforestation we see the desert spreading we see massive hunger we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support and theyre too poor to buy food from elsewhere Were the people that we heard about yesterday on the Easter Island who cut down their last tree  were they stupid Didnt they know what was happening Of course but if youve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isnt a question of Lets leave the tree for tomorrow How am I going to feed my family today Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer and then well pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end So this is a pretty grim picture The one thing we have which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures is this sophisticated spoken language  a language with which we can tell children about things that arent here We can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future discuss ideas with each other so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group We can do it by talking to each other we can do it through video we can do it through the written word And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards and were destroying the world In the developed world in a way its worse because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what were doing Do you know were bringing little babies into a world where in many places the water is poisoning them And the air is harming them and the food thats grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them And thats not just in the faraway developing world thats everywhere Do you know we all have about  chemicals in our bodies we didnt have about  years ago And so many of these diseases like asthma and certain kinds of cancers are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped Were harming ourselves around the world as well as harming the animals as well as harming nature herself  Mother Nature that brought us into being Mother Nature where I believe we need to spend time where theres trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development And yet there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature because theyre growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun or in the forest with the dappled sunspecks coming down from the canopy above As I was traveling around the world you know I had to leave the forest  thats where I love to be I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because finding they dwindled from about two million  years ago to about  now I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world And the more I talked about the chimpanzees plight the more I realized the fact that everythings interconnected and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world and everything was joining together and making  not sense hope lies in sense you said  its making a nonsense How can we do it Somebody said that yesterday And as I was traveling around I kept meeting young people whod lost hope They were feeling despair they were feeling Well it doesnt matter what we do eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die Everything is hopeless  were always being told so by the media And then I met some who were angry and anger that can turn to violence and were all familiar with that And I have three little grandchildren and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university theyd say Were angry or Were filled with despair because we feel youve compromised our future and theres nothing we can do about it And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren and think how much weve harmed this planet since I was their age I feel this deep shame and thats why in  in Tanzania I started a program thats called Roots and Shoots Theres little brochures all around outside and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future I beg that you pick up that brochure And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope Roots make a firm foundation Shoots seem tiny but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls See the brick walls as all the problems that weve inflicted on this planet Then you see it is a message of hope Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference Every individual has a role to play Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday and you scientists know that you cant actually  even if you stay in bed all day youre breathing oxygen and giving out CO and probably going to the loo and things like that  youre making a difference in the world So the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects And these are projects to make the world around them a better place One project to show care and concern for your own human community One for animals including domestic animals  and I have to say I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog Rusty who was my childhood companion And the third kind of project something for the local environment So what the kids do depends first of all how old are they  and we go now from preschool right through university Its going to depend whether theyre innercity or rural Its going to depend if theyre wealthy or impoverished Its going to depend which part say of America theyre in Were in every state now and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York Its going to depend on which country theyre in  and were already in plus countries with about  active groups  and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that Ive never even heard of because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves Why Because theyre buying into it and theyre the ones who get to decide what theyre going to do It isnt something that their parents tell them or their teachers tell them Thats effective but if they decide themselves We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories We want to go and work in a dog shelter We want to learn about animals We want   You know it goes on and on and this is very hopeful for me As I travel around the world  days a year everywhere theres a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying Look at the difference weve made And now comes the technology into it because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world And if anyone is interested to help us weve got so many ideas but we need help  we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement But also  and this is so important  to communicate their despair to say Weve tried this and it doesnt work and what shall we do And then lo and behold theres another group answering these kids who may be in America or maybe this is a group in Israel saying Yeah you did it a little bit wrong This is how you should do it The philosophy is very simple We do not believe in violence No violence no bombs no guns Thats not the way to solve problems Violence leads to violence at least in my view So how do we solve The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding Know the facts but see how they fit in the big picture Hard work and persistence dont give up  and love and compassion leading to respect for all life How many more minutes Two one Chris Anderson One  one to two Jane Goodall Two two Im going to take two Are you going to come and drag me off Anyway  so basically Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young peoples lives Its what Im devoting most of my energy to And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact not just because you can share technology with us but because so many of you have children And if you take this program out and give it to your children they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good because theyve got parents like you And its been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place Its very encouraging But the kids do ask me  and this wont take more than two minutes I promise  the kids say Dr Jane do you really have hope for the future You travel you see all these horrible things happening Firstly the human brain  I dont need to say anything about that Now that we know what the problems are around the world human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems And weve talked a lot about that Secondly the resilience of nature We can destroy a river and we can bring it back to life We can see a whole area desolated and it can be brought back to bloom again with time or a little help And thirdly the last speaker talked about  or the speaker before last talked about the indomitable human spirit We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible Nelson Mandela  I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison where he labored for  years and came out with so little bitterness he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath Even after the th of September  and I was in New York and I felt the fear  nevertheless there was so much human courage so much love and so much compassion And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear  the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldnt worry about the environment any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic  and I was trying to encourage them somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi If you look back through human history you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good And just after that a woman brought me this little bell and I want to end on this note She said If youre talking about hope and peace ring this This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine from the killing fields of Pol Pot  one of the most evil regimes in human history  where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled So yes there is hope and where is the hope Is it out there with the politicians Its in our hands Its in your hands and my hands and those of our children Its really up to us Were the ones who can make a difference If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and dont buy the things that are not we can change the world overnight Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
12,Thank you Its really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager Today I want to talk to you about the future but first Im going to tell you a bit about the past My story starts way before I was born My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz the death camp And she was going along the tracks and the tracks split And somehow  we dont really know exactly the whole story  but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp My grandmother survived and married my grandfather They were living in Hungary and my mother was born And when my mother was two years old the Hungarian revolution was raging and they decided to escape Hungary They got on a boat and yet another divergence  the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia They got on and didnt know where they were going and ended up in Canada So to make a long story short they came to Canada My grandmother was a chemist She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto and at  she died of stomach cancer I never met my grandmother but I carry on her name  her exact name Eva Vertes  and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion too I found this passion not far from here actually when I was nine years old My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon And I had never been a reader when I was young  my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys I tried Nancy Drew I tried all that  and I just didnt like reading books And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called The Hot Zone It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus And something about it just kind of drew me towards it There was this big sort of bumpylooking virus on the cover and I just wanted to read it I picked up that book and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur and to actually here where we are today in Monterey I read that book and from when I was reading that book I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine I wanted to be like the explorers Id read about in the book who went into the jungles of Africa went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was So from that moment on I read every medical book I could get my hands on and I just loved it so much I was a passive observer of the medical world It wasnt until I entered high school that I thought Maybe now you know  being a big high school kid  I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world I was  and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab And hardly anyone responded But I mean why would they respond to a yearold anyway And I got to go talk to one professor Dr Jacobs who accepted me into the lab At that time I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology  specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system So I started that and worked in his lab for a year and found the results that I guess youd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals  that it really really impaired the nervous system The spinal cord had breaks The neurons were crossing in every which way And from then I wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment So thats what led me to Alzheimers I started reading about Alzheimers and tried to familiarize myself with the research and at the same time when I was in the  I was reading in the medical library one day and I read this article about something called purine derivatives And they seemed to have cell growthpromoting properties And being naive about the whole field I kind of thought Oh you have cell death in Alzheimers which is causing the memory deficit and then you have this compound  purine derivatives  that are promoting cell growth And so I thought Maybe if it can promote cell growth it can inhibit cell death too And so thats the project that I pursued for that year and its continuing now as well and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately  percent So I presented those results at the International Science Fair which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life And there I was awarded Best in the World in Medicine which allowed me to get in or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world And from then on since I was now in this huge exciting world I wanted to explore it all I wanted it all at once but knew I couldnt really get that And I stumbled across something called cancer stem cells And this is really what I want to talk to you about today  about cancer At first when I heard of cancer stem cells I didnt really know how to put the two together Id heard of stem cells and Id heard of them as the panacea of the future  the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps But Id heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together Last summer I worked at Stanford University doing some research on cancer stem cells And while I was doing this I was reading the cancer literature trying to  again  familiarize myself with this new medical field And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell This fascinated me The more I read the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury If you smoke you damage your lung tissue and then lung cancer arises If you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs And it was really interesting  there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises Because what stem cells are  theyre these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue So if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then its initiating cancer its almost as if this is a repair response And the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged we need to repair the lung And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair  because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue But its almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response but cant quite control it It hasnt yet become finetuned enough to finish what has been initiated So this really really fascinated me And I really think that we cant think about cancer  let alone any disease  in such blackandwhite terms If we eliminate cancer the way were trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation were bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it Its almost as if were getting back to this starting point Were removing the cancer cells but were revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix Shouldnt we think about manipulation rather than elimination If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate  to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue whatever that cancer has been put there to do  it would be a repair process Wed end up better than we were before cancer So this really changed my view of looking at cancer And while I was reading all these articles about cancer it seemed that the articles  a lot of them  focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer  tracking the cancer through the body tracing where it is where it goes But it struck me that Id never heard of cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter And skeletal muscle constitutes  percent of our body or over  percent of our body And so at first I kind of thought Well maybe theres some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesnt get cancer  at least not that I know of So I looked further into it found as many articles as I could and it was amazing  because it turned out that it was very rare Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer and furthermore not only to cancer but of metastases going to skeletal muscle And what metastases are is when the tumor  when a piece  breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ Thats what a metastasis is Its the part of cancer that is the most dangerous If cancer was localized we could likely remove it or somehow  you know its contained Its very contained But once it starts moving throughout the body thats when it becomes deadly So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles but cancer didnt seem to go to skeletal muscle  there seemed to be something here So these articles were saying you know Skeletal  metastasis to skeletal muscle  is very rare But it was left at that No one seemed to be asking why So I decided to ask why At first  the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology and pretty much said Hey it seems like cancer doesnt really go to skeletal muscle Is there a reason for this And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue Meaning that you have muscle cells but theyre not dividing so it doesnt seem like a good target for cancer to hijack But then again this fact that the metastases didnt go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely And furthermore that nervous tissue  brain  gets cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated So I decided to ask why And heres some of I guess my hypotheses that Ill be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami And I guess Ill keep investigating until I get the answers But I know that in science once you get the answers inevitably youre going to have more questions So I guess you could say that Ill probably be doing this for the rest of my life Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle theres a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels And you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases So first of all I thought you know Wouldnt it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle And as well cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow Without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and its not harmful So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this trying to figure out why cancer doesnt go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported  percent of micrometastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy  percent Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle but only  percent of actual metastases  suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels We use skeletal muscles so much Its the one portion of our body  our hearts always beating Were always moving our muscles Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply It needs to be constantly contracting so therefore its almost selfish Its grabbing its blood vessels for itself Therefore when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue it cant get a blood supply and cant grow So this suggests that maybe if there is an antiangiogenic factor in skeletal muscle  or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow  this could be a potential future therapy for cancer And another thing thats really interesting is that theres this whole  the way tumors move throughout the body its a very complex system  and theres something called the chemokine network And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants and theyre the stop and go signals for cancer So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ  a distant organ somewhere in the body  will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesnt express this type of molecules And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle  theres been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured thats what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle And furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured thats what causes chemokines  these signals saying Cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors  it causes them to highly express these chemokines So theres so much interplay here I mean there are so many possibilities for why tumors dont go to skeletal muscle But it seems like by investigating by attacking cancer by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something  theres got to be something  thats making this tissue resistant to tumors And can we utilize  can we take this property this compound this receptor whatever it is thats controlling these antitumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general Now one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer  to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body  is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called MyoD And what MyoD essentially does is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells So this compound MyoD has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells So is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why it seems as if it is so rare Its not harmful it has just repaired the muscle Muscle is constantly being used  constantly being damaged If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way cancer occurred  I mean everybody would have cancer almost And I hate to say that But it seems as though muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury to finetune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish I really believe that the human body is very very smart and we cant counteract something the body is saying to do Its different when a bacteria comes into the body  thats a foreign object  we want that out But when the body is actually initiating a process and were calling it a disease it doesnt seem as though elimination is the right solution So even to go from there its possible although farfetched that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating  for example Alzheimers where the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells  what if we could in the future use cancer A tumor  put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells Thats a very farfetched idea but I really believe that it may be possible These cells are so versatile these cancer cells are so versatile  we just have to manipulate them in the right way And again some of these may be farfetched but I figured if theres anywhere to present farfetched ideas its here at TED so thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
13,Frank Gehry I listened to this scientist this morning Dr Mullis was talking about his experiments and I realized that I almost became a scientist When I was  my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water So I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in And the glass  luckily I turned around  I had it all in my back and I was about  feet away The wall was covered with  I had an explosion Richard Saul Wurman Really FG People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay RSW  huh Laughter Id like to start this session again The gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous Frank Gehry And Frank youve come to a place in your life which is astonishing I mean it is astonishing for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time I mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because its a funny  you know its a strange thought but your building is an icon  you can draw a little picture of that building it can be used in ads  and youve had not rock star status but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life And I know the road was extremely difficult And it didnt seem at least that your sell outs whatever they were were very big You kept moving ahead in a life where youre dependent on working for somebody But thats an interesting thing for a creative person A lot of us work for people were in the hands of other people And thats one of the great dilemmas  were in a creativity session  its one of the great dilemmas in creativity how to do work thats big enough and not sell out And youve achieved that and that makes your win doubly big triply big Its not quite a question but you can comment on it Its a big issue FG Well Ive always just  Ive never really gone out looking for work I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head And when I started out I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff And I realized when Id come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look at me like Id just landed from Mars But I couldnt do anything else That was my response to the people in the time And actually it was responding to clients that I had who didnt have very much money so they couldnt afford very much I think it was circumstantial Until I got to my house where the client was my wife We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like  grand I built a house around it And a few people got excited about it I was visiting with an artist Michael Heizer out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere Hes building this huge concrete place And it was late in the evening Wed had a lot to drink We were standing out in the desert all alone and thinking about my house he said Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent somewhere in  years somebodys going to like it So I thought Yeah thats probably a good idea Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money so the stuff was a little more permanent But I just found out the world aint going to last that long this guy was telling us the other day So where do we go now Back to  everythings so temporary I dont see it the way you characterized it For me every day is a new thing I approach each project with a new insecurity almost like the first project I ever did and I get the sweats I go in and start working Im not sure where Im going  if I knew where I was going I wouldnt do it When I can predict or plan it I dont do it I discard it So I approach it with the same trepidation Obviously over time I have a lot more confidence that its going to be OK I do run a kind of a business  Ive got  people and youve got to pay them so theres a lot of responsibility involved  but the actual work on the project is with I think a healthy insecurity And like the playwright said the other day  I could relate to him youre not sure When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it I saw all the mistakes I saw  They werent mistakes I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it I felt an embarrassment  How could I have done that How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that Its taken several years to now look at it detached and say  as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street and it appears to have a relationship  that I started to like it RSW Whats the status of the New York project FG I dont really know Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me and I thought he was nuts I didnt think he knew what he was doing and he pulled it off So I think hes Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy He gets up there and then he  comes back up Theyre still talking about it September  generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero and Im totally against that I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time RSW The picture on the screen is that Disney FG Yeah RSW How much further along is it than that and when will that be finished FG That will be finished in   September October  and Im hoping Kyu and Herbie and YoYo and all those guys come play with us at that place Luckily today most of the people Im working with are people I really like Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me Hes been a cheerleader for quite a long time There arent many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients If you think about the world and even just in this audience most of us are involved with buildings Nothing that you would call architecture right And so to find one a guy like that you hang on to him Hes become the head of Art Center and theres a building by Craig Ellwood there I knew Craig and respected him They want to add to it and its hard to add to a building like that  its a beautiful minimalist black steel building  and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and its a lot of acreage I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal Alvaro Siza RSW Why did you want that FG I knew youd ask that question It was intuitive Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work and his early work had a resemblance to my early work When I came out of college I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that I tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasnt  I just stopped I mean Charlie Moore did a bunch of it but it didnt feel good to me Siza on the other hand continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didnt pan out I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you Ive done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra who doesnt think architecture is art Did you see that thing RSW No What did he say FG He calls architecture plumbing FG Anyway the Siza thing Its a richer experience It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians  its similar to that I would imagine  where you  huh Audience Liquid architecture FG Liquid architecture Where you  Its like jazz you improvise you work together you play off each other you make something they make something And I think for me its a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city RSW Is it going to be near the current campus Or is it going to be down near  FG No its near the current campus Anyway hes that kind of patron Its not his money of course RSW Whats his schedule on that FG I dont know Whats the schedule Richard Richard Koshalek Unclear starts from  FG  You can come to the opening Ill invite you No but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos right Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment and if you can figure out how to work off each other  if you can get a bunch of people who respect each others work and play off each other you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect Like the Rockefeller Center model which is kind of from another era RSW I found the most remarkable thing My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building you go inside and thered be extraordinary spaces Id seen drawings you had presented here at TED The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city That was the surprise of going across the river of going on the highway around it of walking down the street and finding it That was the real surprise of Bilbao FG But you know Richard most architects when they present their work  most of the people we know you get up and you talk about your work and its almost like you tell everybody youre a good guy by saying Look Im worried about the context Im worried about the city Im worried about my client I worry about budget that Im on time Blah blah blah and all that stuff And its like cleansing yourself so that you can  by saying all that it means your work is good somehow And I think everybody  I mean that should be a matter of fact like gravity Youre not going to defy gravity Youve got to work with the building department If you dont meet the budgets youre not going to get much work If it leaks  Bilbao did not leak I was so proud The MIT project  they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao I met them in Bilbao They came for three days RSW This is the computer building FG Yeah the computer building They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around  I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden you know People put buckets out  I was clean There wasnt a bloody leak in the place it was just fantastic But youve got to  yeah well up until then every building leaked so this  RSW Frank had a sort of  FG Ask Miriam RW  sort of had a fame His fame was built on that in LA for a while FG Youve all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story when the woman called and said Mr Wright Im sitting on the couch and the waters pouring in on my head And he said Madam move your chair So some years later I was doing a building a little house on the beach for Norton Simon and his secretary who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady called me and said Mr Simons sitting at his desk and the waters coming in on his head And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story RSW Didnt get a laugh FG No Not now either But my point is that  and I call it the then what OK you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice you loved your clients you loved the city youre a good guy youre a good person  and then what What do you bring to it And I think thats what Ive always been interested in is that  which is a personal kind of expression Bilbao I think shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city Thats what reminded me of it And I think thats the issue you know its the then what that most clients who hire architects  most clients arent hiring architects for that Theyre hiring them to get it done get it on budget be polite and theyre missing out on the real value of an architect RSW At a certain point a number of years ago people  when Michael Graves was a fashion before teapots  FG I did a teapot and nobody bought it RSW Did it leak FG No RSW  people wanted a Michael Graves building Is that a curse that people want a Bilbao building FG Yeah Since Bilbao opened which is now four five years both Krens and I have been called with at least  opportunities  China Brazil other parts of Spain  to come in and do the Bilbao effect And Ive met with some of these people Usually I say no right away but some of them come with pedigree and they sound wellintentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings In one case I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port I asked them what kind of building it was When you get here well explain it Blah blah blah So four of us went And they took us  they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor Each one was more beautiful than the other And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga Just before going to lunch with the mayor we went to the harbor commissioner It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here and I was here and my guys We sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet And the guy looked at me and said Now what can I do for you Mr Gehry RSW Oh my God FG So I got up I said to my team Lets get out of here We stood up we walked out They followed  the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said You mean youre not going to have lunch with the mayor I said Nope Youre not going to have dinner at all They just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project And we get a lot of that Luckily Im old enough that I can complain I cant travel I dont have my own plane yet RSW Well Im going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because its been very long But let me just say a couple words FG Can I say something Are you going to talk about me or you RSW Once a shit always a shit FG Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody so  RSW Youre going to get one Youre going to get one Im going to make it for you FG No no Wait a minute ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
14,Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories only to find out that youre a performance artist Im also a software engineer and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer And I think the main thing that Im interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft and in a way those are my bane I think theres a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about whats possible on the computer Of course its also a great liberating force that makes possible you know publishing and so forth and standards and so on But in a way the computer makes possible much more than what most people think and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer and so I end up writing software to do that Chris has asked me to do a short performance and so Im going to take just this time  maybe  minutes  to do that and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form Thank you Weve got about a minute left Id just like to show a clip from a most recent project I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica we repeated it in England And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were And since we know where their heads are and we have a wireless mic on them that were processing the sound from were able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what theyre doing with their speech This will take about  seconds or so Hes making a kind of cheekflapping sound Well suffice it to say its not all like that but thats part of it Thanks very much Theres always lots more Im overtime so I just wanted to say you can if youre in New York you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea And with that I think I should give up the stage so thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
16,"Id like to talk today
about the two biggest social trends in the coming century and perhaps in the next  years But I want to start
with my work on romantic love because thats my most recent work What I and my colleagues did was put
 people who were madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner  who were madly in love
and their love was accepted and  who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped And so I want to tell you
about that first and then go on into where
I think love is going What tis to love Shakespeare said I think our ancestors  I think human beings have been
wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was by looking at the last  years
of the psychological research and as it turns out theres a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love The first thing that happens is a person begins to take on
what I call special meaning As a truck driver once said to me The world had a new center
and that center was Mary Anne George Bernard Shaw said it differently Love consists of overestimating
the differences between one woman and another And indeed thats what we do And then you just focus on this person You can list what you
dont like about them but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do As Chaucer said Love is blind In trying to understand romantic love I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world and I just want to give
you one very short poem from eighthcentury China because its an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman Its a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot  their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party And in this case a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat And it goes like this Its by a guy called Yuan Zhen I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat The night I brought you home
I watched you roll it out He became hooked on a sleeping mat probably because of elevated activity
of dopamine in his brain just like with you and me But anyway not only does this person
take on special meaning you focus your attention on them You aggrandize them But you have intense energy As one Polynesian said
I felt like jumping in the sky Youre up all night
Youre walking till dawn You feel intense elation
when things are going well mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly Real dependence on this person As one businessman in New York said to me Anything she liked I liked Simple Romantic love is very simple You become extremely sexually possessive You know if youre just sleeping
with somebody casually you dont really care
if theyre sleeping with somebody else But the moment you fall in love you become extremely
sexually possessive of them I think theres a Darwinian
purpose to this The whole point of this
is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team But the main characteristics
of romantic love are craving an intense craving
to be with a particular person not just sexually but emotionally It would be nice to go to bed with them but you want them to call you
on the telephone to invite you out etc to tell you that they love you The other main characteristic
is motivation The motor in the brain begins to crank
and you want this person And last but not least
it is an obsession Before I put these people
in the MRI machine I would ask them all kinds of questions But my most important question
was always the same It was What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person And indeed they would say All day All night I can never stop thinking
about him or her And then the very last question  I would always have to work
myself up to this question because Im not a psychologist I dont work with people
in any kind of traumatic situation My final question was always the same I would say
Would you die for him or her And indeed these people would say Yes as if I had asked them to pass the salt I was just staggered by it So we scanned their brains looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph with a distraction task in between So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions In fact one of the most important
was a brain region that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine And indeed thats exactly what happens I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion In fact I had always thought
it was a series of emotions from very high to very low But actually its a drive It comes from the motor of the mind the wanting part of the mind
the craving part of the mind The kind of part of the mind when youre reaching
for that piece of chocolate when you want to win
that promotion at work The motor of the brain Its a drive And in fact I think its more powerful
than the sex drive You know if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you and they say No thank you you certainly dont kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression But certainly around the world people who are rejected
in love will kill for it People live for love They kill for love They die for love They have songs poems novels sculptures paintings myths legends In over  societies people have left their evidence
of this powerful brain system I have come to think its one of the most powerful
brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow And Ive also come to think that its one of three
basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction One is the sex drive
the craving for sexual gratification WH Auden called it
an intolerable neural itch and indeed thats what it is It keeps bothering you
a little bit like being hungry The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love that elation obsession of early love And the third brain system is attachment that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a longterm partner And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there looking for a whole range of partners You can feel it when youre just
driving along in your car It can be focused on nobody I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time thereby conserving mating time and energy And I think that attachment
the third brain system evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team So with that preamble I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends One of the last  years and the other
certainly of the last  years that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems lust romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner The first is women working
moving into the workforce Ive looked at  societies through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations Everywhere in the world
 out of  of them women are not only moving
into the job market  sometimes very very slowly
but they are moving into the job market  and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women in terms of economic power
health and education Its very slow For every trend on this planet
theres a countertrend We all know of them but nevertheless  the Arabs say The dogs may bark
but the caravan moves on And indeed that caravan is moving on Women are moving back into the job market And I say back into the job market
because this is not new For millions of years
on the grasslands of Africa women commuted to work
to gather their vegetables They came home with  to  percent
of the evening meal The double income family was the standard And women were regarded
as just as economically socially and sexually powerful as men In short were really
moving forward to the past Then womens worst
invention was the plow With the beginning of plow agriculture
mens roles became extremely powerful Women lost their ancient
jobs as collectors but then with the industrial revolution
and the postindustrial revolution theyre moving back into the job market In short they are acquiring the status
that they had a million years ago  years ago  years ago We are seeing now one
of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal And its going to have an impact I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women
on the business community Ill say just a couple of things
and then go on to sex and love Theres a lot of gender differences anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child I dont know why they want to think
that men and women are alike Theres much we have in common but theres a whole lot
that we do not have in common We are  in the words of Ted Hughes I think that we are like two feet
We need each other to get ahead But we did not evolve
to have the same brain And were finding more and more
gender differences in the brain Ill only just use a couple
and then move on to sex and love One of them is womens verbal ability Women can talk Womens ability to find the right word
rapidly basic articulation goes up in the middle
of the menstrual cycle when estrogen levels peak But even at menstruation
theyre better than the average man Women can talk Theyve been doing it for a million years
words were womens tools They held that baby
in front of their face cajoling it reprimanding it
educating it with words And indeed theyre becoming
a very powerful force Even in places like India and Japan where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market theyre moving into journalism And I think that the television
is like the global campfire We sit around it and it shapes our minds Almost always when Im on TV
the producer who calls me who negotiates what were going to say is a woman In fact Solzhenitsyn once said To have a great writer
is to have another government Today  percent of people
who are writers in America are women Its one of many many
characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market Theyve got incredible people skills
negotiating skills Theyre highly imaginative We now know the brain circuitry
of imagination of longterm planning They tend to be web thinkers Because the female parts
of the brain are better connected they tend to collect more
pieces of data when they think put them into more complex patterns
see more options and outcomes They tend to be contextual
holistic thinkers what I call web thinkers Men tend to  and these are averages  tend to get rid of what they regard
as extraneous focus on what they do and move in a more
stepbystep thinking pattern Theyre both perfectly good
ways of thinking We need both of them to get ahead In fact theres many more
male geniuses in the world And theres also many more
male idiots in the world When the male brain works well
it works extremely well And what I really think
that were doing is were moving towards
a collaborative society a society in which the talents
of both men and women are becoming understood
and valued and employed But in fact women moving
into the job market is having a huge impact
on sex and romance and family life Foremost women are starting
to express their sexuality Im always astonished
when people come to me and say Why is it that men are so adulterous Why do you think
more men are adulterous than women Well men are more adulterous And I say Who do you think
these men are sleeping with And  basic math Anyway In the Western world women start sooner at sex
have more partners express less remorse
for the partners that they do marry later have fewer children leave bad marriages
in order to get good ones We are seeing the rise
of female sexual expression And indeed once again were moving
forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands
of Africa a million years ago because this is the kind
of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today Were also returning
to an ancient form of marriage equality Theyre now saying that the st century is going to be the century of what
they call the symmetrical marriage or the pure marriage
or the companionate marriage This is a marriage between equals moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit Were also seeing a rise of romantic love  percent of American women
and  percent of American men would not marry somebody
who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner if they were not in love with that person People around the world
in a study of  societies want to be in love
with the person that they marry Indeed arranged marriages are
on their way off this braid of human life I even think that marriages
might even become more stable because of the second great world trend The first one being women
moving into the job market the second one being
the aging world population Theyre now saying that in America that middle age should be regarded
as up to age  Because in that highest
age category of  to  as much as  percent of people
have nothing really wrong with them So were seeing theres a real
extension of middle age For one of my books
I looked at divorce data in  societies And as it turns out the older you get
the less likely you are to divorce So the divorce rate right now
is stable in America and its actually beginning to decline It may decline some more I would even say that with Viagra estrogen replacement hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women  women have never been
as interesting as they are now Not at any time on this planet
have women been so educated so interesting so capable And so I honestly think that if there
really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make
good marriages that time is now However theres always kinds
of complications in this These three brain systems 
lust romantic love and attachment  dont always go together They can go together by the way Thats why casual sex isnt so casual With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine Dopamines associated with romantic love and you can just
fall in love with somebody who youre just having casual sex with With orgasm then you get a real rush
of oxytocin and vasopressin  those are associated with attachment This is why you can feel such a sense
of cosmic union with somebody after youve made love to them But these three brain systems
lust romantic love and attachment arent always connected to each other You can feel deep attachment
to a longterm partner while you feel intense
romantic love for somebody else while you feel the sex drive for people
unrelated to these other partners In short were capable of loving
more than one person at a time In fact you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings
of attachment for one person to deep feelings
of romantic love for somebody else Its as if theres a committee meeting
going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do So I dont think honestly were an animal
that was built to be happy we are an animal
that was built to reproduce I think the happiness we find we make And I think however we can make good relationships
with each other So I want to conclude with two things I want to conclude with a worry and with a wonderful story The worry is about antidepressants Over  million prescriptions
of antidepressants are written every year
in the United States And these drugs are going generic They are seeping around the world I know one girl whos been
on these antidepressants SSRIs serotoninenhancing
antidepressants  since she was  Shes  Shes been on them
ever since she was  Ive got nothing against people
who take them short term when theyre going
through something horrible They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else I would recommend it But more and more people
in the United States are taking them long term And indeed what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin And by raising levels of serotonin
you suppress the dopamine circuit Everybody knows that Dopamine is associated with romantic love Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit but they kill the sex drive And when you kill the sex drive
you kill orgasm And when you kill orgasm you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment The things are connected in the brain And when you tamper with one brain system youre going to tamper with another Im just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place So now  Thank you I want to end with a story And then just a comment Ive been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for  years Im an identical twin
I am interested in why were all alike Why you and I are alike
why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River are all alike And about a year ago an Internet dating service
Matchcom came to me and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them I said I dont know anything
about personality You know I dont know Do you think
youve got the right person They said Yes It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another Thats my current project
it will be my next book Theres all kinds of reasons that you fall in love
with one person rather than another Timing is important
Proximity is important Mystery is important You fall in love with somebody
whos somewhat mysterious in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love You fall in love with somebody who fits within
what I call your love map an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood
as you grow up And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people actually with somewhat
complementary brain systems And thats what Im now
contributing to this But I want to tell you
a story to illustrate Ive been carrying on here
about the biology of love I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it too the magic of it Its a story that was told to me by somebody who had
heard it just from one  probably a true story It was a graduate student 
Im at Rutgers and my two colleagues  Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook Thats where we put our people
in the MRI machine And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student and she was not in love with him And they were
all at a conference in Beijing And he knew from our work that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain and perhaps trigger
this brain system for romantic love So he decided hed put science to work And he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him And sure enough  Ive never been in one but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks and its crazy and its noisy
and its exciting He figured that this
would drive up the dopamine and shed fall in love with him So off they go and shes squealing
and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw and she throws her hands up and she says Wasnt that wonderful And Wasnt that rickshaw
driver handsome Theres magic to love But I will end by saying
that millions of years ago we evolved three basic drives the sex drive romantic love and attachment to a longterm partner These circuits are deeply
embedded in the human brain Theyre going to survive
as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called
this mortal coil Thank you Chris Anderson Helen Fisher ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
18,It is a thrill to be here at a conference thats devoted to Inspired by Nature  you can imagine And Im also thrilled to be in the foreplay section Did you notice this section is foreplay Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters which is the Western Grebe You havent lived until youve seen these guys do their courtship dance I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and my partner and I have a rowing shell And so we were rowing and one of these Western Grebes came along And what they do for their courtship dance is they go together the two of them the two mates and they begin to run underwater They paddle faster and faster and faster until theyre going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water and theyre standing upright sort of paddling the top of the water And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing And so were in a skull and were moving really really quickly And this Grebe I think sort of mistaked us for a prospect and started to run along the water next to us in a courtship dance  for miles It would stop and then start and then stop and then start Now that is foreplay I came this close to changing species at that moment Obviously life can teach us something in the entertainment section Life has a lot to teach us But what Id like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design Whats happened since the book came out  the book was mainly about research in biomimicry  and whats happened since then is architects designers engineers  people who make our world  have started to call and say we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us in real time become inspired Or  and this is the fun part for me  we want you to take us out into the natural world Well come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world who might inspire us So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers they purify wastewater And some of them were very resistant actually to being there What they said to us at first was you know we already do biomimicry We use bacteria to clean our water And we said well thats not exactly being inspired by nature Thats bioprocessing you know thats bioassisted technology using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old old technology called domestication This is learning something learning an idea from an organism and then applying it And so they still werent getting it So we went for a walk on the beach and I said well give me one of your big problems Give me a design challenge sustainability speed bump thats keeping you from being sustainable And they said scaling which is the buildup of minerals inside of pipes And they said you know what happens is mineral  just like at your house  mineral builds up And then the aperture closes and we have to flush the pipes with toxins or we have to dig them up So if we had some way to stop this scaling  and so I picked up some shells on the beach And I asked them what is scaling Whats inside your pipes And they said calcium carbonate And I said thats what this is this is calcium carbonate And they didnt know that They didnt know that what a seashell is its templated by proteins and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell So the same sort of a process without the proteins is happening on the inside of their pipes They didnt know This is not for lack of information its a lack of integration You know its a silo people in silos They didnt know that the same thing was happening So one of them thought about it and said OK well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater  selfassembly  then why arent shells infinite in size What stops the scaling Why dont they just keep on going And I said well in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization  and then they all sort of leaned in  they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal And in fact there is a product called TPA thats mimicked that protein  that stopprotein  and its an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes That changed everything From then on you could not get these engineers back in the boat The first day they would take a hike and it was click click click click Five minutes later they were back in the boat Were done You know Ive seen that island After this they were crawling all over They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve Learning about the natural world is one thing learning from the natural world  thats the switch Thats the profound switch What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world  billion years of fieldtesting  to   Craig Venter will probably tell you I think theres a lot more than  million  welladapted solutions The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context And the context is the Earth  the same context that were trying to solve our problems in So its the conscious emulation of lifes genius Its not slavishly mimicking  although Al is trying to get the hairdo going  its not a slavish mimicry its taking the design principles the genius of the natural world and learning something from it Now in a group with so many IT people I do have to mention what Im not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side So theres computers that protect themselves like an immune system and were learning from gene regulation and biological development And were learning from neural nets genetic algorithms evolutionary computing Thats on the software side But whats interesting to me is that we havent looked at this as much I mean these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that theres dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success So what can we learn about making  not just computers but everything The plane you came in cars the seats that youre sitting on How do we redesign the world that we make the humanmade world More importantly what should we ask in the next  years And theres a lot of cool technologies out there that life has Whats the syllabus Three questions for me are key How does life make things This is the opposite this is how we make things Its called heat beat and treat  thats what material scientists call it And its carving things down from the top with  percent waste left over and only  percent product You heat it up you beat it with high pressures you use chemicals OK Heat beat and treat Life cant afford to do that How does life make things How does life make the most of things Thats a geranium pollen And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily Look at that shape Life adds information to matter In other words structure It gives it information By adding information to matter it gives it a function thats different than without that structure And thirdly how does life make things disappear into systems Because life doesnt really deal in things there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems Really quick syllabus As Im reading more and more now and following the story there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences And at the same time Im listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are The two groups are not talking to each other At all What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that were in Im going to try to go through  really quickly One thats exciting to me is selfassembly Now youve heard about this in terms of nanotechnology Back to that shell the shell is a selfassembling material On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater Its a layered structure thats mineral and then polymer and it makes it very very tough Its twice as tough as our hightech ceramics But whats really interesting unlike our ceramics that are in kilns it happens in seawater It happens near in and near the organisms body This is Sandia National Labs A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a selfassembling coding process Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid lifting it out of the liquid and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works Imagine making all of our hard materials that way Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell to a solar cell onto a roof and having it selfassemble into a layered structure that harvests light Heres an interesting one for the IT world biosilicon This is a diatom which is made of silicates And so silicon which we make right now  its part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips  this is a biomineralization process thats now being mimicked This is at UC Santa Barbara Look at these diatoms This is from Ernst Haeckels work Imagine being able to  and again its a templated process and it solidifies out of a liquid process  imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature Imagine being able to make perfect lenses On the left this is a brittle star its covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever Its one of the most distortionfree lenses we know of And theres many of them all over its entire body Whats interesting again is that it selfassembles A woman named Joanna Aizenberg at Lucent is now learning to do this in a lowtemperature process to create these sort of lenses Shes also looking at fiber optics Thats a sea sponge that has a fiber optic Down at the very base of it theres fiber optics that work better than ours actually to move light but you can tie them in a knot theyre incredibly flexible Heres another big idea CO as a feedstock A guy named Geoff Coates at Cornell said to himself you know plants do not see CO as the biggest poison of our time We see it that way Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose right out of CO Hes found a way  hes found a catalyst  and hes found a way to take CO and make it into polycarbonates Biodegradable plastics out of CO  how plantlike Solar transformations the most exciting one There are people who are mimicking the energyharvesting device inside of purple bacterium the people at ASU Even more interesting lately in the last couple of weeks people have seen that theres an enzyme called hydrogenase thats able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons and is able to take hydrogen up  basically whats happening in a fuel cell in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell In our fuel cells we do it with platinum life does it with a very very common iron And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogenjuggling hydrogenase Thats very exciting for fuel cells  to be able to do that without platinum Power of shape heres a whale Weve seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in for instance the edge of an airplane  increase efficiency by about  percent Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing Color without pigments this peacock is creating color with shape Light comes through it bounces back off the layers its called thinfilm interference Imagine being able to selfassemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface so that its selfcleaning with just water Thats what a leaf does See that upclose picture Thats a ball of water and those are dirt particles And thats an upclose picture of a lotus leaf Theres a company making a product called Lotusan which mimics  when the building facade paint dries it mimics the bumps in a selfcleaning leaf and rainwater cleans the building Water is going to be our big grand challenge quenching thirst Here are two organisms that pull water The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog The one on the right is a pill bug  pulls water out of air does not drink fresh water Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta before it gets into a building are key technologies Separation technologies are going to be extremely important What if we were to say no more hard rock mining What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams small amounts of metals in water Thats what microbes do they chelate metals out of water Theres a company here in San Francisco called MR that is embedding mimics of the microbes molecules on filters to mine waste streams Green chemistry is chemistry in water We do chemistry in organic solvents This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider Isnt that beautiful Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with natures recipe book Its not easy because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table And we use all of them even the toxic ones To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table and create miracle materials like that cell is the task of green chemistry Timed degradation packaging that is good until you dont want it to be good anymore and dissolves on cue Thats a mussel you can find in the waters out here and the threads holding it to a rock are timed at exactly two years they begin to dissolve Healing this is a good one That little guy over there is a tardigrade There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken whats called the cold chain gets broken A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade  which dries out completely and yet stays alive for months and months and months and is able to regenerate itself And he found a way to dry out vaccines  encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells  meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated They can be put in a glove compartment OK Learning from organisms This is a session about water  learning about organisms that can do without water in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration Im not going to get to  But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing besides all of these adaptations is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place thats going to take care of their offspring When theyre involved in foreplay theyre thinking about something very very important  and thats having their genetic material remain  generations from now And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place thatll take care of their offspring Thats the biggest design challenge Luckily there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas Good luck having a conversation with them Thank you Chris Anderson Talk about foreplay I  we need to get to  but really quickly Janine Benyus Oh really CA Yeah Just like you know like the second version of   and  Because we just  your slides are so gorgeous and the ideas are so big I cant stand to let you go down without seeing   and  JB OK put this  OK Ill just hold this thing OK great OK so thats the healing one Sensing and responding feedback is a huge thing This is a locust There can be  million of them in a square kilometer and yet they dont collide with one another And yet we have  million car collisions a year Right Theres a person at Newcastle who has figured out that its a very large neuron And shes actually figuring out how to make a collisionavoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust This is a huge and important one number  And thats the growing fertility That means you know net fertility farming We should be growing fertility And oh yes  we get food too Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life And really thats what other organisms do as well In ensemble thats what whole ecosystems do they create more and more opportunities for life Our farming has done the opposite So farming based on how a prairie builds soil ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water but creates incredibly sparkling productivity This is the simple design brief I mean it looks simple because the system over  billion years has worked this out That is those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places are not around to tell us about it Thats the twelfth one Life  and this is the secret trick this is the magic trick  life creates conditions conducive to life It builds soil it cleans air it cleans water it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs So its not mutually exclusive We have to find a way to meet our needs while making of this place an Eden CA Janine thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
19,I dont know about you but I havent quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life Ive spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about Should I be protechnology Should I embrace it full arms Should I be wary Like you Im very tempted by the latest thing But at the other hand a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions sold all my technology  except for a bicycle  and rode across  miles on the US back roads under the power of my one body fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food And Ive since then tried to keep technology at arms length in many ways so it doesnt master my life At the same time I run a website on cool tools where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology So Im still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity as it relates to nature as it relates to the spiritual And Im not even sure we know what technology is And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in  Before that obviously technology didnt exist But obviously it did I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born So it sums up a lot of what were talking about Danny Hillis actually has an update on that  he says technology is anything that doesnt quite work yet Which also I think gets into a little bit of our current idea But I was interested in another definition of technology Something again that went back to something more fundamental Something that was deeper And as I struggled to understand that I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations And Im this morning going to talk about this for the first time So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud The question that I came up with was this question what does technology want And by that I dont mean does it want chocolate or vanilla By what it wants I mean what are its inherent trends and biases What are its tendencies over time One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms which weve heard a lot about And the trick that Richard Dawkins does which is to say to look at them as simply as genes as vehicles for genes So hes saying what do genes want The selfish gene And Im applying a similar trick to say what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology What does technology want Obviously this in an incomplete question just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it But its still very very productive So Im attempting to say if we take technologys view of the world what does it want And I think once we ask that question we have to go back actually to life Because obviously if we keep extending the origins of technology far back I think we come back to life at some point So thats where I want to begin my little exploration is in life And like you heard from the previous speakers we dont really know what life there is on Earth right now We have really no idea Craig Venters tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great Brian Farrells work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects just to see whats on life And if we did that with our little Martian probe which we have not done on Earth we would begin to see some incredible species This is not on another planet These are things that are hidden away on our planet This is an ant that stores its colleagues honey in its abdomen Each one of these organisms that weve described  that youve seen from Jamie and others these magnificent things  what theyre doing each one of them is theyre hacking the rules of life I cant think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism Every single thing that we can think of  and if you heard Olivias talk about the sexual habits youll realize that there isnt anything we can say thats true for all life because every single one of them is hacking something about it This is a solarpowered sea slug Its a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy This is another version of that This is a sea dragon and the one on the bottom the blue one is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid has not yet taken in the browngreen algae pond scum into its body to give it energy These are hacks and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are current consensus six kingdoms Six different broad approaches the plants the animals the fungi the protests  the little things  the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria The Archaeas Those are the general approaches to life Thats one way to look at life on Earth today But a more interesting way the current way to take the long view is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time we have it coming out from the center So in the center is the most primitive and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth This is all the same six kingdoms You see  representative species and you can see where we are But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans Theyve been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here But we see that each one of these is actually hacking and has a different way of finding out how to do life And if we take the longterm trends of life if we begin to say what does evolution want Theres several things that we see One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we dont find life We find life at the bottom of every longterm longdistance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up  and theres bacteria in the pores of that rock And wherever life is it never retreats Its ubiquitous and it wants to be more More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life The second thing is is we see diversity We also see specialization We see the movement from a generalpurpose cell to the more specific and specialized And we see a drift towards complexity thats very intuitive And actually we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time And the last thing I bring back this nudibranch One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life Like those chloroplast cells  theyre completely surrounded by other life They never touch the inner matter There is more and more coevolution And so the general longterm trends of evolution are roughly these five ubiquity diversity specialization complexity and socialization Now I took that and said OK what are the longterm trends in technology And again my question is what does technology want And so remarkably I discovered that theres also a drift toward specialization That we see theres a general hammer and hammers become more and more specific over time Theres obviously diversity Huge numbers of things This is all the contents of a Japanese home I actually had my daughter  gave her a tally counter and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household And it came up with  different species of products I did some research and found out that the King of England Henry VIII had only about  items in his household And he was the King of England and that was the entire wealth of England at the time So were seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things This is a scene from Star Wars where the PO comes out and he sees machines making machines How depraved Well this is actually what were headed towards world machines And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not nontechnology or even life And thirdly the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche And Im happy to say I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological but thats pretty evident So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution The same drives that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization towards complexity That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out say the evolution of armor you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionarytype cladistic tree I suggest that in fact technology is the seventh kingdom of life That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom And so it would be sort of approximately up there coming out of the animal kingdom And if we were to do that we would find out  we could actually approach technology in this way This is Niles Eldredge He was the codeveloper with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium But as a sideline he happens to collect cornets He has one of the worlds largest collections  about  of them And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites or snails and to do a morphological analysis and try to derive their genealogical history over time This is his chart which is not quite published yet But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made That does not happen in biology When something is extinct you cant have it as your parent But that does happen in technology And it turns out that thats so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system In fact this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology And it turns out that in fact technologies dont die So I suggested this to an historian of science and he said Well what about you know come on what about steam cars Theyre not around anymore Well actually they are In fact theyre so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile And this is a website of a guy whos selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile And the thing that I liked is sort of this oneclick addtoyourcart button  Laughter  for buying steam valves I mean it was just  it was really there And so I began to think about well maybe thats just a random sample Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way So I took the great big  Montgomery Wards catalog and I randomly went through it And I took a page  not quite a random page  I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made But I took this page and I said how many of these things are still being made And not antiques I want to know how many of these things are still in production And the answer is all of them All of them are still being produced So youve got corn shellers I dont know who needs a corn sheller Be it corn shellers  youve got ploughs youve got fan mills all these things  and these are not again antiques These are  you can order these You can go to the web and you can buy them now brandnew made So in a certain sense technologies dont die In fact you can buy for  bucks a stoneage knife made exactly the same way that they were made  years ago Its short bone handle  bucks And in fact whats important is that this information actually never died out Its not just that it was resurrected Its continued all along And in Papua New Guinea they were making stone axes until two decades ago just as a course of practical matters Even when we try to get rid of a technology its actually very hard So weve all heard about the Amish giving up cars Weve heard about the Japanese giving up guns Weve heard about this and that But I actually went back and took what I could find the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology and then I tried to find out when they came back in because they always came back in And it turns out that the time the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited is decreasing over time And that basically you can delay technology but you cant kill it So this makes sense because in a certain sense what culture is is the accumulation of ideas Thats what its for Its so that ideas dont die out And when we take that we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the longterm trajectory  again in lifes evolution  we find that each case  each of the major transitions in life  what theyre really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens Theyre actually changing the way in which ideas are generated So all these steps in evolution are increasing basically the evolution of evolvability So whats happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas these new hacks are increasing And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring And then what we see in the singularity that prophesized by Kurzweil and others  his idea that technology is accelerating evolution Its accelerating the way in which we search for ideas So if you have life hacking  life means hacking the game of survival  then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve That is what we call an infinite game Thats the definition of infinite game A finite game is play to win and an infinite game is played to keep playing And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force The origins of technology was not in  but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot and it was so tight in there there was no room for any difference at all Thats the definition There was no temperature There was no difference whatsoever And at the Big Bang what it expanded was the potential for difference So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences diversity options choices opportunities possibilities and freedoms Those are all basically the same thing And those are the things that technology brings us Thats what technology is bringing us choices possibilities freedoms Thats what its about Its this expansion of room to make differences And so a hammer when we grab a hammer thats what were grabbing And thats why we continue to grab technology  because we want those things Those things are good Differences freedom choices possibilities And each time we make a new opportunity place were allowing a platform to make new ones And I think its really important Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented  what a loss to society there would be Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film Somewhere today there are millions of young children being born whose technology of selfexpression has not yet been invented We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals Thats what technology really wants Im going to skip through some of the objections because I dont have answers to why theres deforestation I dont have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies I dont have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom because its so close to what life is about maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life Maybe in some ways the fact that what were trying to do with technology is find a good home for it Its a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields but its a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village Our humanity is actually defined by technology All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology This is the infinite game Thats what were talking about You see technology is a way to evolve the evolution Its a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more And its actually a way of playing the game of playing all the games Thats what technology wants And so when I think about what technology wants I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here  and I really believe this  every person here has an assignment And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is That recursive nature is the infinite game And if you play that well youll have other people involved so even that game extends and continues even when youre gone That is the infinite game And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are Thank you ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
20,"I think I was supposed
to talk about my new book which is called Blink and its about snap judgments
and first impressions And it comes out in January
and I hope you all buy it in triplicate But I was thinking about this and I realized that although
my new book makes me happy and I think would make my mother happy its not really about happiness So I decided instead
I would talk about someone who I think has done as much
to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last  years a man who is a great
personal hero of mine someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz who is most famous
for reinventing spaghetti sauce Howards about this high and hes round and hes in his s
and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair and he has a kind of wonderful
exuberance and vitality and he has a parrot
and he loves the opera and hes a great aficionado
of medieval history And by profession hes a psychophysicist Now I should tell you that I have no idea
what psychophysics is although at some point in my life I dated a girl for two years who was getting
her doctorate in psychophysics Which should tell you something
about that relationship As far as I know psychophysics
is about measuring things And Howard is very interested
in measuring things And he graduated
with his doctorate from Harvard and he set up a little consulting shop
in White Plains New York And one of his first clients was Pepsi This is many years ago
back in the early s And Pepsi came to Howard and they said You know theres this new
thing called aspartame and we would like to make Diet Pepsi Wed like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put
in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink Now that sounds like an incredibly
straightforward question to answer and thats what Howard thought Because Pepsi told him Were working with a band
between eight and  percent Anything below eight percent
sweetness is not sweet enough anything above  percent
sweetness is too sweet We want to know whats the sweet
spot between  and  Now if I gave you this problem to do
you would all say its very simple What we do is you make up
a big experimental batch of Pepsi at every degree of sweetness 
eight percent    all the way up to   and we try this out
with thousands of people and we plot the results on a curve and we take the most popular
concentration right Really simple Howard does the experiment
and he gets the data back and he plots it on a curve and all of a sudden he realizes
its not a nice bell curve In fact the data doesnt make any sense Its a mess Its all over the place Now most people in that business
in the world of testing food and such are not dismayed
when the data comes back a mess They think Well you know figuring out what people think
about colas not that easy You know maybe we made an error
somewhere along the way You know lets just
make an educated guess and they simply point
and they go for  percent right in the middle Howard is not so easily placated Howard is a man of a certain degree
of intellectual standards And this was not good enough for him and this question bedeviled him for years And he would think it through
and say What was wrong Why could we not make sense
of this experiment with Diet Pepsi And one day he was sitting
in a diner in White Plains about to go trying to dream up
some work for Nescaf And suddenly like a bolt of lightning
the answer came to him And that is that when they analyzed
the Diet Pepsi data they were asking the wrong question They were looking for the perfect Pepsi and they should have been
looking for the perfect Pepsis Trust me This was an enormous revelation This was one of the most brilliant
breakthroughs in all of food science Howard immediately went on the road and he would go to conferences
around the country and he would stand up and say You had been looking
for the perfect Pepsi Youre wrong You should be looking
for the perfect Pepsis And people would look at him
blankly and say What are you talking about Craziness And they would say Move Next Tried to get business
nobody would hire him  he was obsessed though and he talked about it
and talked about it Howard loves the Yiddish expression To a worm in horseradish
the world is horseradish This was his horseradish He was obsessed with it And finally he had a breakthrough Vlasic Pickles came to him and they said Doctor Moskowitz
we want to make the perfect pickle And he said There is no perfect pickle
there are only perfect pickles And he came back to them and he said You dont just need
to improve your regular you need to create zesty And thats where we got zesty pickles Then the next person came to him
Campbells Soup And this was even more important In fact Campbells Soup
is where Howard made his reputation Campbells made Prego and Prego in the early s
was struggling next to Rag which was the dominant
spaghetti sauce of the s and s In the industry  I dont
know whether you care about this or how much time I have to go into this But it was technically speaking
 this is an aside  Prego is a better tomato sauce than Rag The quality of the tomato paste
is much better the spice mix is far superior it adheres to the pasta
in a much more pleasing way In fact they would do
the famous bowl test back in the s with Rag and Prego Youd have a plate of spaghetti
and you would pour it on right And the Rag would all go to the bottom
and the Prego would sit on top Thats called adherence And anyway despite the fact
that they were far superior in adherence and the quality of their tomato paste Prego was struggling So they came to Howard
and they said fix us And Howard looked
at their product line and he said what you have is a dead tomato society So he said this is what I want to do And he got together
with the Campbells soup kitchen and he made  varieties
of spaghetti sauce And he varied them according
to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce by sweetness by level of garlic by tomatoeyness
by tartness by sourness by visible solids  my favorite term
in the spaghetti sauce business Every conceivable way
you can vary spaghetti sauce he varied spaghetti sauce And then he took this whole raft
of  spaghetti sauces and he went on the road He went to New York to Chicago he went to Jacksonville to Los Angeles And he brought in people
by the truckload into big halls And he sat them down for two hours and over the course of that two hours
he gave them ten bowls Ten small bowls of pasta with a different spaghetti
sauce on each one And after they ate each bowl
they had to rate from  to  how good they thought
the spaghetti sauce was At the end of that process
after doing it for months and months he had a mountain of data about how the American people
feel about spaghetti sauce And then he analyzed the data Did he look for the most popular
variety of spaghetti sauce No Howard doesnt believe
that there is such a thing Instead he looked
at the data and he said lets see if we can group all these
different data points into clusters Lets see if they congregate
around certain ideas And sure enough if you sit down and you analyze all this data
on spaghetti sauce you realize that all Americans
fall into one of three groups There are people
who like their spaghetti sauce plain there are people
who like their spaghetti sauce spicy and there are people
who like it extra chunky And of those three facts
the third one was the most significant because at the time in the early s if you went to a supermarket you would not find
extrachunky spaghetti sauce And Prego turned to Howard and they said Youre telling me
that one third of Americans crave extrachunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs And he said Yes And Prego then went back and completely reformulated
their spaghetti sauce and came out with a line of extra chunky
that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce
business in this country And over the next  years
they made  million dollars off their line of extrachunky sauces Everyone else in the industry looked
at what Howard had done and they said Oh my god Weve been
thinking all wrong And thats when you started to get
seven different kinds of vinegar and  different kinds of mustard
and  different kinds of olive oil And then eventually
even Rag hired Howard and Howard did the exact same thing
for Rag that he did for Prego And today if you go
to a really good supermarket do you know how many Rags there are  In six varieties Cheese Light Robusto Rich amp Hearty Old World Traditional  ExtraChunky Garden Thats Howards doing That is Howards gift
to the American people Now why is that important It is in fact enormously important Ill explain to you why What Howard did is he fundamentally
changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy Assumption number one
in the food industry used to be that the way to find out
what people want to eat what will make people happy
is to ask them And for years and years and years Rag and Prego would have focus groups and they would sit you down
and they would say What do you want in a spaghetti sauce Tell us what you want
in a spaghetti sauce And for all those years    years  through all those focus group sessions no one ever said they wanted extrachunky Even though at least a third of them
deep in their hearts actually did People dont know what they want As Howard loves to say The mind knows not
what the tongue wants Its a mystery And a critically important step in understanding
our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always
explain what we want deep down If I asked all of you for example
in this room what you want in a coffee you know what youd say Every one of you would say
I want a dark rich hearty roast Its what people always say
when you ask them What do you like
Dark rich hearty roast What percentage of you actually
like a dark rich hearty roast According to Howard somewhere
between  and  percent of you Most of you like milky weak coffee But you will never ever say
to someone who asks you what you want that I want a milky weak coffee So thats number one thing
that Howard did Number two thing that Howard did
is he made us realize  its another very critical point  he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call
horizontal segmentation Why is this critical Because this is the way the food industry
thought before Howard What were they obsessed with
in the early s They were obsessed with mustard In particular they were obsessed
with the story of Grey Poupon Used to be there were two mustards
Frenchs and Guldens What were they Yellow mustard Whats in it Yellow mustard seeds
turmeric and paprika That was mustard Grey Poupon came along with a Dijon Right Much more volatile brown mustard seed
some white wine a nose hit much more delicate aromatics And what do they do They put it in a little tiny glass jar
with a wonderful enameled label on it made it look French even though its made
in Oxnard California And instead of charging a dollar fifty
for the eightounce bottle the way that Frenchs and Guldens did they decided to charge four dollars And they had those ads With the guy in the Rolls Royce
eating the Grey Poupon Another pulls up and says
Do you have any Grey Poupon And the whole thing after they did that
Grey Poupon takes off Takes over the mustard business And everyones takehome lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something
that is more expensive something to aspire to Its to make them turn their back
on what they think they like now and reach out for something
higher up the mustard hierarchy A better mustard
A more expensive mustard A mustard of more sophistication
and culture and meaning And Howard looked to that
and said Thats wrong Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy Mustard exists just like tomato sauce
on a horizontal plane There is no good mustard or bad mustard There is no perfect mustard
or imperfect mustard There are only different kinds of mustards
that suit different kinds of people He fundamentally democratized
the way we think about taste And for that as well we owe
Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks Third thing that Howard did
and perhaps the most important is Howard confronted the notion
of the Platonic dish What do I mean by that For the longest time in the food industry there was a sense that there was one way a perfect way to make a dish You go to Chez Panisse they give you the redtail sashimi
with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction They dont give you five options
on the reduction They dont say Do you want
the extrachunky reduction or  No You just get the reduction Why Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion
about redtail sashimi This is the way it ought to be And she serves it that way
time and time again and if you quarrel with her she will say You know what Youre wrong This is the best way it ought to be
in this restaurant Now that same idea fueled
the commercial food industry as well They had a Platonic notion
of what tomato sauce was And where did that come from
It came from Italy Italian tomato sauce is what Its blended its thin The culture of tomato sauce was thin When we talked about authentic
tomato sauce in the s we talked about Italian tomato sauce we talked about the earliest Rags which had no visible solids right Which were thin you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom
of the pasta Thats what it was And why were we attached to that Because we thought
that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most
culturally authentic tomato sauce A And B we thought that if we gave them
the culturally authentic tomato sauce then they would embrace it And thats what would please
the maximum number of people In other words people in the cooking world
were looking for cooking universals They were looking for one way
to treat all of us And its good reason for them
to be obsessed with the idea of universals because all of science through the th century
and much of the th was obsessed with universals Psychologists medical scientists
economists were all interested
in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave But that changed right What is the great revolution
in science of the last   years It is the movement
from the search for universals to the understanding of variability Now in medical science
we dont want to know necessarily just how cancer works we want to know how your cancer
is different from my cancer I guess my cancer different
from your cancer Genetics has opened the door
to the study of human variability What Howard Moskowitz
was doing was saying This same revolution needs to happen
in the world of tomato sauce And for that we owe him
a great vote of thanks Ill give you one last
illustration of variability and that is  oh Im sorry Howard not only believed that
but he took it a second step which was to say that when we pursue
universal principles in food we arent just making an error we are actually doing ourselves
a massive disservice And the example he used was coffee And coffee is something he did
a lot of work with with Nescaf If I were to ask all of you to try
and come up with a brand of coffee  a type of coffee a brew 
that made all of you happy and then I asked you to rate that coffee the average score in this room for coffee
would be about  on a scale of  to  If however you allowed me
to break you into coffee clusters maybe three or four coffee clusters and I could make coffee just
for each of those individual clusters your scores would go from  to  or  The difference between coffee
at  and coffee at  is a difference between coffee
that makes you wince and coffee that makes you
deliriously happy That is the final and I think
most beautiful lesson of Howard Moskowitz that in embracing the diversity
of human beings we will find a surer way
to true happiness Thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21,"Over the past couple of days as Ive been preparing for my speech Ive become more and more nervous
about what Im going to say and about being on the same stage
as all these fascinating people Being on the same stage as Al Gore
who was the first person I ever voted for And  So I was getting pretty nervous and you know I didnt know
that Chris sits on the stage and thats more nerveracking But then I started thinking
about my family I started thinking about my father
and my grandfather and my greatgrandfather and I realized that I had all of these Teds
going through my bloodstream  that I had to consider this my element So who am I Chris kind of mentioned I started
a company with my husband We have about  people internationally If you looked in the book you saw this  which I really was appalled by And because I wanted
to impress you all with slides since I saw the great presentations
yesterday with graphs I made a graph that moves and I talk about the makeup of me So besides this freakish thing this is my science slide This is math and this is science
this is genetics This is my grandmother
and this is where I get this mouth So  Im a blogger which probably
to a lot of you means different things You may have heard
about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite
lock using a ballpoint pen and it spread all over Kryptonite had to adjust the lock and they had to address it
to avoid too many customer concerns You may have heard about Rathergate which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the th in  is not typeset on an old typewriter its on Word Bloggers exposed this or they worked hard to expose this You know blogs are scary
This is what you see I see this and Im sure scared 
I swear on stage  shitless about blogs because this is not
something thats friendly But there are blogs that are changing
the way we read news and consume media
and these are great examples These people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and thats incredibly important During the hurricane you had MSNBC posting
about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently This was possible because of the easy
nature of blogging tools You have my friend who has a blog on PVRs
personal recorders He makes enough money just by running ads to support his family up in Oregon Thats all he does now and this is something
that blogs have made possible And then you have something
like this which is Interplast Its a wonderful organization of people and doctors
who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery
to those who need it Children with cleft palates get it
and they document their story This is wonderful I am not that caring I talk about myself Thats what I am Im a blogger I have always decided that I was going
to be an expert on one thing and I am an expert on this person and so I write about it So the short story about my blog it started in  I was  I wasnt happy with my job because I was a designer but I wasnt being really stimulated I was an English major in college I didnt have any use for it
but I missed writing So I started to write a blog and I started to create things
like these little stories This was an illustration about my camp
experience when I was  years old and how I went to a YMCA camp
Christian camp and basically by the end I had made my friends hate me so much
that I hid in a bunk They couldnt find me
they sent a search party and I overheard people saying
they wish I had killed myself  jumped off Bible Peak You can laugh this is OK This is me This is what happened to me And when I started my blog
it was really this one goal  I said I am not going
to be famous to the world but I could be famous
to people on the Internet And I set a goal I said Im going to win an award because I had never won
an award in my entire life And I said Im going to win
the South by Southwest Weblog award And I won it  I reached
all of these people and I had tens of thousands of people
reading about my life every day And then I wrote a post about a banjo I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo  a  banjo which is a lot of money And I dont play instruments I dont know anything about music I like music and I like banjos and I think I probably heard
Steve Martin playing and I said I could do that And I said to my husband Ben can I buy a banjo
And hes like No And my husband  this is my husband who is very hot  he won an award for being hot He told me You cannot buy a banjo Youre just like your dad
who collects instruments And I wrote a post
about how I was so mad at him he was such a tyrant 
he would not let me buy this banjo And those people who know me
understood my joke  this is Mena this is how
I make a joke at people Because the joke in this
is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog And if he knew I was showing
this right now  I put this in today  he would kill me But the thing was my friends read it and theyre like Oh that Mena
she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing
and being stupid But I got emails from people that said Oh my God your husband
is such an asshole How much money does
he spend on beer in a year You could take that money
and buy your banjo Why dont you open a separate account Ive been with him since I was 
weve never had a separate bank account They said Separate your bank account Spend your money
spend his money thats it And then I got people saying Leave him I was like OK what
Who are these people And why are they reading this And I realized I dont
want to reach these people I dont want to write
for this public audience And I started to kill my blog slowly Im like I dont want
to write this anymore Slowly and slowly  And I did tell personal
stories from time to time I wrote this one and I put this
up because of Einstein today Im going to get choked up
because this is my first pet and she passed away two years ago And I decided to break from I dont
really write about my public life because I wanted to give her
a little memorial But anyways its these sorts
of personal stories  You know you read the blogs
about politics or about media and gossip and all these things These are out there but its more of the personal
that interests me and this is who I am You see Norman Rockwell
and you have art critics say Norman Rockwell is not art Norman Rockwell hangs
in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not something
to be considered high art And I think this is one
of the most important things to us as humans These things resonate with us and if you think about blogs
you think of high art blogs the history paintings about
you know all the biblical stories and then you have this These are the blogs that interest me
the people that just tell stories One story is about this baby
and his name is Odin His father was a blogger And he was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth to her baby at  weeks And he never expected this One day it was normal
the next day it was hell And this is a onepound baby So Odin was documented every single day Pictures were taken every day
day one day two  You have day nine 
theyre talking about his apnea day   he gets pneumonia His baby is so small and Ive never encountered such a  just  a disturbing image
but just so heartfelt And youre reading this as it happens so on day  everybody reads
that hes having failures breathing failures and heart failures and its slowing down
and you dont know what to expect But then it gets better
Day  he goes home And you see this post Thats not something youre going
to see in a paper or magazine but this is something this person feels and people are excited
about it   comments Thats not a huge amount
of people reading but  people matter And today he is a healthy baby who if you read his blog  its snowdealorg his fathers blog  he is taking pictures of him still
because he is still his son and he is I think
at his age level right now because he had received such
great treatment from the hospital So blogs So what Youve probably
heard these things before We talked about the WELL
and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history But I think blogs are basically
just an evolution and thats where we are today Its this record
of who you are your persona You have your Google search
where you say What is Mena Trott And then you find these things
and youre happy or unhappy But then you also find peoples blogs and those are the records of people
that are writing daily  not necessarily about the same topic
but things that interest them And we talk about the world
flattens being in this panel and I am very optimistic 
whenever I think about blogs Im like Weve got to reach
all these people Hundreds of millions
and billions of people Were getting into China
we want to be there but there are so many people that
wont have the access to write a blog But to see something
like the  computer is amazing because blogging software is simple We have a successful company
because of timing and because of perseverance
but its simple stuff  its not rocket science And so thats an amazing
thing to consider So  the life record of a blog is something
that I find incredibly important And we started with a slide of my Teds and I had to add this slide because I knew the minute
I showed this my mom  my mom will see this
because she does read my blog and shell say Why wasnt there
a picture of me This is my mom So I have all the people that I know of But this is basically the extent
of the family that I know in terms of my direct line I showed a Norman Rockwell painting
before and this one I grew up with looking at constantly I would spend hours
looking at the connections saying Oh the little kid
up at the top has red hair so does that first generation up there And its just these little things This is not science
but this was enough for me to be really interested
in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line So that has always influenced me I have this record this  census of another Grabowski 
thats my maiden name  and theres a Theodore
because theres always a Theodore This is all I have
a couple of facts about somebody I have their date of birth their age
what they did in their household if they spoke English and thats it thats all I know
of these people And its pretty sad because I only go back
five generations and thats it I dont even know what happens
on my moms side because shes from Cuba
and I dont have that many things Just doing this
I spent time in the archives  thats why my husbands a saint  I spent time in the Washington archives just sitting there
looking for these things Now its online but he sat through that And so you have this record and  This is my greatgreatgrandmother This is the only picture I have And to think of what we have the ability
to do with our blogs to think about the people
that are on those  computers talking about who they are
sharing these personal stories  this is an amazing thing Another photo that has
greatly influenced me or a series of photos is this project thats done by an Argentinean
man and his wife And hes basically taking a picture
of his family every day for the past what is    
Oh my God Im    years Twentynine years There was a joke originally
about my graph that I left out which is You see all this math Im just happy I was able
to add it up to  because thats my skill set So you have these people aging and now this is them today or last year And thats a powerful thing
to have to be able to track this I wish that I would have
this of my family I know that one day my children
will be wondering  or my grandchildren
or my greatgrandchildren if I ever have children  what I am going to  who I was So I do something
thats very narcissistic  I am a blogger  that is an amazing thing for me because it captures
a moment in time every day I take a picture of myself 
Ive been doing this since last year  every single day And you know its the same picture its basically the same person Only a couple of people read it I dont write this for this audience Im showing it now but I would go
insane if this was really public About four people probably read it and they tell me You havent updated Im probably going to get people
telling me I havent updated But this is amazing because I can
go back to a day  to April  and say what was I doing this day I look at it I know exactly Its this visual cue
that is so important to what we do I put the bad pictures up too because there are bad pictures And I remember instantly
I am in Germany in this  I had to go for a oneday trip I was sick and I was in a hotel room and I wanted not to be there And so you see these things
its not just always smiling Now Ive kind of evolved it
so I have this look If you look at my drivers license
I have the same look and its a pretty disturbing thing but its something
that is really important And the last story
I really want to tell is this story because this is probably the one
that means the most to me in all of what Im doing Ill probably get choked up
because I tend to when I talk about this So this woman her name was Emma and she was a blogger
on our service TypePad And she was a beta tester
so she was there right when we opened  you know there was  people And she wrote about her life
dealing with cancer She was writing and writing
and we all started reading it because we had
so few blogs on the service we could keep track of everyone And she was writing one day and then she disappeared for a little bit And her sister came on and she said
that Emma had passed away And all of our support staff who had
talked to her were really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company And this was one of those
instances where I realized how much blogging
affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world That this woman is in England and she lives  she lived  a life where she was talking
about what she was doing But the big thing
that really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said  and she wrote on this blog  that writing her blog during
the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing
that had happened to her and being able to talk to people
and to share what was going on and being able to write
and receive comments And that was amazing to be able to know
that we had empowered that and that blogging was something
that she felt comfortable doing and the idea that blogging
doesnt have to be scary that we dont always have
to be attack of the blogs that we can be people who are open
and wanting to help and talk to people That was an amazing thing And so I printed out and sent
a PDF of her blog to her family and they passed it
out at her memorial service and even in her obituary
they mentioned her blog because it was such
a big part of her life And thats a huge thing So this is her legacy and I think that my call to action
to all of you is think about blogs
think about what they are think about what youve thought of them and then actually do it because its something
thats really going to change our lives So thank you ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
22,"Im Michael Shermer
director of the Skeptics Society publisher of Skeptic magazine We investigate claims of the paranormal pseudoscience fringe groups and cults
and claims of all kinds between science and pseudoscience
and nonscience and junk science voodoo science pathological science
bad science nonscience and plain old nonsense And unless youve been on Mars recently you know theres a lot of that out there Some people call us debunkers
which is kind of a negative term But lets face it theres a lot of bunk We are like the bunko squads
of the police departments out there  well were sort of like
the Ralph Naders of bad ideas trying to replace bad ideas
with good ideas Ill show you an example of a bad idea I brought this with me this was given to us
by NBC Dateline to test Its produced by the Quadro
Corporation of West Virginia Its called the Quadro  Dowser Rod This was being sold to highschool
administrators for  apiece Its a piece of plastic with a Radio
Shack antenna attached to it You could dowse for all sorts of things but this particular one was built
to dowse for marijuana in students lockers So the way it works
is you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts
toward a particular locker and then you open the locker So it looks something like this Ill show you Well it has kind of a rightleaning bias Well this is science
so well do a controlled experiment Itll go this way for sure Sir do you want to empty
your pockets please sir So the question was can it actually
find marijuana in students lockers And the answer is
if you open enough of them yes But in science we have to keep track
of the misses not just the hits And thats probably the key lesson
to my short talk here This is how psychics work astrologers
tarot card readers and so on People remember the hits
and forget the misses In science we keep the whole database and look to see if the number
of hits somehow stands out from the total number
youd expect by chance In this case we tested it We had two opaque boxes one with governmentapproved THC
marijuana and one with nothing And it got it  percent of the time  which is exactly what youd expect
with a coinflip model So thats just a fun little example
here of the sorts of things we do Skeptic is the quarterly publication
Each one has a particular theme This one is on the future of intelligence Are people getting smarter or dumber I have an opinion of this myself
because of the business Im in but in fact people it turns out
are getting smarter Three IQ points per  years going up Sort of an interesting thing With science dont think of skepticism
as a thing or science as a thing Are science and religion compatible Its like are science
and plumbing compatible Theyre just two different things Science is not a thing Its a verb Its a way of thinking about things Its a way of looking for natural
explanations for all phenomena I mean whats more likely that extraterrestrial intelligences
or multidimensional beings travel across vast distances
of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bobs
field in Puckerbrush Kansas to promote skepticcom our web page Or is it more likely that a reader
of Skeptic did this with Photoshop And in all cases we have to ask  Whats the more likely explanation Before we say something
is out of this world we should first make sure
that its not in this world Whats more likely that Arnold had extraterrestrial help
in his run for the governorship or that the World Weekly News
makes stuff up The same theme is expressed nicely
here in this Sidney Harris cartoon For those of you in the back
it says here Then a miracle occurs I think you need to be more
explicit here in step two This single slide completely dismantles
the intelligent design arguments Theres nothing more to it than that You can say a miracle occurs its just that it doesnt explain
anything or offer anything Theres nothing to test Its the end of the conversation
for intelligent design creationists And its true scientists sometimes throw
terms out as linguistic place fillers  dark energy or dark matter
something like that  until we figure out what it is
well call it this Its the beginning of the causal
chain for science For intelligent design creationists
its the end of the chain So again we can ask this
whats more likely Are UFOs alien spaceships or perceptual
cognitive mistakes or even fakes This is a UFO shot from my house
in Altadena California looking down over Pasadena And if it looks a lot like a Buick
hubcap its because it is You dont even need Photoshop
or hightech equipment you dont need computers This was shot with a throwaway
Kodak Instamatic camera You just have somebody off on the side
with a hubcap ready to go Cameras ready  thats it So although its possible
that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on
and that some of them are real its more likely that all of them
are fake like the crop circles On a more serious note in all of science
were looking for a balance between data and theory In the case of Galileo
he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn First of all there was no
theory of planetary rings Second of all his data
was grainy and fuzzy and he couldnt quite make out
what he was looking at So he wrote that he had seen  I have observed that the furthest
planet has three bodies And this is what he ended up
concluding that he saw So without a theory of planetary
rings and with only grainy data you cant have a good theory It wasnt solved until  This is Christiaan Huygenss book
that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out
what was going on with Saturn It wasnt till Huygens had two things He had a good theory of planetary rings
and how the solar system operated and he had better telescopic
more finegrain data in which he could figure out that
as the Earth is going around faster  according to Keplers Laws 
than Saturn then we catch up with it And we see the angles of the rings
at different angles there And that in fact turns out to be true The problem with having a theory is that
it may be loaded with cognitive biases So one of the problems of explaining
why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level and then Ill go to more serious ones Like we have a tendency to see faces This is the face on Mars In  where there was a whole movement
to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental
architecture made by Martians Heres the closeup of it from  If you squint you can still see the face And when youre squinting youre turning that from finegrain
to coarsegrain so youre reducing
the quality of your data And if I didnt tell you what to look for
youd still see the face because were programmed
by evolution to see faces Faces are important for us socially And of course happy faces
faces of all kinds are easy to see You see the happy face on Mars there If astronomers were frogs
perhaps theyd see Kermit the Frog Do you see him there Little froggy legs Or if geologists were elephants Religious iconography Discovered by a Tennessee baker in  He charged five bucks a head
to come see the nun bun till he got a ceaseanddesist
from Mother Teresas lawyer Heres Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our
Lady of Watsonville just down the street or is it up the street from here Tree bark is particularly good
because its nice and grainy branchy blackandwhite splotchy and you can
get the patternseeking  humans are patternseeking animals Heres the Virgin Mary on the side
of a glass window in Sao Paulo Heres when the Virgin Mary made
her appearance on a cheese sandwich  which I got to actually
hold in a Las Vegas casino  of course this being America This casino paid 
on eBay for the cheese sandwich But who does it really look like
The Virgin Mary It has that sort of
puckered lips sera look Virgin Mary in Clearwater Florida I actually went to see this one There was a lot of people there The faithful come in their wheelchairs
and crutches and so on We went down and investigated Just to give you a size thats Dawkins
me and The Amazing Randi next to this two
two and a half storysized image All these candles thousands of candles
people had lit in tribute to this So we walked around the backside
to see what was going on It turns out wherever theres
a sprinkler head and a palm tree you get the effect Heres the Virgin Mary on the backside
which they started to wipe off I guess you can only have
one miracle per building So is it really a miracle of Mary
or is it a miracle of Marge And now Im going to finish up
with another example of this with auditory illusions Theres this film White Noise
with Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to us By the way the whole business of talking
to the dead is not that big a deal Anybody can do it turns out Its getting the dead to talk
back thats the really hard part In this case supposedly these messages
are hidden in electronic phenomena Theres a ReverseSpeechcom web page
where I downloaded this stuff This is the most famous one
of all of these Heres the forward version
of the very famous song Music with lyrics If theres a bustle in your hedgerow
dont be alarmed now Its just a spring clean
for the May Queen Yes there are two paths you
can go by but in the long run Theres still time to change
the road youre on Music ends Couldnt you just listen to that all day All right here it is backwards and see if you can hear the hidden
messages that are supposedly in there Music with unintelligible lyrics Lyrics Satan Unintelligible lyrics continue What did you get
Audience Satan Satan OK at least we got Satan Now Ill prime the auditory
part of your brain to tell you what youre supposed
to hear and then hear it again Music with lyrics Music ends You cant miss it
when I tell you whats there Im going to just end
with a positive nice little story The Skeptics is a nonprofit
educational organization Were always looking for little
good things that people do And in England theres a pop singer One of the top popular singers
in England today Katie Melua And she wrote a beautiful song It was in the top five in  called
Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing Its a love story  shes sort
of the Norah Jones of the UK  about how she much loves her guy and compared to nine million
bicycles and so forth And she has this one passage here Music Lyrics We are  billion
lightyears from the edge Thats a guess No one can ever say its true But I know that I will always be with you Michael Shermer Well thats nice
At least she got it close In America itd be
Were  light years from the edge But my friend Simon Singh the particle
physicist now turned science educator who wrote the book
The Big Bang and so on uses every chance he gets
to promote good science And so he wrote an oped piece
in The Guardian about Katies song in which he said well we know exactly
how far from the edge You know its  billion light years
and its not a guess We know within precise
error bars how close it is So we can say although not absolutely
true its pretty close to being true And to his credit Katie called him up
after this oped piece came out and said Im so embarrassed
I was in the astronomy club I shouldve known better And she recut the song So I will end with the new version Music with lyrics We are  billion light years from the edge of the observable universe Thats a good estimate
with welldefined error bars And with the available information I predict that I will always be with you How cool is that ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23,I love trees and Im very lucky because we live near a wonderful arboretum and Sundays usually Id go there with my wife and now with my fouryearold and wed climb in the trees wed play hide and seek The second school I was at had big trees too had a fantastic tulip tree I think it was the biggest in the country and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it around the playing fields One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates and taken in the bushes  I was stripped I was attacked I was abused and this came out of the blue Now the reason I say that because afterwards I was thinking  well I went back into the school  I felt dirty I felt betrayed I felt ashamed but mainly  mainly I felt powerless And  years later I was sitting in an airplane next to a lady called Veronica who came from Chile and we were on a human rights tour and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured and from my very privileged position this was the only reference point that I had And it was an amazing learning experience because for me human rights have been something in which I had you know a parttime interest but mainly it was something that happened to other people over there But I got a phone call from Bono in  and as you know hes a great singer but hes a magnificent hustler and  Laughter  a very hard guy to say no to and he was saying you know just after Id done the Biko song were going to do a tour for Amnesty you have to be on it and really that was the first time that Id been out and started meeting people whod watched their family being shot in front of them whod had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world and I couldnt really walk away in quite the same way as before So I got involved with this tour which was for Amnesty and then in  I took over Bonos job trying to learn how to hustle I didnt do it as well but we managed to get Youssou NDour Sting Tracy Chapman and Bruce Springsteen to go round the world for Amnesty and it was an amazing experience And once again I got an extraordinary education and it was the first time really that Id met a lot of these people in the different countries and these human rights stories became very physical and again I couldnt really walk away quite so comfortably But the thing that really amazed me that I had no idea was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience your story denied buried and forgotten And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around or a video or film camera it was a great deal harder to do  for those in power to bury the story And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then  well we made a proposal for a couple of years about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists It didnt really get anywhere and then the Rodney King incident happened and people thought OK if you have a camera in the right place at the right time or perhaps the wrong time depending who you are then you can actually start doing something and campaigning and being heard and telling people about whats going on So WITNESS was started in  and its since given cameras out in over  countries And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and in fact I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns and Im afraid its a story from Uganda and although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday this one isnt quite so good In the north of Uganda there are something like  million internally displaced people people who are not refugees in another country but because of the civil war which has been going on for about  years they have nowhere to live And  kids have been taken away to become child soldiers and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the  now whats it called I forget the name of the of the army  its Lords Resistance Army I believe  but the government also doesnt have a clean sheet so if we could run the first video Music Woman Life in the camp is never simple Even today life is difficult We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp  still exists back home Text Between Two Fires Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda Man When we were at home it was Konys rebel soldiers disturbing us At first we were safe in the camp But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot Chanting Jennifer A soldier walked onto the road asking where wed been Evelyn and I hid behind my mother Evelyn He ordered us to sit down so we sat down The other soldier also came Jennifer The man came and started undressing me The other one carried Evelyn aside The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also Man The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession They kept telling us Tell the truth as they beat us Woman They insisted that I was lying At that moment they fired and shot off my fingers I fell They ran to join the others  leaving me for dead Music Text Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in  Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession to punish coerce or intimidate Peter Gabriel So torture is not something that always happens on other soil In my country it was  we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis weve got Abu Ghraib weve got Guantanamo Bay I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport and he told me a story that in the middle of the night  am hed been taken out of his home in Queens  taken to a place in the Midwest that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later because he had the same  he was Middle Eastern and he had the same name as one of the  pilots and that may or may not be true  I didnt think he was a liar though And I think if we look around the world as well as the polar ice caps melting human rights which have been fought for for many hundreds of years in some cases are also eroding very fast and that is something that we need to take a look at and maybe start campaigning for I mean here too one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project  they have managed with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed and its much  much  I think more humane methods are being looked at how you should lock up young kids and thats questionable to start off And as the story of Mr Morales just down the road excuse me Mr Gabriel would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit No not at all no problem take your time But this surely whoever that man is whatever hes done this is cruel and unusual punishment Anyway WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world with cameras and Id like to show you just a little more of that Thank you Thunder Text You can say a story is fabricated Music Text You can say a jury is corrupt You can say a person is lying You can say you dont trust newspapers But you cant say what you just saw never happened Help WITNESS give cameras to the world Shoot a video expose injustice reveal the truth show us whats wrong with the world and maybe we can help make it right WITNESS All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS PG WITNESS was born of technological innovation  in a sense the small portable DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being And weve also been trying to get computers out to the world so that groups can communicate much more effectively campaign much more effectively but now we have the wonderful possibility which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it because that is cheap its ubiquitous and its moving fast all around the world  and its very exciting for us And so the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded being seen being watched that they really know that they can be heard that there would be a giant website maybe a little like Google Earth and you could fly over and find out the realities of whats going for the worlds inhabitants In a way what this technology is allowing is really that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face that we can actually see whos dying of AIDS or whos being beaten up for the first time and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture  if we can move that into these sort of fields I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways There could be a new movement growing up rising from the ground reaching for the light and growing strong just like a tree Thank you ,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25,"Im Rich Baraniuk and what Id like
to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think
have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been
talked about the last two days So many different points of resonance that its going to be difficult
to bring them all up but Ill try to do my best Does anybody remember these OK so these are LP records
and theyve been replaced right Theyve been swept away
over the last two decades by these types of worldflattening
digitization technologies right And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music
as we came in the room today Whats happened in the music world
is theres a culture or an ecosystem thats been created that if you take some words from Apple the catchphrase 
that we create rip mix and burn What I mean by that is that anyone
in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas Anyone in the world is allowed
to rip or copy musical ideas use them in innovative ways Anyone is allowed to mix them
in different types of ways draw connections between musical ideas and people can burn them or create
final products and continue the circle And what thats done
is its created like I said a vibrant community thats very inclusive with people continually working
to connect musical ideas innovate them and keep things
constantly up to date Todays hit single
is not last years hit single But Im not here
to talk about music today Im here to talk about books In particular textbooks
and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school Has anyone here ever been to school OK does anybody realize
theres a crisis in our schools around the world Im not going to spend
too much time on that but what I want to talk about
is some of the disconnects that appear when an author
publishes a book That in fact the publishing process  just because of the fact
that its complicated its heavy books are expensive  creates a sort of a wall
between authors of books and the ultimate users of books be they teachers students
or just general readers And this is even more true
if you happen to speak a language other than one of the worlds
major languages and especially English Im going to call these people
below the barrier shutouts because theyre really
shut out of the process of being able to share
their knowledge with the world And so what I want to talk about today
is trying to take these ideas that weve seen in the musical culture and try to bring these
towards reinventing the way we think about writing books
using them and teaching from them So thats what Id like to talk about and really how we get
from where we are now to where we need to go The first thing Id like you to do
is a little thought experiment Imagine taking all the worlds books OK everybody imagine books
and imagine just tearing out the pages So liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them
and then storing them in a vast interconnected
global repository Think of it as a massive iTunes
for booktype content And then take that material
and imagine making it all open so that people can modify it
play with it improve it Imagine making it free so that anyone in the world can have
access to all of this knowledge and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content
improve it play with it on a timescale thats more
on the order of seconds instead of years Instead of editions of a book
coming out every two years imagine them coming out every  seconds So imagine we could do that
and imagine we could put people into this So that we could truly build
an ecosystem with not just authors but all the people
who could be or want to be authors in all the different
languages of the world and I think if you could do this
it would be called  Im just going to refer to it
as a knowledge ecosystem So really this is the dream and in a sense what you can think of it is were trying
to enable anyone in the world I mean anyone in the world  to be their own educational DJ creating educational materials
sharing them with the world constantly innovating on them So this is the dream In fact this dream
is actually being realized Over the last sixandahalf years weve been working really hard
at Rice University on a project called Connexions and so what Id like to do
for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing
with Connexions which you can kind of
think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negropontes talk yesterday where theyre working on the hardware
of bringing education to the world Were working on the opensource tools and the content So thats sort of
to put it in perspective here So create What are some of the people
that are using these kind of tools Well the first thing is theres a community
of engineering professors from Cambridge to Kyoto who are developing engineering content
in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of
as a massive super textbook that covers the entire area
of electrical engineering And not only that  it can be customized for use in each
of their own individual institutions If people like Kitty Jones a shutout  a private music teacher and mom
from Champagne Illinois who wanted to share her fantastic
music content with the world on how to teach kids how to play music  Her material is now used
over  times per month Tremendous use In fact a lot of this use coming
from United States K schools because anyone whos involved
in a school scale back the first thing thats cut
is the music curriculum And so this is just indicating
the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free content A lot of teachers are using this stuff What about ripping
What about copying reusing A team of volunteers
at the University of Texas at El Paso  graduate students translating
this engineering super textbook ideas And within about a week having this be some
of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America
and in particular in Mexico because of the open
extensible nature of this People volunteers and even companies that are translating materials
into Asian languages like Chinese Japanese and Thai to spread the knowledge even further OK what about people who are mixing What does mixing mean Mixing means
building customized courses means building customized books Companies like National Instruments who are embedding very powerful
interactive simulations into the materials so that we can go way beyond
our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials
are things you can actually interact with and play around with
and actually learn as you do Weve been working
with Teachers Without Borders who are very interested
in mixing our materials Theyre going to be using
Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials
for teaching teachers how to teach in  countries around the world TWB is currently in Iraq training  teachers
supported by USAID And to them this idea
of being able to remix and customize to the local context
is extraordinarily important because just providing
free content to people has actually been likened
by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism  that if you dont empower people with the ability
to recontextualize the material translate it into their own language
and take ownership of it its not good OK other organizations
weve been working with UC Merced  people know about UC Merced Its a new university in California
in the Central Valley working very closely
with community colleges Theyre actually developing a lot of their science
and engineering curriculum to spread widely
around the world in our system And theyre also trying to develop
all of their software tools completely opensource Weve been working with AMD
which has a project called x which is trying to bring
Internet connectivity to  percent of the worlds
population by  Were going to be
providing content to them in a whole range of different languages And weve also been working
with a number of other organizations In particular a bunch of the projects
that are funded by Hewlett Foundation who have taken a real leadership role
in this area of open content OK burn  I think
this is sort of quite interesting Burn is the idea of trying
to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses And I think a lot of you received  I think all of you received one
of these music books in your gift pack A little present for you Just to tell you quickly about it
this is an engineering textbook Its about  pages long hardbound This costs  anybody guess How much would it cost in a bookstore Audience  dollars Richard Baraniuk
OK This costs  dollars to the student Why does it cost  dollars Because its published on demand and its developed
from this repository of open materials If this book were to be published
by a regular publisher it would cost at least  dollars So what were seeing is moving this burning
or publication process from the regular
sort of singleauthored book towards communityauthored materials that are modular that are customized
to each individual class and published on demand
very inexpensively either pushed out through Amazon or published directly
through an ondemand press like QOOP And I think that this is
an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area
under this long tail in publishing Were not talking
about the Harry Potter end right at the left side Were talking about books on hypergeometric
partial differential equations Books that might sell
 copies a year  copies a year There is tremendous
sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours but also to sustain this new emergence
of ondemand publishers like QOOP who produced these two books And I think one of the things
that you should take away from this talk is that theres an impending
cutoutthemiddleman disintermediation thats going to be happening
in the publishing industry And its going to reach a crescendo
over the next few years and I think that its for our benefit
really and for the worlds benefit OK so what are the enablers Whats really making all of this happen Theres tons of technology and the only piece of technology
that I really want to talk about is XML How many people know about XML Oh great So its the future of the web right Its semantic representation of content And what you can really
think of XML in this case is its the packaging
that were putting around these pages Remember we took the book
tore the pages out Well what the XML is going to do is its going to turn those pages
into Lego blocks XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content
together in a myriad different ways and it provides us a framework
to share content So it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state
of all this content all the pages youve torn out of books and create highly sophisticated
learning machines books courses course packs It gives you the ability
to personalize the learning experience to each individual student so that every student
can have a book or a course thats customized to their
learning style their context their language and the things
that excite them It lets you reuse the same materials
in multiple different ways and surprising new ways It lets you interconnect ideas indicating how fields
relate to each other And Ill just give you my personal story We came up with this
sixandahalf years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box And my day job as Chris said 
Im an electrical engineering professor I teach signal processing and my challenge
was to show that this math  Wow about half of you
have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation But this seemingly dry math is actually the center
of this tremendously powerful web that links technology  that links really cool applications
like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities but also governed
by intellectual property And the thing that I realized is there was no way
that I as an engineer could write this book
that would get all of this across We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools
to be able to interconnect these ideas And I think that really
in a sense what were trying to do is make Minskys dream come to a reality where you can imagine
all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other And people who are teachers out here 
whoever taught you know this  its the interconnections between ideas
that teaching is really all about OK back to math Imagine  this is possible that every single equation that you
click on in one of your new etexts is something that youre going to be able
to explore and experiment with So imagine your kids
algebra textbook in seventh grade You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool
to be able to experiment with it tinker with it understand it Because we really
dont understand until we do The same type of markup
like MathML for chemistry Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure
of how molecules are formed Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve
into the semantic structure of music play with it understand it Its no wonder that everybodys
getting into it right Even the three wise men OK the second big enabler
and this is where I told a big lie The second big enabler
is intellectual property Because in fact I got up here and I talked about how great
the music culture is We can share and rip mix and burn
but in fact thats all illegal And we would be accused
of piracy for doing that because this music has been propertized Its now owned
much of it by big industries So really the key thing here
is we cant let this happen We cant let this
Napster thing happen here So what we have to do
is get it right from the very beginning And what we have to do
is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe
and makes it easily understandable And the inspiration here
is taken from opensource software Things like Linux and the GPL The Creative Commons licenses How many people
have heard of creative commons If you have not you must learn about it Creativecommonsorg At the bottom of every piece
of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects you can find their logo Clicking on that logo
takes you to an absolute nononsense humanreadable document a deed that tells you exactly
what you can do with this content In fact youre free to share it
to do all of these things to copy it to change it
even to make commercial use of it as long as you attribute the author Because in academic publishing
and much of educational publishing its really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact Thats why people write
not necessarily making bucks Were not talking
about Harry Potter right Were at the long tail end here Behind that is the legal code
very carefully constructed And Creative Commons is taking off  over  million things out there licensed with a Creative Commons license Not just text but music images video And theres actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people
that are actually licensing music to make it free for people
who do this whole idea of resampling ripping mixing burning and sharing OK Id like to conclude
with just the last few points So weve built this idea of a commons People are using it We get over  unique visitors
per month just to our particular site MIT OpenCourseWare
which is another large opencontent site gets a similar number of hits But how do we protect this How do we protect it into the future And the first thing
that people are probably thinking is quality control right Because were saying that anybody
can contribute things to this commons Anybody can contribute anything So that could be a problem It didnt take long until people
started contributing materials for example on lingerie which is actually a pretty good module The only problem is its plagiarized
from a major French feminist journal and when you go
to the supposed course website it points to a lingerieselling website So this is a little bit of a problem So we clearly need some kind
of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea
of review and peer review comes in You come to TED Why do you come to TED Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are
very very high quality right And so we need to be able
to do the same thing And we need to be able
to design structures and what were doing
is designing social software to enable anyone to build
their own peer review process and we call these things lenses And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop
their own peerreview process so that they can focus
on the content in the repository that they think is really important And you can think of TED
as a potential lens So Id just like to end by saying you can really view this
as a call to action Connexions and open content
is all about sharing knowledge All of you here are tremendously imbued
with tremendous amounts of knowledge and what Id like to do
is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project
and other projects of its type because I think together
we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing So thanks very much ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

27,"My name is Lovegrove I only know nine Lovegroves
two of which are my parents They are first cousins and you know
what happens when you know  So theres a terribly weird
freaky side to me which Im fighting with all the time So to try and get through today Ive kind of disciplined myself
with an minute talk I was hanging on to have a pee I thought perhaps
if I was hanging on long enough that would guide me
through the  minutes OK I am known as Captain Organic and thats a philosophical position
as well as an aesthetic position But today what Id like to talk
to you about is that love of form and how form can touch
peoples soul and emotion Not very long ago
not many thousands of years ago we actually lived in caves and I dont think
weve lost that coding system We respond so well to form But Im interested
in creating intelligent form Im not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish
that you see coming out as design This artificially induced
consumerism  I think its atrocious My world is the world
of people like Amory Lovins Janine Benyus James Watson Im in that world
but I work purely instinctively Im not a scientist
I could have been perhaps but I work in this world
where I trust my instincts So I am a stcentury
translator of technology into products that we use everyday
and relate beautifully and naturally with And we should be developing things 
we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate
peoples perceptions and respect for the things
that we dig out of the earth and translate into products
for everyday use So the water bottle Ill begin with this concept
of what I call DNA DNA Design Nature Art These are the three things
that condition my world Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci
 years ago before photography It shows how observation
curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art Industrial design is the art form
of the st century People like Leonardo 
there have not been many  had this amazingly instinctive curiosity I work from a similar position I dont want to sound
pretentious saying that but this is my drawing made
on a digital pad a couple of years ago  well into the st century
 years later Its my impression of water Impressionism being the most valuable
art form on the planet as we know it  million dollars easily for a Monet I use now a whole new process A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn
Thom Mayne Zaha Hadid Rem Koolhaas  all these people that I think
are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas
of how to create form This is all created digitally Here you see the machining
the milling of a block of acrylic This is what I show to the client to say
Thats what I want to do At that point I dont know
if thats possible at all Its a seductor but I just feel
in my bones that thats possible So we go we look at the tooling We look at how that is produced These are the invisible things
that you never see in your life This is the background noise
of industrial design That is like an Anish Kapoor
flowing through a Richard Serra It is more valuable
than the product in my eyes I dont have one When I do make some money
Ill have one machined for myself This is the final product When they sent it to me
I thought Id failed It felt like nothing
It has to feel like nothing It was when I put the water in that I realized that Id put
a skin on water itself Its an icon of water itself and it elevates peoples perception
of contemporary design Each bottle is different meaning the water level
will give you a different shape Its mass individualism
from a single product It fits the hand It fits arthritic hands
It fits childrens hands It makes the product strong
the tessellation Its a millefiori of ideas In the future they will look like that because we need to move away
from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things
perhaps in life Biopolymers these new
ideas for materials will come into play in probably a decade It doesnt look as cool does it But I can live up to that
I dont have a problem with that I design for that condition
biopolymers Its the future I took this video in Cape Town last year This is the freaky side coming out I have this special interest
in things like this which blow my mind I dont know whether to
you know drop to my knees cry I dont know what I think But I just know that nature  nature improves with evergreater purpose that which once existed and that strangeness
is a consequence of innovative thinking When I look at these things
they look pretty normal to me But these things evolved over many years
and what were trying to do  I get three weeks to design a telephone
How the hell do I do that when you get these things that take
hundreds of millions of years to evolve How do you condense that It comes back to instinct Im not talking about designing
telephones that look like that and Im not looking
at designing architecture like that Im just interested
in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms
that only nature really creates How that flows through me
and how that comes out is what Im trying to understand This is a scan through the human forearm Its then blown up
through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure I have these in my office My office is a mixture
of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab Its a weird kind of freaky place This is one of my specimens This is made  bone is made from a mixture
of inorganic minerals and polymers I studied cooking in school
for four years and in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me
to try and get a science qualification Actually I put marijuana
in everything I cooked  And I had access to all
the best girls It was fabulous All the guys in the rugby team
couldnt understand Anyway  this is a meringue This is another sample I have A meringue is made exactly the same way
in my estimation as a bone Its made from
polysaccharides and proteins If you pour water on that it dissolves Could we be manufacturing
from foodstuffs in the future Not a bad idea I dont know I need to talk to Janine
and a few other people about that but I believe instinctively that
that meringue can become something a car  I dont know Im also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things so youre not restricted by form at all These interrelated forms
they do inspire everything I do although I might end up
making something incredibly simple This is a detail of a chair
that Ive designed in magnesium It shows this interlocution of elements
and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking shown pretty much as a bone structure Any one of those elements
you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object Its the worlds first chair
made in magnesium It cost  million dollars to develop Its called Go by Bernhardt USA It went into Time magazine in 
as the new language of the st century Boy For somebody growing up in Wales
in a little village thats enough It shows how you make one holistic form
like the car industry and then you break up what you need This is an absolutely
beautiful way of working Its a godly way of working Its organic and its essential Its an absolutely fatfree design and when you look at it
you see human beings When that moves into polymers you can change the elasticity
the fluidity of the form This is an idea for a gasinjected
onepiece polymer chair What nature does
is it drills holes in things It liberates form It takes away anything extraneous Thats what I do I make organic things which are essential And they look funky too 
but I dont set out to make funky things because I think
thats an absolute disgrace I set out to look at natural forms If you took the idea of fractal technology
further take a membrane shrinking it down constantly
like nature does  that could be a seat for a chair It could be a sole for a sports shoe It could be a car blending into seats Wow Lets go for it
Thats the kind of stuff This is what exists in nature Observation now allows us
to bring that natural process into the design process every day Thats what I do This is a show
thats currently on in Tokyo Its called Superliquidity
Its my sculptural investigation Its like stcentury Henry Moore When you see a Henry Moore still
your hair stands up Theres some amazing spiritual connect If he was a car designer
phew wed all be driving one In his day he was
the highest taxpayer in Britain That is the power of organic design It contributes immensely to our  sense of being our sense of relationships with things our sensuality and
you know the sort of  even the sort of socioerotic side
which is very important This is my artwork
This is all my process These actually are sold as artwork
Theyre very big prints But this is how I get to that object Ironically that object was made
by the Killarney process which is a brandnew process here
for the st century and I can hear Greg Lynn
laughing his socks off as I say that Ill tell you about that later When I look into these data images I see new things Its selfinspired Diatomic structures radiolaria the things that we couldnt see
but we can do now  these again are cored out Theyre made virtually from nothing
Theyre made from silica Why not structures from cars like that Coral all these natural forces take away what they dont need
and they deliver maximum beauty We need to be in that realm I want to do stuff like that This is a new chair which should
come on the market in September Its for a company called Moroso in Italy
Its a gasinjected polymer chair Those holes you see there
are very filtereddown watereddown versions of the extremity
of the diatomic structures It goes with the flow
of the polymer and youll see  theres an image coming up
right now that shows the full thing Its great to have companies in Italy
who support this way of dreaming If you see the shadows
that come through that theyre actually probably
more important than the product but its the minimum it takes The coring out of the back
lets you breathe It takes away any material you dont need and it actually garners flexure too I was going to break into a dance then This is some current work Im doing Im looking at singlesurface structures and how they stretch and flow Its based on furniture typologies
but thats not the end motivation Its made from aluminum  as opposed to aluminium and its grown Its grown in my mind and then its grown in terms
of the whole process that I go through This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry
who build parts for Bentleys and so on Its being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips
next year in New York I have a big show
with Phillips Auctioneers When I see these animations
oh Jesus Im blown away This is what goes on
in my studio everyday I walk  Im traveling I come back Some guys got that on a computer 
theres this like oh my goodness So I try to create this energy
of invention every day in my studio This kind of effervescent  fully charged sense of soup
that delivers ideas Singlesurface products Furnitures a good one How you grow legs out of a surface I would love to build this one day and perhaps Id like
to build it also out of flour sugar polymer wood chips 
I dont know human hair I dont know Id love a go at that
I dont know If I just got some time Thats the weird side coming out again
A lot of companies dont understand that Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo They said Give us the dream
What is our dream How do we beat Apple I said You dont copy Apple
thats for sure You get into biopolymers They looked straight through me What a waste Anyway No its true Fuck them
You know I mean  Im delivering theyre not taking Ive had this image  years Ive had this image of a water droplet
for  years sitting on a hot bed That is an image of a car for me Thats the car of the future
Its a water droplet Ive been banging on about this
like I cant believe Cars are all wrong Im going to show you
something a bit weird now They laughed everywhere
over the world I showed this The only place
that didnt laugh was Moscow Cars are made from  components How ridiculous is that
Couldnt you make that from  Its got a vacuumformed
carbonnylon pan Everythings holistically integrated
It opens and closes like a bread bin There is no engine
Theres a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels
theyre fitted like Formula  You take them off your wall
you plug them in Off you go A threewheeled car slow feminine transparent so you can see
the people in there You drive different You see that thing You do You do And not anesthetized separated from life Theres a hole at the front
and theres a reason for that Its a city car
You drive along You get out You drive on to a proboscis You get out It lifts you up It presents the solar panel to the sun
and at night its a street lamp Thats what happens if you get inspired
by the street lamp first and do the car second I can see these bubbles
with these hydrogen packages floating around
on the ground driven by AI When I showed this in South Africa everybody afterwards was going
Hey car on a stick Like this Can you imagine A car on a stick If you put it next to
contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me And thats what I do with my furniture Im not putting Charles Eames
furniture in buildings anymore Im trying to build furniture
which fits architecture Im trying to build
transportation systems I work on aircraft for Airbus I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural
inspiredbynature dreams home Im going to finish on two things This is the stereolithography
of a staircase Its a little bit of a dedication
to James James Watson I built this thing for my studio It cost me  dollars to build this Most people go and buy the Aston Martin I built this This is the data that goes with that
Incredibly complex Took about two years
because Im looking for fatfree design Lean efficient things Healthy products This is built by composites Its a single element which rotates around
to create a holistic element and this is a carbonfiber handrail
which is only supported in two places Modern materials
allow us to do modern things This is a shot in the studio This is how it looks
pretty much every day You wouldnt want to have
a fear of heights coming down it There is virtually no handrail
It doesnt pass any standards Who cares And it has an internal handrail
which gives it its strength Its this holistic integration
Thats my studio Its subterranean Its in Notting Hill
next to all the crap  the prostitutes and all that stuff Its next to David Hockneys
original studio It has a lighting system
that changes throughout the day My guys go out for lunch
The doors open They come back in because its normally raining
and they prefer to stay in This is my studio Elephant skull
from Oxford University  I bought that last year
Theyre very difficult to find If anybodys got a whale skeleton
they want to sell me Ill put it in the studio So Im just going
to interject a little bit with some of the things
that youll see in the video Its a homemade video made it myself
at three oclock in the morning just to show you how my real world is You never see that You never see architects or designers
showing you their real world This is called a Plasnet Its a new biopolycarbonate chair
Im doing in Italy Worlds first bamboo bike
with folding handlebars We should all be riding one of these As China buys all these crappy cars
we should be riding things like this Counterbalance Like I say its a cross between Natural History Museum
and a NASA laboratory Its full of prototypes and objects Its selfinspirational again I mean the rare times when Im there I do enjoy it And I get lots and lots of kids coming Im a contaminator for all those children
of investment bankers  wankers Sorry Thats a solar seed
Its a concept for new architecture That thing on the top is the worlds
first solarpowered garden lamp  the first produced Giles Revell should be
talking here today  amazing photography
of things you cant see The first sculptural model
I made for that thing in Tokyo Lots of stuff
Theres a little leaf chair  that golden looking thing
is called Leaf Its made from Kevlar On the wall is my book
called Supernatural which allows me to remember
what Ive done because I forget Theres an aerated brick
I did in Limoges last year in Concepts for New Ceramics
in Architecture Gernot Oberfell working
at three oclock in the morning  and I dont pay overtime Overtime is the passion of design so join the club or dont No its true People like Tom and Greg  were traveling like you cant 
we fit it all in I dont know how we do it Next week Im at Electrolux in Sweden
then Im in Beijing on Friday You work that one out And when I see Eds photographs
I think why the hell am I going to China Its true Its true Because theres a soul
in this whole thing We need to have a new instinct
for the st century We need to combine all this stuff If all the people who were
talking over this period worked on a car together it would be a joy absolute joy So theres a new Xlight system
Im doing in Japan Theres Tuareg shoes from North Africa
Theres a Kifwebe mask These are my sculptures A copper jelly mold It sounds like some quiz show
or something doesnt it So its going to end Thank you James
for your great inspiration Thank you very much ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
28,"Im going to give you
four specific examples Im going to cover at the end about how a company called Silk
tripled their sales how an artist named Jeff Koons
went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money
and having a lot of impact to how Frank Gehry redefined
what it meant to be an architect And one of my biggest failures
as a marketer in the last few years  a record label I started
that had a CD called Sauce Before I can do that
Ive got to tell you about sliced bread and a guy named Otto Rohwedder Now before sliced bread
was invented in the s I wonder what they said Like the greatest invention
since the telegraph or something But this guy named Otto Rohwedder
invented sliced bread and he focused like most inventors did
on the patent part and the making part And the thing about the invention
of sliced bread is this  that for the first  years
after sliced bread was available no one bought it no one knew about it it was a complete and total failure And the reason
is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread
the idea of sliced bread no one wanted it That the success of sliced bread like the success of almost everything
weve talked about at this conference is not always about what the patent
is like or what the factory is like  its about can you get
your idea to spread or not And I think that the way
youre going to get what you want or cause the change that you want
to change to happen is to figure out a way
to get your ideas to spread And it doesnt matter to me
whether youre running a coffee shop or youre an intellectual
or youre in business or youre flying hot air balloons I think that all this stuff applies
to everybody regardless of what we do That what we are living in
is a century of idea diffusion That people who can spread ideas
regardless of what those ideas are win When I talk about it
I usually pick business because they make the best pictures
that you can put in your presentation and because its the easiest
sort of way to keep score But I want you to forgive me
when I use these examples because Im talking about anything
that you decide to spend your time to do At the heart of spreading ideas
is TV and stuff like TV TV and mass media made it really easy
to spread ideas in a certain way I call it the TVindustrial complex The way the TVindustrial complex works
is you buy some ads interrupt some people
that gets you distribution You use the distribution you get
to sell more products You take the profit
from that to buy more ads And it goes around and around and around the same way that the militaryindustrial
complex worked a long time ago That model of
and we heard it yesterday  if we could only get
onto the homepage of Google if we could only figure out
how to get promoted there or grab that person by the throat and tell them about what we want to do If we did that then everyone would pay
attention and we would win Well this TVindustrial complex informed
my entire childhood and probably yours I mean all of these products succeeded
because someone figured out how to touch people in a way
they werent expecting in a way they didnt
necessarily want with an ad over and over again until they bought it And the thing thats happened is
they canceled the TVindustrial complex That just over the last few years what anybody who markets
anything has discovered is that its not working
the way that it used to This picture is really fuzzy I apologize
I had a bad cold when I took it But the product in the blue box
in the center is my poster child I go to the deli Im sick
I need to buy some medicine The brand manager for that blue product
spent  million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year  million dollars interrupting me
with TV commercials and magazine ads and Spam and coupons and shelving
allowances and spiff  all so I could ignore
every single message And I ignored every message because I dont have
a pain reliever problem I buy the stuff in the yellow box
because I always have And Im not going to invest a minute
of my time to solve her problem because I dont care Heres a magazine called Hydrate
Its  pages about water Articles about water ads about water Imagine what the world
was like  years ago with just the Saturday Evening Post
and Time and Newsweek Now there are magazines about water New product from Coke Japan water salad Coke Japan comes out
with a new product every three weeks because they have no idea
whats going to work and whats not I couldnt have written
this better myself It came out four days ago  I circled the important parts
so you can see them here Theyve come out Arbys is going to spend
 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold hoping that that will get people to go
to Arbys and buy a roast beef sandwich Now I had tried to imagine what could
possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold
that would get you to get in your car drive across town
and buy a roast beef sandwich Now this is Copernicus and he was right when he was talking to anyone
who needs to hear your idea The world revolves around me Me me me me My favorite person  me I dont want to get email
from anybody I want to get memail So consumers and I dont just mean
people who buy stuff at the Safeway I mean people at the Defense Department
who might buy something or people at you know the New Yorker
who might print your article Consumers dont care about you
at all they just dont care Part of the reason is  theyve got
way more choices than they used to and way less time And in a world where we have
too many choices and too little time the obvious thing to do
is just ignore stuff And my parable here
is youre driving down the road and you see a cow and you keep driving
because youve seen cows before Cows are invisible Cows are boring Whos going to stop and pull over
and say  Oh look a cow Nobody But if the cow was purple 
isnt that a great special effect I could do that again if you want If the cow was purple
youd notice it for a while I mean if all cows were purple
youd get bored with those too The thing thats going to decide
what gets talked about what gets done what gets changed what gets purchased what gets built is Is it remarkable And remarkable is a really cool word because we think it just means neat but it also means
worth making a remark about And that is the essence
of where idea diffusion is going That two of the hottest cars
in the United States is a dollar giant car big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk People are paying full price for both and the only thing they have in common is that they dont have
anything in common Every week the number one
bestselling DVD in America changes Its never The Godfather
its never Citizen Kane its always some thirdrate movie
with some secondrate star But the reason its number one
is because thats the week it came out Because its new because its fresh People saw it and said
I didnt know that was there and they noticed it Two of the big success stories
of the last  years in retail  one sells things that are
superexpensive in a blue box and one sells things that are
as cheap as they can make them The only thing they have in common
is that theyre different Were now in the fashion business
no matter what we do for a living were in the fashion business And people in the fashion business know what its like to be in the fashion
business  theyre used to it The rest of us have to figure out
how to think that way How to understand that its not about interrupting
people with big fullpage ads or insisting on meetings with people But its a totally different
sort of process that determines which ideas spread
and which ones dont They sold a billion dollars
worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing
what it meant to sell a chair They turned a chair from something
the purchasing department bought to something that was a status symbol
about where you sat at work This guy Lionel Poilne
the most famous baker in the world  he died two and a half months ago and he was a hero of mine
and a dear friend He lived in Paris Last year he sold  million dollars
worth of French bread Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned by one baker at a time
in a woodfired oven And when Lionel started his bakery
the French poohpoohed it They didnt want to buy his bread It didnt look like French bread It wasnt what they expected It was neat it was remarkable and slowly it spread
from one person to another person until finally it became the official
bread of threestar restaurants in Paris Now hes in London and he ships
by FedEx all around the world What marketers used to do is make
average products for average people Thats what mass marketing is Smooth out the edges go for the center
thats the big market They would ignore the geeks
and God forbid the laggards It was all about going for the center But in a world where
the TVindustrial complex is broken I dont think thats a strategy
we want to use any more I think the strategy we want to use
is to not market to these people because theyre really good
at ignoring you But market to these
people because they care These are the people
who are obsessed with something And when you talk to them theyll listen because they like listening 
its about them And if youre lucky theyll tell
their friends on the rest of the curve and itll spread Itll spread to the entire curve They have something I call otaku 
its a great Japanese word It describes the desire
of someone whos obsessed to say drive across Tokyo to try
a new ramen noodle place because thats what they do
they get obsessed with it To make a product to market an idea to come up with any problem
you want to solve that doesnt have
a constituency with an otaku is almost impossible Instead you have to find
a group that really desperately cares about what it is you have to say Talk to them and make it easy
for them to tell their friends Theres a hot sauce otaku
but theres no mustard otaku Thats why theres lots and lots
of kinds of hot sauces and not so many kinds of mustard Not because its hard
to make interesting mustard  you could make interesting mustard  but people dont
because no ones obsessed with it and thus no one tells their friends Krispy Kreme has figured
this whole thing out It has a strategy and what they do is they enter a city they talk
to the people with the otaku and then they spread through the city to the people whove just
crossed the street This yoyo right here cost  dollars
but it sleeps for  minutes Not everybody wants it
but they dont care They want to talk to the people
who do and maybe itll spread These guys make the loudest
car stereo in the world Its as loud as a  jet You cant get in
the cars got bulletproof glass because itll blow out
the windshield otherwise But the fact remains that when someone wants to put
a couple of speakers in their car if theyve got the otaku
or theyve heard from someone who does they go ahead and they pick this Its really simple  you sell
to the people who are listening and just maybe
those people tell their friends So when Steve Jobs talks
to  people at his keynote who are all tuned in from  countries watching his twohour commercial  thats the only thing keeping
his company in business  its that those  people
care desperately enough to watch a twohour commercial
and then tell their friends Pearl Jam  albums released
in the last two years Every one made a profit How They only sell them on their website Those people who buy them have the otaku and then they tell their friends
and it spreads and it spreads This hospital crib cost  dollars
 times the standard But hospitals are buying it
faster than any other model Hard Candy nail polish
doesnt appeal to everybody but to the people who love it
they talk about it like crazy This paint can right here saved
the Dutch Boy paint company making them a fortune It costs  percent more
than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people
talk about because its remarkable They didnt just slap
a new ad on the product they changed what it meant
to build a paint product AmIhotornotcom  everyday
 people go to this site run by two volunteers and I can
tell you they are hard graders  They didnt get this way
by advertising a lot They got this way by being remarkable sometimes a little too remarkable And this picture frame
has a cord going out the back and you plug it into the wall My father has this on his desk and he sees his grandchildren
everyday changing constantly And every single person
who walks into his office hears the whole story
of how this thing ended up on his desk And one person at a time
the idea spreads These are not diamonds not really Theyre made from cremains After youre cremated you can
have yourself made into a gem Oh you like my ring Its my grandmother Fastestgrowing business
in the whole mortuary industry But you dont have to be Ozzie Osborne  you dont have to be
superoutrageous to do this What you have to do is figure out what people
really want and give it to them A couple of quick rules to wrap up The first one is Design
is free when you get to scale The people who come up
with stuff thats remarkable more often than not figure out
how to put design to work for them Number two The riskiest thing
you can do now is be safe Proctor and Gamble knows this right The whole model of being
Proctor and Gamble is always about average products
for average people Thats risky The safe thing to do now
is to be at the fringes be remarkable And being very good is one
of the worst things you can possibly do Very good is boring Very good is average It doesnt matter whether
youre making a record album or youre an architect
or you have a tract on sociology If its very good its not going to work
because no ones going to notice it So my three stories Silk put a product that does not need
to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk
in the refrigerated section Sales tripled Why Milk milk milk milk milk  not milk For the people who were there
and looking at that section it was remarkable They didnt triple their sales
with advertising they tripled it by doing
something remarkable That is a remarkable piece of art You dont have to like it but a foot tall dog made out of bushes
in the middle of New York City is remarkable Frank Gehry didnt just change a museum he changed an entire citys economy by designing one building that people
from all over the world went to see Now at countless meetings at you know the Portland City Council
or who knows where they said we need an architect 
can we get Frank Gehry Because he did something
that was at the fringes And my big failure
I came out with an entire  Music A record album and hopefully
a whole bunch of record albums in SACD this remarkable new format  and I marketed it straight to people
with dollar stereos People with dollar stereos
dont like new music So what you need to do
is figure out who does care Who is going to raise their hand and say I want to hear what youre doing next and sell something to them The last example I want to give you This is a map of Soap Lake Washington As you can see if thats nowhere
its in the middle of it But they do have a lake And people used to come from miles
around to swim in the lake They dont anymore So the founding fathers said
Weve got some money to spend What can we build here And like most committees they were going to build
something pretty safe And then an artist came to them 
this is a true artists rendering  he wants to build a foot tall
lava lamp in the center of town Thats a purple cow
thats something worth noticing I dont know about you but if they build it
thats where Im going to go Thank you very much for your attention ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
29,"Youll be happy to know that
Ill be talking not about my own tragedy but other peoples tragedy Its a lot easier to be lighthearted
about other peoples tragedy than your own and I want to keep it
in the spirit of the conference So if you believe the media accounts being a drug dealer in the height
of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life
in the words of Virginia Postrel There was money
there was drugs guns women you know you name it  jewelry
blingbling  it had it all What Im going to tell you today is that
in fact based on  years of research a unique opportunity
to go inside a gang  to see the actual books
the financial records of the gang  that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang
was a glamorous life But I think more realistically
that being in a gang  selling drugs for a gang  is perhaps
the worst job in all of America And thats what Id like
to convince you of today So there are three things I want to do First I want to explain
how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence
on innercity gangs Secondly I want to tell you how somebody like me
came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang 
an interesting story I think And then third I want to tell you
in a very superficial way about some of the things we found when we actually got to look
at the financial records the books of the gang So before I do that just one warning which is that this presentation
has been rated R by the Motion Picture
Association of America It contains adult themes adult language Given who is up on the stage
youll be delighted to know that in fact therell be no nudity  Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside So let me start by talking
about crack cocaine and how it transformed the gang To do that you have to actually go
back to a time before crack cocaine in the early s and look at it
from the perspective of a gang leader Being a gang leader in the inner city
wasnt such a bad deal in the mids  the early s let me say Now you had a lot of power
and you got to beat people up  you got a lot of prestige
a lot of respect But the thing is
there was no money in it The gang had no way to make money You couldnt charge dues
to the people in the gang because the people in the gang
didnt have any money You couldnt really make any money
selling marijuana  marijuanas too cheap it turns out You cant get rich selling marijuana You couldnt sell cocaine cocaines a great product 
powdered cocaine  but youve got to know rich white people And most of the innercity gang members
didnt know any rich white people so couldnt sell to that market You couldnt really do
petty crime either Turns out petty crimes
a terrible way to make a living As a result as a gang leader
you had you know power  its a pretty good life 
but the thing was in the end you were living at home with your mother And so it wasnt really a career There were limits to how powerful
and important you could be if you had to live at home
with your mother Then along comes crack cocaine And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell crack cocaine was the extrachunky
version of tomato sauce for the inner city Because crack cocaine
was an unbelievable innovation I dont have time to talk about it today
but if you think about it I would say that in the last  years of every invention or innovation
thats occurred in this country the biggest one in terms of impact on the wellbeing of people
who live in the inner city was crack cocaine And for the worse 
not for the better but for the worse It had a huge impact on life So what was it about crack cocaine It was a brilliant way
of getting the brain high Because you could smoke crack cocaine 
you cant smoke powdered cocaine  and smoking is a much more efficient
mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it And it turned out there was this audience
that didnt know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did And it was a perfect drug you could buy the cocaine
that went into it for a dollar sell it for five dollars Highly addictive 
the high was very short So for fifteen minutes
you get this great high and then when you come down all you want to do is get high again It created a wonderful market And for the people who were there
running the gang it was a great way seemingly
to make a lot of money At least for the people on the top So this is where we enter the picture Not really me  Im really
a bit player in all this My coauthor Sudhir Venkatesh
is the main character He was a math major in college
who had a good heart and decided he wanted
to get a sociology PhD came to the University of Chicago Now the three months
before he came to Chicago he had spent following the Grateful Dead And in his own words
he looked like a freak Hes a South Asian 
very darkskinned South Asian Big man and he had hair
in his words down to his ass Defied all kinds of boundaries Was he black or white
Was he man or woman He was really a curious sight to be seen So he showed up
at the University of Chicago and the famous sociologist
William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved
surveying people all across Chicago He took one look at Sudhir who was going
to go do some surveys for him and decided he knew exactly
the place to send him which was to one of the toughest
most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago
but in the entire United States So Sudhir the suburban boy who had never
really been in the inner city dutifully took his clipboard
and walked down to this housing project gets to the first building The first building
Well theres nobody there But he hears some voices
up in the stairwell so he climbs up the stairwell
comes around the corner and finds a group of young
AfricanAmerican men playing dice This is about 
peak of the crack epidemic This is a very dangerous job
being in a gang You dont like to be surprised You dont like to be surprised
by people who come around the corner And the mantra was
shoot first ask questions later Now Sudhir was lucky 
he was such a freak and that clipboard
probably saved his life because they figured no other
rival gang member would be coming up to shoot
at them with a clipboard So his greeting was not particularly
warm but they did say well OK  lets hear
your questions on your survey So  I kid you not  the first question on the survey
that he was sent to ask was How do you feel about being
poor and Black in America Makes you wonder about academics So the choice of answers were A Very Good B Good C Bad D Very Bad What Sudhir found out is in fact
that the real answer was the following A Very Good B Good C Bad
D Very Bad E Fuck you The survey was not in the end going
to be what got Sudhir off the hook He was held hostage
overnight in the stairwell There was a lot of gunfire there were a lot of philosophical
discussions he had with the gang members By morning the gang leader arrived checked out Sudhir
decided he was no threat and they let him go home So Sudhir went home
took a shower took a nap And you and I probably faced
with the situation would think I guess Im going to write
my dissertation on The Grateful Dead Ive been following them
for the last three months Sudhir on the other hand got right back walked
down to the housing project went up to the second floor and said Hey guys I had so much fun
hanging out with you last night I wonder if I could do it again tonight And that was the beginning of what turned
out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing
project on and off for  years hanging out in crack houses
going to jail with the gang members having the windows shot out of his car having the police break into his apartment
and steal his computer disks  you name it But ultimately the story
has a happy ending for Sudhir who became one of the most
respected sociologists in the country And especially for me as I sat in my office
with my Excel spreadsheet open waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver
to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang It was one of the most unequal
coauthoring relationships ever  But I was glad to be
the beneficiary of it So what did we find What did we find in the gang Well let me say one thing We really got access
to everybody in the gang We got an inside look at the gang
from the very bottom up to the very top They trusted Sudhir in ways
that really no academic has ever  or really anybody any outsider 
has ever earned the trust of these gangs to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting
for me  their books the financial records they kept They made them available to us
and we not only could study them but we could ask them questions
about what was in them So if I have to kind of summarize
very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what
I take away from the gang is its that if I had to draw
a parallel between the gang and any other organization it would be that the gang
is just like McDonalds in a lot of different respects 
the restaurant McDonalds So first in one way which isnt maybe the most interesting
way but its a good way to start  is in the way its organized
the hierarchy of the gang the way it looks So heres what the org chart
of the gang looks like I dont know if you know much
about org charts but if you were to assign a strippeddown
and simplified McDonalds org chart this is exactly what it would look like Its amazing but the top
level of the gang they actually call themselves
the Board of Directors And Sudhir says its not like these guys
had a very sophisticated view of what happened
in American corporate life but they had seen movies
like Wall Street and they had learned a little bit
about what it was like to be in the real world Now below that board of directors youve got essentially
what are regional VPs  people who control say the South Side
of Chicago or the West Side of Chicago Sudhir got to know very well the guy
who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant
financial endeavors they undertook But the thing that really makes the gang
seem like McDonalds is its franchisees The guys who are running
the local gangs  the foursquareblock
by foursquareblock areas  theyre just like the guys in some sense
who are running the McDonalds They are the entrepreneurs They get the exclusive property rights
to control the drugselling They get the name of the gang behind them
for merchandising and marketing And theyre the ones who basically
make the profit or lose a profit depending on how good
they are at running the business Now the group I really want you
to think about though are the ones at the bottom 
the foot soldiers These are the teenagers typically whod be standing out on the street
corner selling the drugs Extremely dangerous work And important to note is that almost all
of the weight all of the people in this organization are at the bottom 
just like McDonalds So in some sense the foot soldiers
are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonalds and its not just by chance
that theyre like them In fact in these neighborhoods
theyd be the same people So the same kids who are working
in the gang were actually at the very same time
typically working parttime at a place like McDonalds Which already foreshadows
the main result that Ive talked about about what a crappy job
it was being in the gang Because obviously if being in the gang
were such a wonderful lucrative job why in the world would these guys
moonlight at McDonalds So what do the wages look like
You might be surprised But based on being able to talk to them
and to see their records this is what it looks
like in terms of the wages The hourly wage the foot soldiers
were earning was  an hour It was below the minimum wage
And this is welldocumented Its easy to see by the patterns
of consumption they have It really is not fiction  its fact There was very little money in the gang
especially at the bottom Now if you managed to rise up say
and be that local leader the guy whos the equivalent
of the McDonalds franchisee youd be making  dollars a year And that in some ways
was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these
neighborhoods as a young black male If you managed to rise to the very top  or  dollars a year
is what youd hope to make Truly you would be a great success story And one of the sad parts
of this is that indeed among the many other
ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals
in these communities  this is what they were striving for They werent trying to make it
in legitimate ways because there were
no legitimate channels out This was the best way out And it actually was
the right choice probably to try to make it out this way You look at this the relationship to McDonalds
breaks down here The money looks about the same Why is it such a bad job Well the reason its such a bad job
is that theres somebody shooting at you a lot of the time So with shooting at you
what are the death rates We found in our gang  and admittedly this was not really
a standard situation this was a time of intense violence
of a lot of gang wars as this gang actually
became quite successful But there were costs And so the death rate  not to mention the rate of being arrested
sent to prison being wounded  the death rate in our sample
was seven percent per person per year Youre in the gang for four years you expect to die
with about a  percent likelihood That is about as high as you can get So for comparisons purposes lets think about some other walk of life
you may expect might be extremely risky Lets say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder
and youre sent to death row It turns out the death rates on death row
from all causes including execution two percent a year So its a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs
out on the street That gives you some pause
for those of you who believe that a death penaltys going to have
an enormous deterrent effect on crime To give you a sense of just how bad
the inner city was during crack  and Im not really focusing
on the negatives but really theres another story
to tell you there  if you look at the death rates
just of random young black males growing up in the inner city
in the United States the death rates during crack
were about one percent Thats extremely high And this is violent death 
its unbelievable in some sense To put it into perspective if you compare
this to the soldiers in Iraq for instance right now
fighting the war  percent So in some very literal way the young black men who were
growing up in this country were living in a war zone very much in the sense that the soldiers
over in Iraq are fighting in a war So why in the world you might ask would anybody be willing
to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for  an hour with a  percent chance of dying
over the next four years Why would they do that And I think there are a couple answers I think the first one
is that they got fooled by history It used to be the gang
was a rite of passage that the young people controlled the gang that as you got older
you dropped out of the gang So what happened was the people who happened to be
in the right place at the right time  the people who happened to be leading
the gang in the midtolates  became very very wealthy And so the logical thing to think was that they are going
to age out of the gang like everybody else has and the next generation is going
to take over and get the wealth There are striking similarities
I think to the Internet boom The first set of people in Silicon Valley
got very very rich And then all of my friends said
Maybe I should go do that too And they were willing to work very cheap
for stock options that never came In some sense
thats what happened exactly to the set of people we were looking at They were willing to start at the bottom just like say a firstyear
lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom work hour weeks
for not that much money because they think
theyre going to make partner But the rules changed
and they never got to make partner Indeed the same people who were running
all of the major gangs in the late s are still running the major gangs
in Chicago today They never passed on any of the wealth So everybody got stuck
at that anhour job and it turned out to be a disaster The other thing the gang was
very good at was marketing and trickery And so for instance
one thing the gang would do is  the gang leaders would have
big entourages and theyd drive fancy cars
and have fancy jewelry So what Sudhir eventually realized
as he hung out with them more is that really they didnt own
those cars  they just leased them because they couldnt afford
to own the fancy cars And they didnt really have gold jewelry
they had goldplated jewelry It goes back to you know
the realreal versus the fakereal And really they did all sorts
of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal
the gang was going to be So for instance they would give
a yearold kid a whole roll of bills to hold That yearold kid
would say to his friends Hey look at all the money
I got in the gang It wasnt his money  until he spent it and then he was in debt to the gang and was sort of an indentured
servant for a while So I have a couple minutes Let me do one last thing
I hadnt thought Id have time to do which is to talk about what we learned
more generally about economics from the study of the gang So economists tend to talk
in technical words Often our theories fail quite miserably
when we over the data but whats kind of interesting
is that in this setting it turned out that
some of the economic theories that worked not so well
in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy in some sense because
its unfettered capitalism Heres an economic principle This is one of the basic ideas
in labor economics called a compensating differential Its the idea that the increment to wages
that a worker requires to leave him indifferent
between performing two tasks one which is more unpleasant
than the other Compensating differential  its why
we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks The words of one of the members
of the gang I think make this clear So it turns out  Im sort
of getting ahead of myself  it turns out in the gang
when theres a war going on they actually pay the foot soldiers
twice as much money Its exactly this concept Because theyre not willing to be at risk And the words of a gang member
capture it quite nicely he says Would you stand around here when all
this shit   the shooting   if all this shits
going on No right So if I gonna be asked to put my life
on the line then front me the cash man I think the gang member says it
much more articulately than the economist about whats going on Heres another one Economists talk about game theory that every twoperson game
has a Nash equilibrium Heres the translation
you get from the gang member Theyre talking about the decision
of why they dont go shoot  One thing that turns out to be a great
business tactic in the gang if you go and just shoot guns in the air
in the other gangs territory  people are afraid to go buy drugs there theyre going to come
into your neighborhood Heres what he says
about why they dont do that If we start shooting around there
the other gangs territory nobody I mean you dig it
nobody gonna step on their turf But we gotta be careful cause they can shoot around here too
and then we all fucked So thats the same concept Then again sometimes
economists get it wrong One thing we observed in the data
is that it looked like  the gang leader always got paid No matter how bad it was economically
he always got himself paid We had some theories related to cash flow and lack of access to capital markets
and things like that Then we asked the gang member Why is it you always get paid
and your workers dont always get paid His response is You got all these niggers below you
who want your job you dig If you start taking losses
they see you as weak and shit And I thought about it and said CEOs often pay themselves
milliondollar bonuses even when companies
are losing a lot of money And it never would really occur
to an economist that this idea of weak and shit
could really be important Maybe weak and shit is an important
hypothesis that needs more analysis Thank you very much ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
30,Once upon a time there was a dread disease that afflicted children And in fact among all the diseases that existed in this land it was the worst It killed the most children And along came a brilliant inventor a scientist who came up with a partial cure for that disease And it wasnt perfect Many children still died but it was certainly better than what they had before And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free virtually free and was very easy to use But the worst thing about it was that you couldnt use it on the youngest children on infants and on oneyearolds And so as a consequence a few years later another scientist  perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him but building on the invention of the first one  came up with a second cure And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and oneyearolds And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive and it was very complicated to use And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end But what they did of course since it was so complicated and expensive they only used it on the zeroyearolds and the oneyearolds And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the twoyearolds and up And this went on for quite some time People were happy They had their two cures Until a particular mother whose child had just turned two died of this disease And she thought to herself My child just turned two and until the child turned two I had always used this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment And then the child turned two and I started using the cheap and easy treatment and I wonder  and she wondered like all parents who lose children wonder  if there isnt something that I could have done like keep on using that complicated expensive cure And she told all the other people and she said How could it possibly be that something thats cheap and simple works as well as something thats complicated and expensive And the people thought You know youre right It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution And the government they heard her story and the other people and they said Yeah youre right we should make a law We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children And the people were happy They were satisfied For many years this went along and everything was fine But then along came a lowly economist who had children himself and he used the expensive and complicated treatment But he knew about the cheap and simple one And he thought about it and the expensive one didnt seem that great to him So he thought I dont know anything about science but I do know something about data so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one And lo and behold when he went through the data he found that it didnt look like the expensive complicated solution was any better than the cheap one at least for the children who were two and older  the cheap one still didnt work on the kids who were younger And so he went forth to the people and he said Ive made this wonderful finding it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution and by doing so we could save ourselves  million dollars a year and we could spend that on our children in other ways And the parents were very unhappy and they said This is a terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing And the government was very upset And in particular the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought How can we hope to compete with something thats essentially free We would lose all of our market And people were very angry and they called him horrible names And he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days and seek out some more intelligent openminded people in a place called Oxford and come and try and tell the story at that place And so anyway here I am Its not a fairy tale Its a true story about the United States today and the disease Im referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children And the free cure is adult seatbelts and the expensive cure  the milliondollarayear cure  is child car seats And what Id like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true that for children two years old and up there really is no real benefit  proven benefit  of car seats in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts And then talk about why  what is it that makes that true And then finally talk a little bit about a third way about another technology which is probably better than anything we have but which  there hasnt been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution OK So many times when you try to do research on data it records complicated stories  its hard to find in the data It doesnt turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident thats happened since  So in every car crash in which at least one person dies they have information on all of the people So if you look at that data  its right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administrations website  you can just look at the raw data and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence thats in favor of car seats for children aged two and up So here is the data Here I have among two to sixyearolds  anyone above six basically no one uses car seats so you cant compare   percent of the children who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies themselves die If you put a child in a car seat  percent of the children die If theyre wearing a lapandshoulder belt in this raw data  percent die And interestingly wearing a laponly seatbelt  percent die And actually the theory tells you that the laponly seatbelts got to be worse than the lapandshoulder belt And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way So what we do in the study is  and this is just presenting the same information but turned into a figure to make it easier So the yellow bar represents car seats the orange bar lapandshoulder and the red bar laponly seatbelts And this is all relative to unrestrained  the bigger the bar the better Okay So this is the data I just showed OK So the highest bar is what youre striving to beat So you can control for the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting in etc the age of the child And thats that middle set of bars And so you can see that the laponly seatbelts start to look worse once you do that And then finally the last set of bars which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash    different characteristics of the crash And what you find is that the car seats and the lapandshoulder belts when it comes to saving lives fatalities look exactly identical And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well And its not just overall Its very robust to anything you want to look at One thing thats interesting if you look at frontalimpact crashes  when the car crashes the front hits into something  indeed what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better And I think this isnt just chance In order to have the car seat approved you need to pass certain federal standards all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash But when you look at other types of crashes like rearimpact crashes indeed the car seats dont perform as well And I think thats because theyve been optimized to pass as we always expect people to do to optimize relative to brightline rules about how affected the car will be And the other thing you might argue is Well car seats have got a lot better over time And so if we look at recent crashes  the whole data set is almost  years worth of data  you wont see it in the recent crashes The new car seats are far far better But indeed in recent crashes the lapandshoulder seatbelts actually are doing even better than the car seats They say Well thats impossible that cant be And the line of argument if you ask parents is But car seats are so expensive and complicated and they have this big tangle of latches how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated Its kind of an interesting logic I think that people use And the other logic they say Well the government wouldnt have told us to use them if they werent much better But whats interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two which has led to the passage of all these laws  not very much on data So you can only get so far I think in telling your story by using these abstract statistics And so I had some friends over to dinner and I was asking  we had a cookout  I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point They said Why dont you run some crash tests And I said Thats a great idea So we actually tried to commission some crash tests And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said some explicitly some not so explicitly All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers We cant risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats Now eventually one did Under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do this test for us  so anonymity and  dollars per seat that we crashed And so we went to Buffalo New York and here is the precursor to it These are the crash test dummies waiting for their chance to take the center stage And then heres how the crash test works Here they dont actually crash the entire car you know  its not worth ruining a whole car to do it So they just have these bench seats and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it So I just wanted you to look at this And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great Look at the kid in the car seat Does he not look content ready to go like he could survive anything And then if you look at the kid in back it looks like hes already choking before the crash even happens Its hard to believe when you look at this that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash So this is going to be a crash where theyre going to slam this thing forward into a wall at  miles an hour and see what happens OK So let me show you what happens These are threeyearold dummies by the way So here  this is the car seat Now watch two things watch how the head goes forward and basically hits the knees  and this is in the car seat  and watch how the car seat flies around in the rebound up in the air The car seats moving all over the place Bear in mind there are two things about this This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed  car seats who knew exactly how to do it And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them And so this is a test thats very much rigged in favor of the car seat OK So that kid in this crash fared very well The federal standards are that you have to score below a  to be an approved car seat on this crash in some metric of units which are not important And this crash would have been about a  So this car seat was actually an aboveaverage car seat from Consumer Reports and did quite well So the next one Now this is the kid same crash who is in the seatbelt He hardly moves at all actually relative to the other child The funny thing is the cam work is terrible because theyve only set it up to do the car seats and so they actually dont even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid thats on the rebound Anyway it turns out that those two crashes that actually the threeyearold did slightly worse So he gets about a  out of  you know on this range  relative to a  and something But still if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government and said I have invented a new car seat I would like you to approve it for selling then they would say This is a fantastic new car seat it works great It only got a  it could have gotten as high up as a  And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat So in some sense what this is suggesting is that its not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong which is putting children at risk Its just that fundamentally the car seats arent doing much So heres the crash So these are timed at the same time so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat  at rebound it takes a lot longer  but theres just a lot less movement for child whos in the seatbelt So Ill show you the sixyearold crashes as well The sixyearold is in a car seat and it turns out that looks terrible but thats great Thats like a  OK So that kid would do fine in the crash Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all And then heres the sixyearold in the seatbelt and in fact they get exactly within you know within one or two points of the same So really for the sixyearold the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever Thats some more evidence so in some sense  I was criticized by a scientist who said You could never publish a study with an n of  meaning those four crashes So I wrote him back and I said What about an n of  Because I had the other  other realworld crashes And I just think that its interesting that the idea of using realworld crashes which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do is something that scientists dont actually usually think  they would rather use a laboratory a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies than actually  years of data of what weve seen with children and with car seats And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that theres a much better solution out there thats gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working And if you think from a design perspective about going back to square one and say I just want to protect kids in the back seat I dont theres anyone in this room whod say Well the right way to start would be lets make a great seat belt for adults And then lets make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain I mean why not start  whos sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids But essentially do something like this which I dont know exactly how much it would cost to do but theres no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat Its just actually  you see this is folding up  its behind the seat Youve got a regular seat for adults and then you fold it down and the kid sits on top and its integrated It seems to me that this cant be a very expensive solution and its got to work better than what we already have So the question is is there any hope for adoption of something like this which would presumably save a lot of lives And I think the answer perhaps lies in a story The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful and why this may someday be adopted or not lies in a story that my dad told me relating to when he was a doctor in the US Air Force in England And this is a long time ago you were allowed to do things then you cant do today So my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them and hed say Come back in a week if you still feel lousy OK and most of them would not come back but some of them would come back And when they came back he still convinced they were not sick had another jar of pills In this jar were huge horse pills They were almost impossible to swallow And these to me are the analogy for the car seats People would look at these and say Man this thing is so big and so hard to swallow If this doesnt make me feel better you know what possibly could And it turned out that most people wouldnt come back because it worked But every once in a while there was still a patient convinced that he was sick and hed come back And my dad had a third jar of pills And the jar of pills he had he said were the tiniest little pills he could find so small you could barely see them And he would say listen I know I gave you that huge pill that complicated hardtoswallow pill before but now Ive got one thats so potent that is really tiny and small and almost invisible Its almost like this thing here which you cant even see And it turned out that never in all the times my dad gave out this pill the really tiny pill did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness So my dad always took that as evidence that this little teeny powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect And in some sense if thats the right story I think integrated car seats you will see very quickly becoming something that everyone has The other possible conclusion is well maybe after coming to my father three times getting sent home with placebos he still felt sick he went and found another doctor And thats completely possible And if thats the case then I think were stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come Thank you very much Audience I just wanted to ask you when we wear seatbelts we dont necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life its also to prevent lots of serious injury Your data looks at fatalities It doesnt look at serious injury Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury Because that would prove your case Steven Levitt Yeah thats a great question In my data and in another data set Ive looked at for New Jersey crashes I find very small differences in injury So in this data its statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lapandshoulder belts In the New Jersey data which is different because its not just fatal crashes but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported it turns out that there is a  percent difference in injuries but generally theyre the minor injuries Now whats interesting I should say this as a disclaimer there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data which suggests that car seats are dramatically better And they use a completely different methodology that involves  after the crash occurs they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash and they call them on the phone and they asked them what happened And I really cant resolve yet and Id like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences which are completely at odds with one another But its obviously a critical question The question is even if  are there enough serious injuries to make these costeffective Its kind of tricky Even if theyre right its not so clear that theyre so costeffective ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
31,I dont know your name Audience Member Howard Howard Thom Mayne Howard Im sitting next to Howard I dont know Howard obviously and hes going I hope youre not next Amazing Amazing performance I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that Let me start some place Im interested  I kind of do the same thing but I dont move my body Laughter And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space I work in the mineral world I work with more or less inert matter And I organize it And well its also a bit different because an architect versus lets say a dance company finally is a negotiation between ones private world ones conceptual world the world of ideas the world of aspirations of inventions with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations the naysayers Because I have to say for my whole career if theres anything thats been consistent its been that you cant do it No matter what Ive done what Ive tried to do everybody says it cant be done And its continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas And to be an architect somehow you have to negotiate between left and right and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world and then make it understood I can start any number of places because this process is also  I think  very different from some of the morning sessions which you had such a kind of very clear such a lineal idea like the last one say with Howard that I think the creative process in architecture the design process is extremely circuitous Its labyrinthine Its Calvinos idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line not the straight line And definitely my life has been part of that Im going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things But basically what we do is we try to give coherence to the world We make physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process they make cities And those things are the reflection of the processes and the time that they are made And what Im doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material Because really all Im interested in always as an architect is the way things are produced because thats what I do Right And its not based on an a priori notion I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying This is what it looks like In fact somebody mentioned  Ewan maybe it was you in your introduction  about this is what architects  did somebody say its what business people come to its what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line Huh Wow It doesnt work that way for me at all I have no interest in that whatsoever Architecture is the beginning of something because its  if youre not involved in first principles if youre not involved in the absolute the beginning of that generative process its cake decoration And Ive nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators if anybodys involved in cake decorations  its not what Im interested in doing Laughter And so in the formation of things in giving it form in concretizing these things it starts with some notion of how one organizes And Ive had for  years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear and to understand the nature of the final result of that representing the building itself Theres been a continual relationship between inventions which are private and reality which has been important to me A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen  years ago which was the modeling of a hippocampus  the territory of the brain that records shortterm memory  and the documentation of that the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer observing every kilometer a particular object of desire and then placing that within this And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies but built on nonsequiturs built on randomness And Id been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city an accretional notion of the city and that led to various ideas of organization And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems And its not any single system that makes the work Its the relationship  its the dynamics between the systems  which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is  that would otherwise not exist And those systems could be identified and they could be grouped together And of course today with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping etc we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because thats all we do Were producing spaces that accommodate human activity And what Im interested in is not the styling of that but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity And that directly connects to ideas of citymaking This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very very large city project that came directly out of this process which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it And the project  again enormous enormous competition  on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago which uses these processes And what youre looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces that deals with the enormity of the problem the complexity of the problem when were designing cities at larger and larger aggregates Because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems And that led us directly to the Olympic Village I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC We won the competition  what was it nine months ago Again a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated very largescale organisms And then also was working with broad strategies In this case we only used  of the  acres of land and the  acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs etc Its position of course in the middle of Manhattan  its on Hunters Point And then the broader ideas of citymaking start having direct influences on architecture on the elements that make up the broader scheme the buildings themselves and start guiding us Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place And so I can start this discussion in any number of places and Ive chosen three or four to talk about And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base Theres just no place that it doesnt somehow have a connective tissue to This is Jim Dine and its the absence of presence etc Its the clothing the skin without the presence of the character It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very kind of complex space And the idea was the relationship of the space which was made up of the fold of the image and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space which were in dialog And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations And this was the first prototype in Korea as were dealing with a dynamic envelope and then the same characteristic of the fabric It has a material identity and its translucent and its porous and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is And that turned right away into another project This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles And now were seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated Again its a very very simple notion If you look at most buildings what you look at is the building the facade and it is the building And all of a sudden were kind of moving away and were separating the skin from the body and thats going to lead to broader performance criteria which Im going to talk about in a minute And youre looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body And then again the building itself middle of Los Angeles right across from City Hall And as it moves it takes pieces of the earth with it It bends up Its part of a sign system which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles  the twodimension threedimension signing etc And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself Its transparent and it allows you to understand I think what is always the most interesting thing in any building which is the actual constructional processes that make it And its probably the most intense kind of territory of the work which is not occupied because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when its separated from function and this is an area that allows for that And then the skin starts transforming into other materials Were using light as a building material in this case Were working with Keith Sonnier in New York and were making this large outside room which is possible in Los Angeles and which is very much reflective of the urban the contemporary urban environments that you would find in Shibuya or youd find in Mexico City or Sao Paulo etc that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles And again all of it promoting transparency And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material Well that immediately turned into something much broader and as a scope And again were looking at an early sketch where Im understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction And now it turned into something much much broader as a problem and it has to do with performance This will be the first building in the United States that took  well I cant say it took the air conditioning out Its a hybrid I wanted a pure thing and I cant get it Its a wrong attitude actually because the hybrid is probably more interesting But we took the air conditioning out of the tower Theres some air conditioning left in the base but the skin now moves on hydraulics It forces air through a Venturi force if theres no wind It adjusts continually And we removed the air conditioning Huge huge thing Half a million dollars a year delta  of these  its just under a million square feet   and some thousand square feet   of these would power Sausalito  the delta on this And so now what were looking at as the projects get larger in scale as they interface with broader problems that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance Well I could also start here We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground Well our research  my generation for sure people who were going to school in the late s  made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture looking at architecture within its own territory and we were much more affected by film by what was going on in the art world etc This is of course Michael Heizer And when I saw this first an image and then visited it completely changed the way I thought after that point And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earths surface and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense And then  well he was probably looking at this  this is Nazca this is  years ago  the most amazing fourkilometer land sculptures Theyre just totally incredible And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw how we work This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona  well whatever it is a model a conceptual kind of idea And its the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable So it puts  square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work And there it is again as its starting to get resolved tectonically and then theres the school And of course were interested in participating with education I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X Y and Z function What Im interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because its a system thats developed not sculpturally Its an idea that started from my first discussion It has to do with a broad consistent logic and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building And theres an overt  at least theres an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem as one would understand that And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas It uses landscape as a major idea Then again were doing the headquarters for NOAA  National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency  outside of Washington in Maryland And this is how they see the world They have  satellites zipping around at plus or minus  miles and the sites in red And what we really want to do  well the architects if there are architects out there this is the Laugier Hut this is the primitive hut thats been around for so long  and what we wanted to do is really build this because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world and we wanted them to look down at their satellite how they see their own site that eightacre site and we wanted nothing left We wanted it to stay green Theres actually three baseball fields on it right now and theyre going to stay there We put one piece directly northsouth and it holds the dishes at the ears right And then right below that the processing and the mission lift and the mission control room and all the other spaces are underground And what you look at is an aircraft carrier thats performancedriven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion broken up by a series of courts and its five acres of uninterrupted horizontal space for their administrative offices And then that in turn propelled us to look at largerscale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue The new capital competition for Berlin four years ago And again we just finished the ECB  actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park which is parallel to the river and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric  the social cultural and the landscape recreational fabric of the city And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing but something thats only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time And a project that was realized in Austria the Hooper Bank which again used this idea of connecting typology the traditional buildings and morphology or the relationship of the development of land as an idea into a complex which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting this movement of the land thats a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it and other parts are much more energetic and intense And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together and then where part of it is in the ground part of it is oppositional lifts One enters the building as it lifts off the ground and it becomes part of the idea And then the skin  the edges of this  all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts geologic shifts Right And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior and those interiors again are promoting transparency for the workplace which has been a continual interest of ours And then again in a more kind of traditional setting this is a graduate student housing in Toronto and its very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city The main idea was the gateway where it breaks the site and the building occupies both the public space and the private space And its that territory of  its this thing I visited the site many times and everybody kind of  you can see this from two kilometers away its an exact center of the street and the whole notion is to engage the public to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city And finally one of the most interesting projects  its a courthouse And what I want to talk about  this is the Supreme Court of course  and well Im dealing with Michael Hogan the Chief Justice of Oregon You could not proceed without making this negotiation between ones own values and the relationship of the character youre working with and how he understands the court because Im showing him of course Corbusier at Savoy which is  which is the beginning of modern architecture Well then we get to this image And this is where the project started Because Im going Im interested in the phenomenon thats taking place in here And really what were talking about is constructing reality And Im a character thats extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because theres no such thing as nature any more Nature is gone Nature in the thcentury sense alright Nature is only a cultural edifice today right We construct it and we construct those ideas And then of course this one our governor at the moment And we spent some time with Conan believe it or not and then that led us to kind of the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic architectural And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work and the dynamics of that and what other sources of the work is And it led us to the project the courthouse which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse Youll find a stair thats the same length as the Supreme Court Heres a piano nobile which is a device used in the Renaissance The courts were made of that The skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution which were part of the little process all set on a plinth that defined it from the community Thank you so much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
32,I was asked to come here and speak about creation And I only have  minutes and I see theyre counting already And I can  in  minutes I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation which I call creativity Creativity is how we cope with creation While creation sometimes seems a bit ungraspable or even pointless creativity is always meaningful See for instance in this picture You know creation is what put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters When you think about  you know creativity has a lot to do with causality too You know when I was a teenager I was a creator I just did things Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was and tried to maintain that persona  I became creative It wasnt until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition that I could track exactly  looks like all the craziest things that I had done all my drinking all my parties  they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually Im talking to you at this moment Though its actually true you know the reason Im talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil If I was born in Monterey probably would be in Brazil You know I was born in Brazil and grew up in the s under a climate of political distress and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way  in a sort of a semiotic black market You couldnt really say what you wanted to say you had to invent ways of doing it You didnt trust information very much That led me to another step of why Im here today is because I really liked media of all kinds I was a media junkie and eventually got involved with advertising My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards and based on speed angle of approach and actually blocks of text It was very  actually it was a very good study and got me a job in an ad agency And they also decided that I had to  to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it And another point  why Im here  is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life picked the thing  didnt have any friends On my way out I had to break a fight apart Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles They were in tuxedos and fighting It was very ugly And also  advertising people do that all the time  Laughter  and I  well what happened is when I went back it was on the way back to my car the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun  I dont know why he had a gun  and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor The first person was wearing a black tie a tuxedo It was me Luckily it wasnt fatal as you can all see And even more luckily the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money otherwise I press charges And thats how  with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in  and thats very  the basic reason Im talking to you here today because I got shot Laughter Applause Well when I started working with my own work I decided that I shouldnt do images You know I became  I took this very iconoclastic approach Because when I decided to go into advertising I wanted to do  I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice for whiskey commercials thats what I really wanted to do Laughter But I  they didnt let me do it so I just  you know they would only let me do other things But I wasnt into selling whiskey I was into selling ice The first works were actually objects It was kind of a mixture of found object product design and advertising And I called them relics They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in  This is the clown skull Is a remnant of a race of  a very evolved race of entertainers They lived in Brazil long time ago Laughter This is the Ashanti joystick Unfortunately it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform A Playstation II is in the works maybe for the next TED Ill bring it The rocking podium Laughter This is the preColumbian coffeemaker Laughter Actually the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks that I insisted that I wasnt having Colombian coffee the coffee was actually preColumbian The Bonsai table The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume for travel purposes And the half tombstone for people who are not dead yet I wanted to take that into the realm of images and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts So I decided to do work with clouds Because clouds can mean anything you want But now I wanted to work in a very lowtech way so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton a cloud and Durers praying hands  although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouses praying hands But I was still you know  this is a kitty cloud Theyre called Equivalents after Alfred Stieglitzs work The Snail But I was still working with sculpture and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter The Teapot I had a chance to go to Florence in  I think it was  and I saw Ghibertis Door of Paradise And he did something that was very tricky He put together two different media from different periods of time First he got an ageold way of making it which was relief and he worked this with threepoint perspective which was brandnew technology at the time And its totally overkill And your eye doesnt know which level to read And you become trapped into this kind of representation So I decided to make these very simple renderings that at first they are taken as a line drawing  you know something thats very  and then I did it with wire The idea was to  because everybody overlooks white  like pencil drawings you know And they would look at it  Ah its a pencil drawing Then you have this double take and see that its actually something that existed in time It had a physicality and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way towards the image So this is Monkey with Leica Relaxation Fiat Lux And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings And I wanted to deal with other subjects I started taking that into the realm of landscape which is something thats almost a picture of nothing I made these pictures called Pictures of Thread and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture These always end up being a photograph at the end or more like an etching in this case So this is a lighthouse This is  Yards after Corot  Yards after Gerhard Richter And I dont know how many yards after John Constable Departing from the lines I decided to tackle the idea of points like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts and I did work and play with them I got some photographs from them Upon my arrival in New York I decided  they were children of sugar plantation workers And by manipulating sugar over a black paper I made portraits of them These are  Applause  Thank you This is Valentina the Fastest It was just the name of the child with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly Valicia Jacynthe But another layer of representation was still introduced Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject  something that would interfere with the themes so chocolate is very good because it has  it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance And so I decided to make these pictures and they were very large so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them So theyre called Pictures of Chocolate Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I He was the first subject And Jackson Pollock also Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting because you know you go to that  you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily like a face goes into becoming just a texture Paparazzi I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection And I picked minimalist pieces because theyre about specificity And you render this with the most nonspecific material which is dust itself Like you know you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor They do a DNA scan of this they will come up with a great mailing list This is Richard Serra I bought a computer and they told me it had millions of colors in it You know an artists first response to this is who counted it You know And I realized that I never worked with color because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors But once theyre applied to numeric structure then you can feel more comfortable So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches They end up being very large pictures and I photographed with a very large camera  an x camera So you can see the surface of every single swatch  like in this picture of Chuck Close And you have to walk very far to be able to see it Also the reference to Gerhard Richters use of color charts  and the idea also entering another realm of representation thats very common to us today which is the bit map I ended up narrowing the subject to Monets Haystacks This is something I used to do as a joke  you know make  the same like  Robert Smithsons Spiral Jetty  and then leaving traces as if it was done on a tabletop I tried to prove that he didnt do that thing in the Salt Lake But then just doing the models I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself I opt for very simple line drawings  kind of stupid looking And at the same time I was doing these very large constructions being  meters away Now I would do very small ones which would be like  but under the same light and I would show them together so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking I wasnt interested in the very large things or in the small things I was more interested in the things in between you know because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there This is like you see  the size of a person over there This is a pipe A hanger And this is another thing that I did  you know working  everybody loves to watch somebody draw but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in  a lot of people at the same time to evidence a single drawing And I love this work because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months And it was quite wonderful because I had an interest  an early interest  in theater thats justified on this thing In theater you have the character and the actor in the same place trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience And in this youd have like a  something that looks like a cloud and it is a cloud at the same time So theyre like perfect actors My interest in acting especially bad acting goes a long way Actually I once paid like  dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of King Lear and I felt really robbed because by the time the actor started being King Lear he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see On the other hand you know I paid like three dollars I think  and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of Othello by an amateur group And it was quite fascinating because you know the guy  his name was Joey Grimaldi  he impersonated the Moorish general  you know for the first three minutes he was really that general and then he went back into plumber he worked as a plumber so  plumber general plumber general  so for three dollars I saw two tragedies for the price of one See I think its not really about impression making people fall for a really perfect illusion as much as it is to make  I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion Because its not about fooling somebody its actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief how much you want to be fooled Thats why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that Well I think thats it My time is nearly up Thank you very much ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
