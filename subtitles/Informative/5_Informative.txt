What I want to talk about is as background is the idea that cars are art This is actually quite meaningful to me because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole  we dont do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it  and cars are thought so much as a product that its a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art And so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane  if you accept that  that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A Now at this point youre going to see a picture of Michelangelo This is completely different than automobiles Automobiles are selfmoving things right Elevators are automobiles And theyre not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for  years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways theyve also been a real pain in the ass because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve We have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion  but thats not what interests me in this speech What interests me in this speech is cars Automobiles may be what you use but cars are what we are in many ways And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and I believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like BMW is really hip on and lots of other things then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us  of this caryness  and what that means what we can learn from it Thats what I want to get to Cars are not a suit of clothes cars are an avatar Cars are an expansion of yourself they take your thoughts your ideas your emotions and they multiply it  your anger whatever Its an avatar Its a superwaldo that you happen to be inside of and if you feel sexy the car is sexy And if youre full of road rage youve got a Chevy Like a Rock right Cars are a sculpture  did you know this That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand Many people think Well its computers and its done by machines and stuff like that Well they reproduce it but the originals are all done by hand Its done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum That tension between the need to express the need to discover then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship Rules that say this is how you handle surfaces this is what control is all about this is how you show youre a master of your craft And that tension that discovery that push for something new  and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship  thats as strong in cars as it is in anything We work in clay which hasnt changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it and theres a very interesting analogy to that too Real quickly  Michelangelo once said hes there to discover the figure within OK There we go the automobile That was  years right there  did you catch that Between that one there and that one there it changed a lot didnt it OK its not marketing theres a very interesting car concept here but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here I want to talk about this Why it means you have to wash a car what is it that sensuality you have to touch about it Thats the sculpture that goes into it That sensuality And its done by men and women working just like this making cars Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore I believe that that pressure within that Moores talking about  at least when it comes to cars  comes right back to this idea of the mean Its that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me And we tell other people Do this do this do this until this thing comes alive We are completely infected And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness its quite wonderful This sculpture is of course at the heart of all of it and its really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars And its not a whole lot different really when theyre working like this or when somebody works like this Its that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty Now now I get to the point I want to talk about cars as art Art in the Platonic sense is truth its beauty and love Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers We dont really have a problem talking about love We dont have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense Thats what were searching for  when were working our craft we are really trying to find that truth out there Were not trying to find vanity and beauty Were trying to find the beauty in the truth However engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian instead of this quantum approach Were dealing with irrationalisms and were dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four and if you get  its better and  is even better And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why were doing what were doing Weve pretty much accepted the fact though that we are the women in the organization at BMW  BMW is a very manly type business  men men men its engineers And were kind of the female side to that Thats OK thats cool You go off and be manly Were going to be a little bit more female Because what were interested in is finding form thats more than just a function Were interested in finding beauty thats more than just an aesthetic its really a truth And I think this idea of soul as being at the heart of great cars is very applicable You all know it You know a car when youve seen it with soul You know how strong this is Well this experience of love and the experience of design to me are interchangeable And now Im coming to my story I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue And first of all you have to go with me for a second and say you know you could take the word love out of a lot of things in our society put the word design in and it still works like this quote here you know It kind of works you know You can understand that It works in truisms All is fair in design and war Certainly we live in a competitive society I think this one here theres a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me you know this is like you know this is like puppy love you know this is cool right Toothbrush cool It really only gets serious when you look at something like this OK This is one substitution that I believe all of us in design management are guilty of And this idea that there is more to love more to design when it gets down to your neighbor your other it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be But right now its in dealing with our own people our own teams who are doing the creating So to my story The idea of peoplework is what we work with here and I have to make a bond with my designers when were creating BMWs We have to have a shared intimacy a shared vision  that means we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way Theres good times theres interesting times and theres some stress times too You want to do cars youve got to go outside Youve got to do cars in the rain youve got to do cars in the snow Thats by the way is a presentation we made to our board of directors We haul their butts out in the snow too You want to know cars outside Well youve got to stand outside to do this And because these are artists they have very artistic temperaments All right Now one thing about art is art is discovery and art is discovering yourself through your art Right And one thing about cars is were all a little bit like Pygmalion we are completely in love with our own creations This is one of my favorite paintings it really describes our relationship with cars This is sick beyond belief But because of this the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension a new meaning We have a shared center we have a shared focus  that car stays at the middle of all our relationships And its my job in the competitive process to narrow this down I heard today about Josephs death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction You know thats what I have to do sometimes We start out with  cars we narrow it down to five cars down to three cars down to two cars down to one car and Im in the middle of that killing basically Someones love someones baby This is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this because their life is wrapped up in that too Theyve got that gene infected in them as well and they want that to live more than anything else Well this project Deep Blue put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected and I want to pass it on to you because I want you to reflect on this perhaps in your own relationships We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way wed done it that I only had a phone number that connected me to them So what we did was instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out whats the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America This is  we did this project And so we sent them off with this team name Deep Blue Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM  we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes theyd think were talking about computers It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue in a company like BMW has a hook  Deep Blue wow cool name So people get wrapped up in it And we took a team of designers and we sent them off to America And we gave them a budget what we thought was a set of deliverables a timetable and nothing else Like I said I just had a phone number that connected me to them And a group of engineers worked in Germany and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of whats the successor to the SUV They would come together compare notes Then they would work apart come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didnt pollute each others ideas  but at the same time came together and resolved the problems Hopefully really understand the customer at its heart where the customer is live with them in America So  sent the team off and actually something different happened They went other places They disappeared quite honestly and all I got was postcards Now I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls and pretty soon theyre in New York and I dont know where else And Im telling myself This is going to be a great car theyre doing research that Ive never even thought about before Right And they decided that instead of like having a studio and six or seven apartments it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylors exhouse in Malibu And  at least they told me it was her house I guess it was at one time she had a party there or something But anyway this was the house and they all lived there Now this is  living halfadozen people whod left their  some had left their wives behind and families behind and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America but the first three months were the most intensive And one of the young women in the project she was a fantastic lady she actually built her room in the bathroom The bathroom was so big she built the bed over the bathtub  its quite fascinating On the other hand I didnt know anything about this OK Nothing This is all going on and all Im getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas or whatever saying Dont worry Chris this is really going to be good OK So my concept of what a design studio was probably  I wasnt up to speed on where these guys were However the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin and you know these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer And one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings and these incredibly stressedout engineers would create some incredible solutions Well what I didnt know was and what we found out was  these guys they cant even like talk to each other under those conditions You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split in your dialog that is so deep and so far that they cannot bring this together at all And so we had our first meeting after three months in Tiburon which is just up the road from here  you know Tiburon And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr Goschel  who is now my boss and at that time he was comentor on the project  and they would present their results We would see where we were going we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America And so I had these ideas in my head that this is going to be great I mean Im going to see so much work its so intense  I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it and Im not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either  but somehow all this is going to come together and Im going to see some really great product So we went to Tiburon after three months and the team had gotten together the week before many days ahead of time The engineers flew over and designers got together with them and they put their presentation together Well it turns out that the engineers hadnt done anything And they hadnt done anything because  kind of like in car business engineers are there to solve problems and we were asking them to create a problem And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say This is the problem that weve created now help us solve it And they couldnt talk about it So what happened was the engineers showed up with nothing And the engineers told the designers If you go in with all your stuff well walk out well walk right out of the project So I didnt know any of this and we got a presentation that had an agenda looked like this There was a whole lot of dialog We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers And here Im expecting at any moment OK theyre going to turn the page and Im going to see the cars Im going to see the sketches Im going to see maybe some idea of where its going Dialog kept on going with mental maps of words and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance I was seriously being baffled with bullshit And if you can imagine what this is like to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working and theyre out there spending all this money and theyre learning and theyre doing all this stuff I went fucking ballistic right I went nuts You can probably remember Tiburon it used to look like this After four hours of this I stood up and I took this team apart I screamed at them I yelled at them What the hell are you doing Youre letting me down youre my designers youre supposed to be the creative ones what the hell is going on around here It was probably one of my better tirades I have some good ones but this was probably one of my better ones And I went into these people how could they take BMWs money how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing nothing Because of course they didnt tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings model concepts pictures  everything I wanted theyd locked up in the cars because they had shown solidarity with the engineers  and theyd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadnt realized of course that they couldnt do problem creating So we went to lunch  And Ive got to tell you this was one seriously quiet lunch The engineers all sat at one end of the table the designers and I sat at the other end of the table really quiet And I was just fucking furious furious OK Probably because they had all the fun and I didnt you know Thats what you get furious about right And somebody asked me about Catherine my wife you know did she fly out with me or something I said No and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married the priest gave a very nice sermon and he said something very important He said Love is not selfish he said Love does not mean counting how many times I say I love you It doesnt mean you had sex this many times this month and its two times less than last month so that means you dont love me as much Love is not selfish And I thought about this and I thought You know Im not showing love here Im seriously not showing love Im in the air Im in the air without trust This cannot be This cannot be that Im expecting a certain number of sketches and to me thats my quantification method for qualifying a team This cannot be So I told them this story I said Guys Im thinking about something here this isnt right I cant have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one Based on a dictate premise that says Im a boss you do what I say without trust I said This cant be Actually we all broke down into tears to be quite honest about it because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them not being able to show me what I wanted and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come And I think we felt much closer that day we cut a lot of strings that didnt need to be there and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about We put the car back at the center of our thoughts and we put love I think truly back into the center of the process By the way that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes  you see it downstairs the X Coupe  they had a lot of fun with that It was the rendition of our motorcycle the GS as Carl Magnusson says bruteiful as the idea of what could be a motorcycle if you add two more wheels And so in conclusion my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you was this one here Im also going to steal a little quote out of Little Prince Theres a lot to be said about trust and love if you know that those two words are synonymous for design I had a very very meaningful relationship with my team that day and its stayed that way ever since And I hope that you too find that theres more to design and more towards the art of the design than doing it yourself Its true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile Thanks so much
