In terms of invention Id like to tell you the tale
of one of my favorite projects I think its one of the most exciting
that Im working on but I think its also the simplest Its a project that has the potential
to make a huge impact around the world It addresses one of the biggest
health issues on the planet the number one cause of death
in children under five Which is  Waterborne diseases
Diarrhea Malnutrition No Its breathing the smoke
from indoor cooking fires  acute respiratory infections
caused by this Can you believe that I find this shocking
and somewhat appalling Cant we make
cleaner burning cooking fuels Cant we make better stoves How is it that this can lead
to over two million deaths every year I know Bill Joy was talking to you
about the wonders of carbon nanotubes so Im going to talk to you
about the wonders of carbon macrotubes which is charcoal So this is a picture of rural Haiti Haiti is now  percent deforested Youll see scenes like this
all over the island It leads to all sorts
of environmental problems and problems that affect people
throughout the nation A couple years ago
there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths  thats directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills
to stabilize the soil So the rains come  they go down the rivers
and the flooding happens Now one of the reasons
why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood
and they make charcoal in order to do it Its not that people are ignorant
to the environmental damage They know perfectly well
but they have no other choice Fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesnt cook the way
that they like their food prepared And so this is what they do Youll find families like this who go out
into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it So not surprisingly theres a lot of effort thats been done
to look at alternative cooking fuels About four years ago I took
a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with
Peace Corps volunteers there This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built
in the village where he worked And the idea was
that you could take waste paper you could compress it and make briquettes
that could be used for fuel But this device was very slow So our engineering students
went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple
the throughput of this device So you could imagine
they were very excited about it And they took the briquettes back to MIT
so that they could test them And one of the things
that they found was they didnt burn So it was a little
discouraging to the students And in fact if you look closely right here you can see
it says US Peace Corps As it turns out there actually wasnt
any waste paper in this village And while it was a good use
of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it
back with him to his village it was  kilometers away And so we thought perhaps
there might be a better way to come up with
an alternative cooking fuel What we wanted to do
is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was
readily available on the local level You see these all over Haiti as well Theyre smallscale sugar mills And the waste product from them after you extract the juice
from the sugarcane is called bagasse It has no other use It has no nutritional value
so they dont feed it to the animals It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill
until eventually they burn it What we wanted to do was
we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource
and turn it into a fuel that would be something
that people could easily cook with something like charcoal So over the next couple of years students and I worked
to develop a process So you start with the bagasse
and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of
a waste fifty fivegallon oil drum After some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen
that goes into the kiln and then you end up
with this carbonized material here However you cant burn this Its too fine and it burns too quickly
to be useful for cooking So we had to try to find a way
to form it into useful briquettes And conveniently
one of my students was from Ghana and he remembered a dish his mom
used to make for him called kokonte which is a very sticky porridge
made out of the cassava root And so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava
is indeed grown in Haiti under the name of manioc In fact its grown all over the world  yucca tapioca manioc cassava
its all the same thing  a very starchy root vegetable And you can make a very thick
sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together
the charcoal briquettes So we did this We went down to Haiti These are the graduates
of the first Ecole de Charbon or Charcoal Institute And these  Thats right So Im actually
an instructor at MIT as well as CIT And these are the briquettes that we made Now Im going to take you
to a different continent This is India and this is the most commonly used
cooking fuel in India Its cow dung And more than in Haiti
this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see
the health impacts of cooking with cow dung
and biomass as a fuel Kids and women
are especially affected by it because theyre the ones
who are around the cooking fires So we wanted to see if we could introduce
this charcoalmaking technology there Well unfortunately
they didnt have sugarcane and they didnt have cassava but that didnt stop us What we did was we found what were
the locally available sources of biomass And there was wheat straw
and there was rice straw in this area And what we could use as a binder
was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel And we did sidebyside tests and here you can see
the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung And you can see that its a lot cleaner
burning of a cooking fuel And in fact it heats the water
a lot more quickly And so we were very happy thus far But one of the things that we found was when we did sidebyside
comparisons with wood charcoal it didnt burn as long And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart
as they were cooking So we wanted to try to find a way
to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with
wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti So we went back to MIT we took out the Instron machine and we figured out
what sort of forces you needed in order to compress
a briquette to the level that you actually are getting
improved performance out of it And at the same time that we had
students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners in Haiti
working to develop the process to improve it and make it more accessible
to people in the villages there And after some time we developed a lowcost press
that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns not only  actually it burns longer
cleaner than wood charcoal So now were in a situation
where we have a product which is actually better than what
you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace which is a very wonderful place to be In Haiti alone about  million trees
are cut down every year Theres a possibility
of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those In addition the revenue generated
from that charcoal is  million dollars Thats an awful lot
for a country like Haiti  with a population of eight million and an average income
of less than  dollars So this is where were also moving ahead
with our charcoal project And one of the things
that I think is also interesting is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley
whos been doing risk analysis And hes looked at the problem
of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal And hes found that worldwide
you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood
to charcoal as a cooking fuel Thats remarkable but up until now there werent ways
to do it without cutting down trees But now we have a way thats using an agricultural
waste material to create a cooking fuel One of the really exciting things though is something that came out of the trip
that I took to Ghana just last month And I think its the coolest thing and its even lower tech
than what you just saw if you can imagine such a thing Here it is So what is this This is corncobs turned into charcoal And the beauty of this is
that you dont need to form briquettes  it comes ready made This is my  laptop right here And actually like Nick
I brought samples So we can pass these around Theyre fully functional
fieldtested ready to roll out And I think one of the things which is also remarkable
about this technology is that the technology
transfer is so easy Compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we have to teach people
how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step
of cooking the binder this comes prebriquetted And this is about the most exciting
thing in my life right now which is perhaps
a sad commentary on my life But once you see it
like you guys in the front row  All right yeah OK So anyway  Here it is And this is I think a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about
in those nonzerosum things So not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits But this is one
of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits People can make their own cooking fuel
from waste products They can generate income from this They can save the money
that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess
and sell it in the market to people who arent making their own Its really rare
that you dont have tradeoffs between health and economics
or environment and economics So this is a project
that I just find extremely exciting and Im really looking forward
to see where it takes us So when we talk about now
the future we will create one of the things
that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision
of the world that we live in And now I dont actually mean
the world that we live in I mean the world where women
spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat I mean the world
where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles
that are made by hand and where when you work  hours a day youre still only earning
 dollars in a month I mean the world where women and children spend
 billion hours a year fetching water Thats as if the entire workforce
of the state of California worked full time for a year
doing nothing but fetching water Its a place where
for example if this were India in this room only three of us
would have a car If this were Afghanistan only one person in this room
would know how the use the Internet If this were Zambia   of you would be farmers  of you would have AIDS or HIV And more than half of you would be living
on less than a dollar a day These are the issues that we
need to come up with solutions for These are the issues that
we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people
our entrepreneurs to be facing These are the solutions
that we need to find I have a few areas that I believe
are especially important that we address One of them is creating technologies to promote microfinance
and microenterprise so that people who are living
below the poverty line can find a way to move out  and that theyre not doing it using the same traditional
basket making poultry rearing etc But there are new technologies
and new products that they can make on a small scale The next thing I believe is that we need to create
technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops And we need to rethink
our development strategies so that were not promoting
educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers but rather to stop being poor farmers And we need to think
about how we can do that effectively We need to work with the people
in these communities and give them the resources
and the tools that they need to solve their own problems Thats the best way to do it We shouldnt be doing it from outside So we need to create this future
and we need to start doing it now Thank you Chris Anderson Thank you incredible Stay here Tell us  just while we see
if someone has a question  just tell us about one of the other things
that youve worked on Amy Smith Some of the other
things were working on are ways to do lowcost
water quality testing so that communities can maintain
their own water systems know when theyre working
know when they treat them etc Were also looking at lowcost
watertreatment systems One of the really exciting things
is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability
to be able to do that CA Whats the bottleneck
preventing this stuff getting from scale Do you need to find entrepreneurs
or venture capitalists or what do you need to take
what youve got and get it to scale AS I think its large numbers
of people moving it forward Its a difficult thing  its a marketplace
which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income So you cant use the same models
that you use in the United States for making things move forward And were a pretty small staff which is me So you know
I do what I can with the students We have  students a year
go out into the field and try to implement this
and move it forward The other thing is you have to do things
with a long time frame as you know you cant expect to get
something done in a year or two years you have to be looking
five or  years ahead But I think with the vision to do that
we can move forward
