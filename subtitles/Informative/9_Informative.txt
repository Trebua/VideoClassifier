As you pointed out every time you come here you learn something This morning the worlds experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats I think concluded that ultimately the solution is people shouldnt sit down I could have told them that Yesterday the automotive guys gave us some new insights They pointed out that I believe it was between  and  years from today they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff Thats reassuring They then pointed out that thered be sort of the other controls by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff Thats pretty good but why not get rid of the wires Then you dont need anything to control the car except thinking about it I would love to talk about the technology and sometime in whats past the  minutes Ill be happy to talk to all the technogeeks around here about whats in here But if I had one thing to say about this before we get to first it would be that from the time we started building this the big idea wasnt the technology It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community The big idea here is I think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation And maybe to put that in perspective theres so much data on this Ill be happy to give it to you in different forms You never know what strikes the fancy of whom but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world And Henry Ford just about  years ago started cranking out Model Ts What I dont think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied For instance in that time  percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns So the car  the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage  was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage It was half as long And it was an environmental improvement because for instance in  they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm or their farm to a town or from a town to a city It all made sense with  percent of the people living there By the s we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world the highway system And it is certainly a wonder And by the way as I take shots at old technologies I want to assure everybody and particularly the automotive industry  whos been very supportive of us  that I dont think this in any way competes with airplanes or cars But think about where the world is today  percent of the global population now lives in cities Thats  billion people Weve solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today  years ago sailing ships started getting reliable enough we found a new continent  years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country Over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the  years weve connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that But during that entire process more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving to cities China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half And so nobody I think would argue that airplanes in the last  years have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood And if you just look at how technology has been applied weve solved all the longrange highspeed highvolume largeweight problems of moving things around Nobody would want to give them up And I certainly wouldnt want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my Humvee or my Porsche I love them all I dont keep any of them in my living room The fact is the last mile is the problem and half the world now lives in dense cities And people spend depending on who they are between  and  percent of their energy getting around on foot I think theres  I dont know what data would impress you but how about  percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices particularly sitting in cities And again I say that not to attack any industry I think  I really do  I love my airplane and cars on highways moving  miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient both from an engineering point of view an energy consumption point of view and a utility point of view And we all love our cars and I do The problem is you get into the city and you want to go four blocks its neither fun nor efficient nor productive Its not sustainable If  in China in the year   million people used bicycles  million people used cars If five percent of that population became quote middle class and wanted to go the way weve gone in the last hundred years at the same time that  percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan every six weeks  it isnt sustainable environmentally it isnt sustainable economically  there just aint enough oil  and its not sustainable politically I mean what are we fighting over right now We can make it complicated but whats the world fighting over right now So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile and it was dumb luck We were working on iBOTs but once we made this we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis You dont need the water Or snowmobiles You dont need the snow Or skiing Its just fun and people love to move around doing fun things And every one of those industries by the way  just golf carts alone is a multibilliondollar industry But rather than go license this off which is what we normally do it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology but into an understanding of a world thats solved all its other problems but has somehow come to accept that cities  which right back from ancient Greece on were meant to walk around cities that were architected and built for people  now have a footprint that while weve solved every other transportation problem  and its like Moores law I mean look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon then on a railroad then an airplane Every other form of transportations been improved In  years weve gone backwards in getting around cities Theyve gotten bigger theyre spread out The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city  Wilshire Boulevard or Fifth Avenue or Tokyo or Paris  the most expensive real estate is their downtowns  percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars The  largest cities in the world So you wonder what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities What if you could make them fun attractive clean environmentally friendly What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this as that last link to mass transit to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want and then have our cities energized again We thought it would be really neat to do that and one of the problems we really were worried about is how do we get legal on the sidewalk Because technically Ive got motors Ive got wheels  Im a motor vehicle I dont look like a motor vehicle I have the same footprint as a pedestrian I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space I took this down to Ground Zero and knocked my way through crowds for an hour Im a pedestrian But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and if we get told we dont belong on the sidewalk we have two choices Were a recreational vehicle that doesnt really matter and I dont spend my time doing that kind of stuff Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle Weve been so concerned about that we went to the Postmaster General of the United States as the first person we ever showed on the outside and said Put your people on it Everybody trusts their postman And they belong on the sidewalks and theyll use it seriously He agreed We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat carrying  pounds of stuff They love it And I cant believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket So weve been working really really hard but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about whats important and how to apply the technology We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted So Im happy really I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want And yes its really fun and yes you should all go out and try it But if I could ask you to do one thing its not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine that although we all understand somehow that its reasonable that we use our pound machine which can go  miles an hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow its also what we used for the last mile and its broken and it doesnt work One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted happened out here in California A few weeks ago after we launched it we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach zipping up and back and hes marveling at the technology and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by and skateboarders are zipping by and a little old lady  I mean if you looked in the dictionary a little old lady  came by me  and now that Im on this Im the height of a normal adult now  and she just stops and the camera is there and she looks up at me and says Can I try that And what was I  you know how are you going to say anything And so I said Sure So I get off and she gets on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turns around and she goes about  feet and she turns back around and shes all smiles And she comes back to me and she stops and she says Finally they made something for us And the camera is looking down at her Im thinking Wow that was great   please lady dont say another word And the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said What do you mean by that And I figured Its all over now and she looks up and she says Well shes still watching these guys go she says I cant ride a bike no she says I cant use a skateboard and Ive never used roller blades she knew them by name she says And its been  years since I rode a bicycle Then she looks up shes looking up and she says And Im  years old and I dont drive a car anymore I still have to get to the store and I cant carry a lot of things And it suddenly occurred to me that among my many fears were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it  it was that fundamentally you believe theres pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left the sidewalks in these cities When you look at the  inches of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the parked car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet  its  that little piece is all thats there But she looks up and says this and it occurs to me well kids arent going to mind these things and they dont vote and business people and then young adults arent going to mind these things  theyre pretty cool  so I guess subliminally I was worried that its the older population thats going to worry So having seen this and having worried about it for eight years the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys call AARP get an appointment right away Weve got to show them this thing And they took it to Washington they showed them and theyre going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities like Atlanta where were doing trials to see if it really can in fact help reenergize their downtown The bottom line is whether you believe the United Nations or any of the other think tanks  in the next  years all human population growth on this planet will be in cities In Asia alone it will be over a billion people They learned to start with cell phones They didnt have to take the year trip we took They start at the top of the technology food chain Weve got to start building cities and human environments where a pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense rich greenspace environment without being in a pound machine to do it Cars were not meant for parallel parking theyre wonderful machines to go between cities but just think about it weve solved all the longrange highspeed problems The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals You do it in your sneakers Not much has changed If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking  three times  a minute walk becomes  minutes Your choice when living in a city if its now  minutes  because at  minutes you want an alternative whether its a bus a train  weve got to build an infrastructure  a light rail  or youre going to keep parking those cars But if you could put a pin in most cities and imagine how far you could if you had the time walk in one halfhour its the city If you could make it fun and make it eight or  minutes you cant find your car unpark your car move your car repark your car and go somewhere you cant get to a cab or a subway We could change the way people allocate their resources the way this planet uses its energy make it more fun And were hoping to some extent history will say we were right Thats Segway This is a Stirling cycle engine this had been confused by a lot of things were doing This little beast right now is producing a few hundred watts of electricity Yes it could be attached to this and yes on a kilogram of propane you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is itll burn any fuel because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact where most of the world you cant simply plug into your volt outlet Weve been working on this actually as an alternative energy source starting way back with Johnson amp Johnson to run an iBOT because the best batteries you could get   watthours per kilogram in lead  watthours per kilogram nickelcadmium  watthours per kilogram in nickelmetal hydride  watthours per kilogram in lithium  watthours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline  which is why nobody drives electric cars But in any event if you can burn it with the same efficiency  because its external combustion  as your kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turns out to be pretty neat It makes just enough electricity to for instance do this which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as Mr Holly  Dr Holly  pointed out can run computers and a light bulb But more interestingly the thermodynamics of this say youre never going to get more than  percent efficiency It doesnt matter much  it says if you get  watts of electricity youll get  or  watts of heat If you wanted to boil water and recondense it at a rate of  gallons an hour it takes about  a little over  kilowatt   watts of continuous power  to do it Thats so much energy you couldnt afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way Certainly in the rest of the world your choice is to devastate the place turning everything that will burn into heat or drink the water thats available The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water Depending on whose numbers you believe its between  and  people per day We dont need sophisticated heart transplants around the world We need water And women shouldnt have to spend four hours a day looking for it or watching their kids die We figured out how to put a vaporcompression distiller on this thing with a counterflow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for  watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat it will make  gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it So if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a solution to transportation electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs  pounds I dont know but well try it I better shut up
